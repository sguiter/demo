Due to uncertainty of the collectability of the principal amount of the Convertible Note, we have established an allowance for the entire amount, and we have not accrued any interest receivable in connection with the Convertible Note.

The Company has prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. If the Company encounters unforeseen circumstances that place constraints on its capital resources, management will be required to take various measures to conserve liquidity. Management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be able to execute its plans to raise additional capital, close its merger and acquisitions, or that its operations or business plan will be profitable.

 As previously disclosed, on May 23, 2024, we issued a promissory note to Ballengee Holdings, LLC, in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000, for which loan advances of 804,150 have been made to the Company. 
 
 Additionally, on July 5, 2024, the Company received a loan from Ballengee Holdings, LLC, in the principal amount of 500,000, and in connection therewith, we agreed to issue 21,552 50,000) restricted shares of the Company s common stock, which is currently accrued in related party accounts payable in stock until the shares are issued. The loan bears interest at the rate of 10 per annum. The loan originally matured on December 31, 2024 and was amended on July 19, 2024 to mature on September 30, 2025. The note allows the holder to convert the outstanding principal and interest due under the note into shares of our common stock at price equal to 90 of the average closing price of our common stock for the previous five (5) trading days prior to the conversion date, with a floor conversion price of 1.00 per share. The lender may not convert amounts owed under the note if such conversion would cause him to own more than 4.99 of our common stock after giving effect to the issuance, which limitation may be raised to 9.99 upon from the lender.

per month over four years, with an early buyout option or option at the end of the base term to purchase the wash plant equipment for approximately or lease-end option to purchase the facilities for the fair market value. We anticipate that the lease will commence in the first quarter of 2025. 

On June 18, 2024, our subsidiary WCCC, entered into a supplement Supplement No. 3 to an existing Master Agreement (the Master Agreement with Maxus. Under Supplement No. 3, Maxus agreed to finance approximately 1 million for the build-out of certain equipment and facilities related to the wash plant we are in the process of constructing on land leased by our subsidiary, VivaVentures Remediation Corp., in Houston, Texas. Once the relevant equipment is constructed Maxus will own the equipment and we will lease these additions to our wash plant facility from Maxus under the terms of Supplement No. 3. Under the terms of the lease, we expect our lease payments to Maxus to be approximately per month over four years, with an early buyout option or option at the end of the base term to purchase the wash plant equipment for approximately or lease-end option to purchase the facilities for the fair market value. We anticipate that the lease will commence in the first quarter of 2025. 

As previously disclosed, on May 23, 2023 we entered into a supplement Supplement No. 2 to the Master Agreement Maxus, under which Maxus funded approximately 2.2 million to finance the build-out of other Houston wash plant equipment additions, which such lease was anticipated to commence in the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we anticipate that this lease will now commence in the first quarter of 2025. Under the terms of this lease, we expect our lease payments to Maxus under the supplement to be approximately per month over four years, with an early buyout option of approximately or lease-end option to purchase the facilities for the fair market value. 

Because we were involved in the construction of the wash plant and the Texas pipeline extension, and were responsible for paying a portion of the construction costs, we evaluated the control criteria in build to suit lease accounting guidance under GAAP ASC 842 (Leases) where the Company was deemed, for accounting purposes, to have control of the wash plant and pipeline extension during the construction period. Accordingly, the Company recorded project construction costs incurred during the construction period for the wash plant and pipeline extension incurred by the landlord as a construction-in-process asset and a related financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. The total of the projects construction costs have been capitalized and recorded to construction-in-process within Property and equipment, net . The total 3.9 million of construction costs funded by Maxus have been recorded as a component of Accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Results of Operations for the Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we realized revenues of 15,916,423 and 16,313,406, respectively, representing a decrease of 396,983 or 2.43 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we realized revenues of 48,118,936 and 45,448,916, respectively, representing an increase of 2,670,020 or 5.87 . The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to an average increase in crude oil product volumes purchased and sold for our oil and natural gas liquid products since September 30, 2023. 

Cost of Revenue 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of revenues consisted primarily of costs associated with selling oil and natural gas liquid through the operations from our business in SFD and WCCC. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, costs of revenue were 14,190,073 and 14,766,494, respectively, representing a decrease of 576,421 or 3.90 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, costs of revenue were 44,213,635 and 41,174,082, respectively, representing an increase of 3,039,553 or 7.38 . The increase in cost of revenues is primarily attributed to an average increase in market prices and the Company increased its crude oil product volumes purchases for our oil and natural gas liquid inventory purchases since September 30, 2023. 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we realized gross profit of 1,726,350 and 1,546,912, respectively, representing a decrease of 179,438 or 11,60 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we realized gross profit of 3,905,301 and 4,274,834, respectively, representing a decrease of 369,533 or 8.64 . The decrease in gross profit is related net effect of an average increase in market and transportation costs for oil purchases and an increase in crude oil product volumes purchased and sold of our oil and natural gas liquid products. 

Operating Expenses 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we realized operating expenses of 3,684,987 and 2,292,026, which represents an increase of 1,392,961, or 60.77 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we realized operating expenses of 10,333,274 and 6,982,754, which represents an increase of 3,350,520, or 47.98 . The increase in operating expenses is attributed to the net effect of new executive employment and board of director agreements, which increased employee compensation expense by approximately 1 million, including stock compensation expense related to new or renewed executive employment and board of director agreements, which issued immediate and vesting stock awards of approximately 650,000, amortization expense of approximately 800,000 related to lease accounting interest, and increased professional services of approximately 1 million related to merger, acquisition, and corporate governance services. 

31 

Interest Expense 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we realized total interest expense of 641,244 and 1,345,096, which represents a decrease of 703,852, or 52.33 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we realized interest expense of 1,565,231 and 3,814,253, which represents a decrease of 2,249,022, or 58.96 . The decrease in interest expense is mainly attributable to our amendment of our note issued as consideration in the MIPA approved by the shareholders on November 10, 2023. As the amendment was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470 Debt ASC 470 , the note was thus written to the amount of the undiscounted future cash flows on the note to maturity, and therefore no interest expense is realized for the remainder of the note to maturity. 

Unrealized Loss on Marketable Securities 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported an unrealized gain of 826,377 and an unrealized loss of 661,101, which represents an increase of 1,487,478, or 225 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported an unrealized gain of 743,739 and an unrealized loss of 991,652, which represents an increase of 1,735,391, or 175 . Our marketable securities were considered to be traded on an active market and were accounted for at a fair value based on the quoted prices in the active markets resulting in aggregate unrealized gains or losses as noted above. 

Gain on Deconsolidation of Subsidiary 

In accordance with ASC 810, as of February 15, 2024, we deconsolidated VivaSphere, Inc. (VivaSphere), recognizing a gain on deconsolidation of 177,550. The assets, liabilities, and equity related to VivaSphere was removed from our financial statements (Note 1), resulting in a gain on deconsolidation. 

Cash flows 

The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as presented below:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have historically suffered net losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations, and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 72.8 million. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had a working capital deficit of approximately 42.5 million and 19 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately 687 thousand. As of September 30, 2024, we have current obligations to pay approximately 24.8 million of debt. Of the 24.8 million, 13.8 million can be satisfied through the issuance of registered common stock under the terms of the debt. Approximately 13 million 9.1 million of unearned revenue 3.9 million in accounts payable (Note 5)) is related to the sale leaseback of our Remediation Processing Unit A B, wash plant facilities, and our White Claw Colorado City site pipeline extension. Once construction is completed of these sites, of the 13 million approximately 7.1 million will be financed over eight years and 3.9 million (Note 7) will be financed over four years. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 687,172 and 744,307, respectively. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, subject to available cash flows, we continued to develop our technologies, strategy to monetize our intellectual properties and execute our business plan. To date we have financed our operations primarily through debt financing, private and public equity offerings and our working interest agreements. For the fiscal year 2023 we raised approximately 3 million through debt financings with individual investors, 2.2 million through a sale lease back agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we raised an additional 4.7 million through debt financings and 1.4 million through the sale of common stock. 

32 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net cash used in operating activities was mainly comprised of net effect of the consolidated net loss of 6,983,978 and 7,391,089, and our depreciation and amortization of 3,062,416 and 2,269,445. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-based compensation of 1,626,409 and 1,260,476 in lieu of using cash. We also realized interest expense on loans and notes payable of 1,115,347 and 3,058,522, an (increase) decrease in accounts receivable of 1,753,918 and 442,307), and as increase (decrease) in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 1,184,103 and 929,360). 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net cash used in investing activities was mainly attributed to our purchase of equipment of 2,362,898 and 3,841,589 related to the manufacturing of our RPC, wash plant facilities, and a White Claw Colorado City site extension on our pipeline. 

Our net cash provided by our financing activities was mainly attributed to the net effect of the following events: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received proceeds of 4,669,459 and 4,499,958 related to the issuance of notes and other loans of which 1,304,150 and 776,500 were from related parties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received proceeds from the sale of common stock of 1,425,000 and none. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid down notes payable and lease liabilities by 3,954,055 and 782,808, of which 2,150,537 and 482,815 were to related parties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made distributions to Viva Wealth Fund I, LLC (which was deconsolidated later on October 1, 2023) unit holders of 1,020,564. 

Capitalized interest on construction in process was 1,015,402 and 735,919 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There are no further existing firm obligations; however, we anticipate further construction costs of approximately 1.5 million in connection with our construction of our Texas remediation and wash plant facilities; and construction for each Nanosponge costs approximately 200,000, and we intend to manufacture and add a Nanosponge to our current and future RPCs. 

Our ability to continue to access capital could be affected adversely by various factors, including general market and other economic conditions, interest rates, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. If we cannot raise capital through public or private debt financings, equity offerings, or other means, our ability to grow our business may be negatively affected. In such case, we may need to suspend site and plant construction or further acquisitions until market conditions improve. 

Contractual Obligations 

Our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 for finance lease liabilities are for the sale and leaseback of certain land, property, plant, and equipment that were acquired in the closing of our business combination, which acquired SFD and WCCC on August 1, 2022, which leases end in 2025 and 2026. Finance lease obligations as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:

On August 9, 2024, our subsidiary White Claw Colorado City, LLC WCCC ), entered into a supplement Supplement No. 4 to an existing Master Agreement (the Master Agreement with Maxus Capital Group, LLC Maxus ). Under Supplement No. 4, Maxus agreed to finance approximately 2.1 million for the build-out of certain equipment and facilities related to a pipeline extension at our WCCC facility in Texas. Once the relevant equipment is constructed Maxus will own the addition and we will lease these additions from Maxus under the terms of Supplement No. 4. Under the terms of the lease, we expect our lease payments to Maxus to be approximately 32,161 per month over four years, with an early buyout option or option at the end of the base term to purchase the wash plant equipment for approximately 374,702 or lease-end option to purchase the facilities for the fair market value. We anticipate that the lease will commence in the first quarter of 2025. 

33 

On June 18, 2024, our subsidiary WCCC, entered into a supplement Supplement No. 3 to an existing Master Agreement (the Master Agreement with Maxus. Under Supplement No. 3, Maxus agreed to finance approximately 1 million for the build-out of certain equipment and facilities related to the wash plant we are in the process of constructing on land leased by our subsidiary, VivaVentures Remediation Corp., in Houston, Texas. Once the relevant equipment is constructed Maxus will own the equipment and we will lease these additions to our wash plant facility from Maxus under the terms of Supplement No. 3. Under the terms of the lease, we expect our lease payments to Maxus to be approximately 58,595 per month over four years, with an early buyout option or option at the end of the base term to purchase the wash plant equipment for approximately 683,000 or lease-end option to purchase the facilities for the fair market value. We anticipate that the lease will commence in the first quarter of 2025. 

On May 23, 2023 we entered into a supplement Supplement No. 2 to the Master Agreement Maxus, under which Maxus funded approximately 2.2 million to finance the build-out of other Houston wash plant equipment additions, which such lease was anticipated to commence in the second quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we anticipate that this lease will now commence in the first quarter of 2025. Under the terms of this lease, we expect our lease payments to Maxus under the supplement to be approximately 57,962 per month over four years, with an early buyout option of approximately 685,000 or lease-end option to purchase the facilities for the fair market value. 

Because we were involved in the construction of the wash plant and the Texas pipeline extension, and were responsible for paying a portion of the construction costs, we evaluated the control criteria in build to suit lease accounting guidance under GAAP ASC 842 (Leases) where the Company was deemed, for accounting purposes, to have control of the wash plant and pipeline extension during the construction period. Accordingly, the Company recorded project construction costs incurred during the construction period for the wash plant and pipeline extension incurred by the landlord as a construction-in-process asset and a related financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. The total of the projects construction costs have been capitalized and recorded to construction-in-process within Property and equipment, net . The total 3.9 million of construction costs funded by Maxus have been recorded as a component of Accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 for operating lease liabilities are for office and warehouse space, which leases end in 2024 and 2025, and a land lease which ends in 2042. Operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:

Interest Rate and Market Risk 

Interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income and other rate-sensitive income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates. We do not have variable interest rate-sensitive income agreements. We do have financing arrangements that were issued on August 1, 2022 as consideration for the business combination and acquisition of SFD and WCCC, in which the three year notes have variable interest rates based on the prime rate, which exposes us to further interest expense if the prime rate increases. 

Market Risk - Equity Investments 

Market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed-income securities, equity securities, other earning assets, and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors. We own equity securities that are publicly traded. Because the fair value of these securities may fall below the cost at which we acquired them, we are exposed to the possibility of loss. Equity investments are approved, monitored, and evaluated by members of management. 

34 

Inflation 

Prolonged periods of slow growth, significant inflationary pressures, volatility and disruption in financial markets, could lead to increased costs of doing business. Inflation generally will cause suppliers to increase their rates, and inflation may also increase employee salaries and benefits. In connection with such rate increases, we may or may not be able to increase our pricing to consumers. Inflation could cause both our investment and cost of revenue to increase, thereby lowering our return on investment and depressing our gross margins. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Critical Accounting Policies Use of Estimates 

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and the use of estimates from these disclosures reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact there are resource constraints and management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

35 

Based on management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable assurance level and are ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The material weaknesses, which relate to internal control over financial reporting, that were identified are: (1) We did not have enough personnel in our accounting and financial reporting functions. Due to insufficient personnel in our accounting department, we were not able to achieve adequate segregation of duties, and, as a result, we did not have adequate review controls surrounding: (i) our technical accounting matters in our financial reporting process, and (ii) the work of specialists involved in the estimation process. (2) Due to new relationships with a small banking institution and consultants in 2023, we were not able to achieve adequate controls surrounding the review and dual authorization of certain treasury transactions and fixed assets. (3) We did not always follow certain review and authorization procedures related to corporate governance and the release of information to the public. After failing to adhere to certain corporate governance administrative procedures, we did not achieve adequate review at the executive or independent Board of Director level over certain accounting and risk assessments or the timely reporting of material transactions. We also did not achieve adequate review of certain public reports and disclosures prior to the public disclosure of the information. These control deficiencies, which are pervasive in nature, result in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result in both proper drafting, review, authorization, recording and reporting of these transactions. Since our assessment as of September 30, 2024, we have continued to hire additional experienced executives, and we are working to retain additional qualified valuation experts that report on their internal controls. We have also implemented further review controls and processes surrounding treasury and fixed assets, and the Audit Committee is reviewing the material weaknesses, and will be making recommendations to the Company on implementing further internal controls to assist the Company to adhere to its corporate review, authorization, and reporting policies. 

We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As noted above, we continue to contract with additional external accounting staff in order to attempt to remediate our material weaknesses. Such changes include multiple additional reviewers of financial information before it is submitted for filing with the SEC. We have also instituted further internal controls surrounding treasury, so that proper dual authorization is required by our banking institutions to process capital expenditures in 2024. There were no other changes in our internal controls identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, we may become involved in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. We intend to defend vigorously against any future claims and litigation. We are not currently involved in any material disputes and do not have any material litigation matters pending. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, except as follows: 

On October 1, 2024, we closed the acquisition of the Endeavor Entities. We are in the process of integrating their operations and personnel with our own. If we are unable to complete this transition timely and effectively it could adversely affect our operations. 

We are in the process of integrating the Endeavor Entities personnel and operations into our operations since we close the acquisition on October 1, 2024. Due to the size of the acquisition, we anticipate this transition will take some time. If we are not able to effectively and timely complete this transition it could adversely affect our operations. 

The required Final Closing Statement for our acquisition of the Endeavor Entities has not been completed. We have also not completed the final purchase price accounting for the acquisition. Once these are completed, they may differ from our pre-closing expectations, which if they differ significantly could materially affect our business and financial results. 

Under the Endeavor MIPA (as defined herein), the Endeavor Entities do not need to deliver certain final documents to us until after closing, such as the Final Closing Statement, which is due 60 days after closing. Additionally, our final purchase price accounting for the acquisition is not due until September 30, 2025, and is subject to a full valuation report. Once completed, if the results differ significantly from our pre-closing expectations, it may materially impact our business and financial results. 

Prior to our acquisition of the Endeavor Entities, they were private companies and, as a result, they did not have the same audit and review of financial statements requirements that we have, and their disclosure controls and procedures processes for financial reporting were not the same as a reporting, public company. We anticipate we will have additional material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting during the time that we integrate their financial reporting processes with our financial reporting processes. 

As private companies the Endeavor Entities did not have the same requirements for audited and reviewed financial statements that we do as a public company reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). As a result, the methods the Endeavor Entities used to prepare their financial statements, as well as the disclosure controls and procedures they had in place around the preparation of such financial statements, may not have been as stringent as the requirements we have as a public company reporting under the Exchange Act. If this is the case, then we may have additional material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting during the time we integrate their financial reporting processes with our financial reporting processes.

 PROMISSORY
 NOTE 

12,275,000.00 
 NOVEMBER 12, 2020 

FOR
 VALUE RECEIVED , MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC, a Texas limited liability company Debtor ),
 unconditionally promises to pay to the order of B1BANK , a Louisiana banking corporation (together with its successors and
 assigns, Lender ), without setoff, at its offices at 5220 Spring Valley Road, Suite 100, Dallas (Dallas
 County), TX 75254, or at such other place as may be designated in writing by Lender, the principal amount of TWELVE MILLION
 TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND AND NO100 DOLLARS 12,275,000.00) , or so much thereof as may be advanced from time to time
 in immediately available funds, together with interest computed daily on the outstanding principal balance hereunder, at an annual
 interest rate (the Rate ), and in accordance with the payment schedule indicated below. This PROMISSORY
 NOTE (this Note is executed pursuant to and evidences the Loan funded by Lender under, and secured
 in part by, that certain LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT dated as of even date herewith (the Effective Date ),
 between Debtor, White Claw, Grantor and Lender (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the Loan
 Agreement ), to which reference is made for a statement of the collateral, rights and obligations of Debtor and Lender
 in relation thereto, but neither this reference to the Loan Agreement, nor any provision thereof shall affect or impair the absolute
 and unconditional obligation of Debtor to pay unpaid principal of and interest on this Note when due. Capitalized terms not otherwise
 defined herein shall have the same meanings as in the Loan Agreement. 
 
 1. Rate .
 Prior to the Maturity Date or an Event of Default, the Rate shall be the LESSER of (a) the MAXIMUM RATE , or
 (b) the LIBOR RATE plus THREE PERCENT (3.00 (the Rate Margin ). From and
 after the Maturity Date, the Rate shall be the Maturity Rate. As used herein, the term LIBOR Rate shall
 mean, on any applicable date of determination, the London Interbank Offered Rate of interest per annum as published on that date
 on the website of http://online.wsj.com/public/us as the current Libor 1 Month Rate . On days when http://online.wsj.com/public/us
 does not publish the current Libor 1 Month Rate, the LIBOR Rate will be the most recently published Libor 1 Month Rate on http://online.wsj.com/public/us . In
 the event http://online.wsj.com/public/us shall cease to exist or shall cease to publish a current Libor 1 Month Rate, then
 the LIBOR Rate will be the 1 Month London Interbank Offered Rate of interest per annum as quoted from ICE Benchmark Administration
 Limited Interest Settlement Rates, or any successor thereto or replacement thereof; provided that if no such successor or replacement
 shall exist at such time, the LIBOR Rate shall be determined by any other source selected by Lender in its Permitted Discretion
 that reflects an alternative index rate designated by Lender from time to time, as quoted for U.S. Dollars. Commencing on the Effective
 Date and continuing through the Maturity Date, the LIBOR Rate shall be determined on the FIRST (1 st day of each
 calendar month and shall be fixed for such calendar month. In the event the Effective Date is a date other than the FIRST (1 st day of a calendar month, then the LIBOR Rate in effect from the Effective Date until the day immediately prior to the FIRST
 (1 st day of the next succeeding calendar month shall be the LIBOR Rate in effect as of the Effective Date. Any
 change in the Rate resulting from an adjustment of the LIBOR Rate on the FIRST (1 st day of each calendar month
 or any change in the Maximum Rate in effect from day to day shall be effective without notice to Debtor (which notice of change
 in the applicable Rate is hereby expressly waived by Debtor) on the same date as the change in the Rate. 
 
 (a) If
 Lender notifies Debtor that rates obtained by Lender in or through the London interbank market do not adequately reflect Lender s
 own funding costs, then Lender may substitute another rate based on an index chosen by Lender in its Permitted Discretion which
 index used to determine such rate shall be consistent with the index used by Lender in determining rates for its other similarly
 situated borrowers and add the Rate Margin to that, and Debtor will pay interest at a rate per year equal to the sum of such index
 rate plus the Rate Margin. The provisions of this Section shall apply to any such substituted total rate based on any such index,
 as fully as if such total rate were the LIBOR Rate. 

PROMISSORY NOTE PAGE 1 
B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

(b) If
 any treaty, statute, regulation, interpretation thereof, or any directive, guideline, or otherwise by a central bank or fiscal
 authority (whether or not having the force of law) shall either prohibit or extend the time at which any principal subject to the
 LIBOR Rate, or corresponding deposits, may be purchased, maintained, or repaid, all as determined by Lender in its Permitted
 Discretion, then Lender may substitute another index rate chosen by Lender in its Permitted Discretion which index used to determine
 such rate shall be consistent with the index used by Lender in determining rates for its other similarly situated borrowers and add
 the Rate Margin to that, and Debtor will pay interest at a rate per year equal to the sum of such index rate plus the Rate Margin.
 The provisions of this Section shall apply to any such substituted total rate based on any such index, as fully as if such total
 rate were the LIBOR Rate. 
 
 (c) All
 payments of principal and interest shall be made without reduction for any taxes (other than income or withholding taxes imposed
 by the United States or any State thereof on payments hereunder or imposed by any taxing jurisdiction on the income of Lender),
 costs, fees, losses and expenses incurred or charged by Lender resulting from having principal outstanding hereunder at the LIBOR
 Rate, including: 
 
 (i) Taxes
 (or the withholding of amounts for taxes) of any nature whatsoever including income, excise, and interest equalization taxes (other
 than income or withholding taxes imposed by the United States or any State thereof on payments hereunder or imposed by any taxing
 jurisdiction on the income of Lender), as well as all levies, imposts, duties, or fees whether now in existence or resulting from
 a change in, or promulgation of, any treaty, statute, regulation, interpretation thereof, or any directive, guideline, or otherwise,
 by a central bank or fiscal authority (whether or not having the force of law) or a change in the basis of, or time of payment
 of, such taxes and other amounts resulting therefrom; 
 
 (ii) To
 the extent not included within the definition of LIBOR Rate, any reserve or special deposit requirements against assets or liabilities
 of, or deposits with or for the account of, Lender with respect to principal outstanding at the LIBOR Rate (including those imposed
 under Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board) or resulting from a change in, or the promulgation of, such requirements by treaty,
 statute, regulation, interpretation thereof, or any directive, guideline, or otherwise by a central bank or fiscal authority (whether
 or not having the force of law); and 
 
 (iii) Any
 other costs resulting from compliance with treaties, statutes, regulations, interpretations, or any directives or guidelines, or
 otherwise by a central bank or fiscal authority (whether or not having the force of law). 
 
 Notwithstanding
 any provision of this Note or any other agreement or commitment between Debtor and Lender, whether written or oral, express or
 implied, Lender shall never be entitled to charge, receive or collect, nor shall amounts received hereunder be credited so that
 Lender shall be paid, as interest a sum greater than interest at the Maximum Rate. It is the intention of Lender and Debtor that
 this Note, and all instruments securing the payment of this Note or executed or delivered in connection therewith, shall comply
 with applicable law. If Lender ever contracts for, charges, receives or collects anything of value which is deemed to be interest
 under applicable law, and if the occurrence of any circumstance or contingency, whether acceleration of maturity of this Note,
 prepayment of this Note, delay in advancing proceeds of this Note or any other event, should cause such interest to exceed the
 Maximum Rate, any amount which exceeds interest at the Maximum Rate shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance
 of this Note or any other Indebtedness, and if this Note and such other Indebtedness are paid in full, any remaining excess shall
 be paid to Debtor. In determining whether the interest exceeds interest at the Maximum Rate, the total amount of interest shall
 be spread, prorated and amortized throughout the entire term of this Note until its payment in full. The term Maximum Rate 
 as used in this Note means the maximum nonusurious rate of interest per annum permitted by whichever of applicable United States
 federal law or Texas law permits the higher interest rate, including to the extent permitted by applicable law, any amendments
 thereof hereafter or any new law hereafter coming into effect to the extent a higher Maximum Rate is permitted thereby. If at any
 time the Rate shall exceed the Maximum Rate, the Rate shall be automatically limited to the Maximum Rate until the total amount
 of interest accrued hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have accrued if there had been no limitation to the Maximum
 Rate. To the extent, if any, that Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code, as amended (the Act ), is relevant to Lender
 for purposes of determining the Maximum Rate, Lender and Debtor elect to determine the Maximum Rate under the Act pursuant to the
 weekly ceiling from time to time in effect, as referred to and defined in 303.001-303.016 of the Act; subject, however,
 to any right Lender subsequently may have under applicable law to change the method of determining the Maximum Rate. 

PROMISSORY NOTE PAGE 2 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

2. Accrual
 Method . Interest on the Indebtedness evidenced by this Note shall be computed on the basis of a THREE HUNDRED SIXTY
 (360) day year and shall accrue on the actual number of days elapsed for any whole or partial month in which interest is being
 calculated. In computing the number of days during which interest accrues, the day on which funds are initially advanced shall
 be included regardless of the time of day such advance is made, and the day on which funds are repaid shall be included unless
 repayment is credited prior to the close of business on the Business Day received as provided herein. 
 
 3. Payment
 Schedule . Except as expressly provided herein to the contrary, all payments on this Note shall be applied in the following
 order of priority: (a) the payment of accrued but unpaid interest hereon, (b) the payment of all or any portion of the principal
 balance hereof then outstanding hereunder, in the direct order of maturity, and (c) the payment or reimbursement of any expenses,
 costs or obligations (other than the outstanding principal balance hereof and interest hereon) for which either Debtor shall be
 obligated or Lender shall be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Note or the other Loan Documents,. If an Event of Default
 exists, then Lender may, at the sole option of Lender, apply any such payments, at any time and from time to time, to any of the
 items specified in clauses (a), (b) or (c) above without regard to the order of priority otherwise specified herein and any
 application to the outstanding principal balance hereof may be made in either direct or inverse order of maturity. If any payment of
 principal or interest on this Note shall become due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
 succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such

7. Remedies
 Upon Default . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default the entire balance outstanding hereunder and all other obligations

 of this Note shall be increased at Lender s discretion up to the LESSER of (i) EIGHTEEN PERCENT (18.00 ,
 or (ii) the MAXIMUM RATE (the Maturity Rate ). The provisions herein for a Maturity Rate (a) shall not be
 deemed to extend the time for any payment hereunder or to constitute a grace period giving Obligors a right to cure any default,
 and (b) shall be deemed the contract rate of interest applicable to the outstanding principal balance of the Note after the occurrence
 and during the continuance of one of the events set forth in this Section. At Lender s option, any accrued and unpaid interest,
 fees or charges may, for purposes of computing and accruing interest on a daily basis after the due date of this Note or any installment

 an Event of Default, Lender is hereby authorized at any time, at its option and without notice or demand, to set off and charge
 against any deposit accounts of any Obligor (as well as any money, instruments, securities, documents, chattel paper, credits,
 claims, demands, income and any other property, rights and interests of any Obligor), which at any time shall come into the possession
 or custody or under the control of Lender or any of its agents, affiliates or correspondents, any and all obligations due hereunder.
 Additionally, Lender shall have all rights and remedies available under each of the Loan Documents, as well as all rights and remedies
 available at law or in equity. 
 
 8. Waiver .
 The failure at any time of Lender to exercise any of its options or any other rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver thereof,
 nor shall it be a bar to the exercise of any of its options or rights at a later date. All rights and remedies of Lender shall
 be cumulative and may be pursued singly, successively or together, at the option of Lender. The acceptance by Lender of any partial
 payment shall not constitute a waiver of any default or of any of Lender s rights under this Note. No waiver of any of its
 rights hereunder, and no modification or amendment of this Note, shall be deemed to be made by Lender unless the same shall be
 in writing, duly signed on behalf of Lender; each such waiver shall apply only with respect to the specific instance involved,
 and shall in no way impair the rights of Lender or the obligations of Obligors to Lender in any other respect at any other time . 
 
 9. Applicable
 Law . Debtor agrees that this Note shall be deemed to have been made in the State of Texas at Lender s address indicated
 at the beginning of this Note and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas and is
 performable in the City and County of Texas indicated at the beginning of this Note. 
 
 10. Partial
 Invalidity . The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Note shall not affect the enforceability or validity
 of any other provision herein and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Note or of the Loan Documents to
 any person or circumstance shall not affect the enforceability or validity of such provision as it may apply to other persons or
 circumstances. 
 
 11. Binding
 Effect . This Note shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Obligors and Lender and their respective successors,
 assigns, heirs and personal representatives, provided, however, that no obligations of Obligors hereunder can be assigned without
 prior written consent of Lender. 
 
 12. Controlling
 Document . To the extent that this Note conflicts with or is in any way incompatible with any other document related specifically
 to the loan evidenced by this Note, this Note shall control over any other such document, and if this Note does not address an
 issue, then each other such document shall control to the extent that it deals most specifically with an issue. 
 
 13. Commercial
 Purpose . DEBTOR REPRESENTS TO LENDER THAT THE PROCEEDS OF THIS LOAN ARE TO BE USED PRIMARILY FOR BUSINESS, COMMERCIAL OR AGRICULTURAL
 PURPOSES AND NOT FOR PERSONAL, FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES. DEBTOR ACKNOWLEDGES HAVING READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREES TO BE BOUND

 If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, or if it is collected through any legal proceeding at law or
 in equity or in bankruptcy, receivership or other court proceedings, Debtor agrees to pay all costs of collection, including, but
 not limited to, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees. 
 
 15. Time
 is of the Essence . Time is of the essence with respect to all provisions of this Note and the other Loan Documents. 
 
 16. Notice
 of Balloon Payment . At maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), Debtor must repay the entire principal balance
 of this Note and unpaid interest then due. Lender is under no obligation to refinance the outstanding principal balance of this
 Note (if any) at that time. Debtor will, therefore, be required to make payment out of other assets Debtor may own; or Debtor will
 have to find a lender willing to lend Debtor the money at prevailing market rates, which may be higher than the interest rate on
 the outstanding principal balance of this Note. If Obligors have guaranteed payment of this Note, Obligors may be required to perform
 under such guaranty. 
 
 17. Waiver
 of Jury Trial . TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OBLIGOR AND LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY
 WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF LENDER IN THE
 NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH OBLIGOR (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
 OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
 THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT DEBTOR HAS BEEN INDUCED TO EXECUTE THIS NOTE AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG
 OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 

NOTICE
 OF FINAL AGREEMENT 
 
 THIS
 NOTE AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE SAME MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE
 OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE
 PARTIES.

against or sought to be collected from any indemnified party by a third party (a Third Party Claim ),
such indemnified party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days following such indemnified party s receipt of a
Third Party Claim, notify the indemnifying party in writing of such Third Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of Loss
sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party
Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other
material details pertaining thereto (a Claim Notice ); provided, however , that the failure to
timely give a Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an indemnified party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a
material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the indemnifying party with respect to such Third Party
Claim. The indemnifying party shall have ten (10) days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be
required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the Notice
Period to notify the indemnified party that it desires to defend the indemnified party against such Third Party
Claim. No Claim or Loss, and no Claim Notice, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, may be made or asserted by any Party
subsequent to the expiration of one (1) year after the Closing Date, except for a Claim or Loss arising out of a Fundamental
Representation or a Fraud Claim. 

(b) In the event that the indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the indemnified party against a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall have the right to defend the indemnified party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, at its expense. Once the indemnifying party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The indemnified party shall participate in any such defense at its expense unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party are both named parties to the proceedings and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential material differing interests between them, (ii) the indemnified party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the indemnifying party has failed to diligently pursue a Third Party Claim it has assumed as provided above, (iii) the Third Party Claim involves a criminal suit, or (iv) the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable relief, then in each such case the indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of one separate counsel (in addition to any reasonably necessary local counsel). The indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim. 

37 

(c) If the indemnifying party (i) elects not to defend the indemnified party against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the indemnified party timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, and (ii) after assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15) days after receiving written notice from the indemnified party to the effect that the indemnifying party has so failed, the indemnified party shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense, it being understood that the indemnified party s right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. 

(d) Promptly after an indemnified party comes to believe it has a claim for indemnification hereunder for a Claim or Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a Direct Claim ), the indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of such Direct Claim and specify in such notice the basis for such Direct Claim setting forth the nature of the Claim and, to the extent known, the amount thereof in reasonable detail. Any failure of an indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party of liability hereunder except to the extent that the defense of such Direct Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. 

(e) All payments made by an indemnifying party to an indemnified party in respect of any Claims and Losses pursuant to this Article X shall be treated as adjustments to the consideration paid pursuant to the Transactions for Tax purposes. 

(f) To the extent the indemnification procedures of this Section 10.4 are in conflict with the provisions of Section 6.3 , the provisions of Section 6.3 shall control. 

(g) The Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all Third Party Claims for any breach of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Section. 

10.5. Mitigation and Subsequent Recoveries. 

(a) Each indemnified party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate all Claims and Losses of such indemnified party hereunder, including using commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself of any defenses, limitations, rights of contribution, claims against third parties and other rights at law or equity, and shall provide such evidence and documentation of the nature and extent of the claim as may be reasonably requested by the indemnifying party. 

(b) If the amount of any indemnified party s Loss, at any time subsequent to an indemnifying party s making of a payment under this Article X , is reduced by actual recovery, settlement, or otherwise under or pursuant to any applicable insurance coverage (net of any deductible), or pursuant to any applicable actual recovery, settlement, or payment by or against any other Person, without duplication of any amount already reducing such Loss (collectively, Recoveries ), the amount of such Recoveries shall be repaid by such indemnified party to such indemnifying party within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof (or credit therefor) by such indemnified party, up to the aggregate amount of the payments made by such indemnifying party to such indemnified party. 

38 

10.6. Access to Information . 

(a) After
the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall grant to each other (or their respective designees), reasonable access at reasonable
times to the Records (relating to pre-Closing periods) in its possession, and shall afford each such Person the right (at such
Person s expense) to make copies thereof to the extent reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of or to investigate
or defend any Claims among the Parties and/or their Affiliates arising under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser shall grant to Seller (and its respective designees) each of the foregoing access rights to the extent such pre-Closing
Records are necessary to Seller in connection with any investigation or audit by a Governmental Authority or any Claim or dispute by
or with any Person other than Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain such Records.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a dispute between the Parties, the furnishing of, or access to, the
Records shall be subject to applicable rules relating to discovery and Seller and its Affiliates shall have no right of access to,

jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine protections available to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, (y)
cause Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to breach a third-party Contract, or (z) result in a violation of Law. 

(b) Seller and its Affiliates may retain a copy of all Data Room materials and all Records prepared in connection with the Assets; provided that Seller shall ensure that all original copies from which duplicates are obtained by Seller are retained by Purchaser following Closing.

(a) Subject to Article X , the Parties acknowledge and agree that, from and after Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all Claims (other than Claims arising from the Purchaser Leases or Fraud on the part of a party hereto in connection with the Transactions) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement (excluding the Purchaser Leases), shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X . In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, Claims and Losses for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement (excluding the Purchaser Leases) it may have against the other Parties and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Laws, or the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X . 

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledge that, subject to any rights they may have hereunder to seek and obtain specific performance or other express injunctive remedies, following the Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the Transactions.

7.3. Specific Performance . Endeavor acknowledges that Pilot would be damaged irreparably if the obligations of Endeavor, as applicable, under this Agreement to be performed hereunder or in connection herewith are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breached.

Endeavor agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. Endeavor further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that such specific enforcement is unavailable because a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. 

7.4. Liquidated Damages . In addition to the rights afforded by Section 7.3 , Endeavor understands that Pilot will also suffer irrevocable and unrecoverable damages should Endeavor fail to direct and haul loads of Produced Water to the Priority Wells, including disposal revenue and revenue relating to recovered skim oil.

Endeavor waives, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any and all defenses as to the validity of the Liquidated Damages on grounds that they are void as penalties, are inaccurate, or are an insufficient approximation of the actual damages suffered by Pilot, and agrees not to claim or maintain any claim to the contrary.

If and to the extent an assignment of any Receivable is ineffective or unable to be made, Assignor shall hold in trust the Receivable and grants to Assignee full rights of subrogation with respect to each such Receivable, and authorizes Assignee to collect on Assignor s behalf such Receivable from the debtor thereof. Assignee hereby ACCEPTS and ASSUMES the Receivables, and all rights and benefits thereof, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances other than restrictions imposed under applicable law. 

2. Bank Accounts; Cooperation .

The rights of Assignor under this Section 3 shall be additional to and shall not prejudice any other or additional rights and remedies afforded to Assignor by law, and shall be without prejudice to Assignor s right to take legal action with respect thereto, including the right to dispute any collection, invoice, or Receivable as a result of such audit. In the event that a computational, invoicing, accounting, or other monetary error is discovered pursuant to this Section 3 , then the parties hereto shall remedy such error, and the party owing payment shall pay the other the amount concerned within thirty (30) days of the error being substantiated. 

4. Standard of Conduct . In the performance of its obligations hereunder, Assignor shall act in good faith and fair dealing, and use best efforts to assist Assignee in collection of the Receivables. 

5. Events of Default; Remedies . An Event of Default shall mean the failure of either party hereto to materially comply with any material provision of this Assignment if such failure is not cured within three (3) business days after notice thereof from the other party hereto. If an Event of Default occurs with respect to either party to this Assignment, the other party hereto may exercise any and all remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract, unless and to the extent expressly limited herein. Assignor acknowledges that Assignee may be irreparably harmed by Assignor s breach or default of this Agreement, and that the payment of money may be an insufficient remedy to make Assignee whole, and agrees and authorizes Assignee to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief in order to prevent breaches or defaults of this Agreement by Assignor. Assignor covenants not to oppose the granting of such equitable relief, including on the basis that Assignor has an adequate remedy at law or in damages or that specific performance is not an appropriate remedy. 

6. Limitation . NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN, THE DELIVERY OF THIS ASSIGNMENT SHALL NOT DIMINISH OR OTHERWISE IMPAIR ANY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, INDEMNITIES, TERMS OR PROVISIONS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND ALL OF THE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, INDEMNITIES, TERMS AND PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT SHALL SURVIVE THE DELIVERY OF THIS ASSIGNMENT TO THE EXTENT, AND IN THE MANNER, SET FORTH IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.

All Equipment repairs and maintenance shall be performed at facilities designated or approved by Secured Party and in compliance with the Preventative Maintenance Schedule set forth in Section 3.8 above. As proof of compliance, Obligor shall supply Secured Party with all requested invoices, maintenance records, purchase orders and similar documents evidencing compliance with maintenance procedures.

(c) Modifications to Equipment . Obligor shall make no addition, improvement, or modification to the Equipment unless Secured Party gives Obligor written permission in advance.

coverages solely from insurance carriers that are rated at least A- by A.M. Best (or of equivalent financial strength in the

all insurance coverages required above have been procured from insurance carriers rated at least A- by A.M. Best (or of equivalent
financial strength in the commercially-reasonable judgment of Secured Party), that the coverages are being properly maintained, and
that the premiums thereof are paid. Each insurance certificate shall specify the name of the insurance carrier, the policy number,
and the expiration date, and list Secured Party as the primary loss payee, and as an additional insured with primary coverage. If a
certificate of insurance provided to Obligor under this Section does not show that written notice of cancellation, or modification
of the policy shall be given to Secured Party at least thirty (30) days prior to such cancellation or modification, Obligor shall
provide or cause its insurance carrier to provide, this notice to Secured Party.

contained in this Agreement. 

4.2 Disclaimer
of Warranties . SECURED PARTY, NOT BEING THE MANUFACTURER OR THE VENDOR OF THE EQUIPMENT, HEREBY MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND OR AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE DESIGN OR CONDITION OF THE EQUIPMENT, ITS
MERCHANTABILITY OR ITS FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE, OR ITS CAPACITY OR DURABILITY, OR THE QUALITY OF THE MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP OR CONFORMITY
OF THE EQUIPMENT TO THE PROVISIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS OF ANY PURCHASE ORDER RELATING THERETO, OR ANY PATENT INFRINGMENT OR PATENT OR
LATENT DEFECTS, AND OBLIGOR HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER BY SECURED PARTY. 

ARTICLE V 

 Secured Party s
Rights 

5.1 Secured
Party s Rights . Secured Party shall have the following rights at all times without regard to the occurrence of an Event
of Default: 

(a) Assertion of Warranties . Provided no Event of Default has occurred or is continuing hereunder, and so long as the Equipment is subject to this Agreement and Secured Party is legally permitted so to do, Obligor hereby authorizes Secured Party to assert for Obligor s account, all rights of Obligor under any manufacturer s, vendor s or dealer s warranty on the Equipment. 

(b) Information. Secured Party may at any time obtain from any party any information concerning the Collateral, and neither Secured Party nor the person furnishing such information shall be liable to Obligor in respect thereof. 

Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Collateral Page 13 of 22 

(c) Performance
by Secured Party. Secured Party may, but is not obligated to, perform or attempt to perform any covenant or agreement of Obligor
contained herein. If all or any material portion of the Collateral becomes the subject of any proceeding and Obligor fails to defend
fully such proceeding and to protect Obligor s and Secured Party s rights in such Collateral in good faith, Secured
Party may, at its option but at Obligor s cost, elect to defend and control the defense of such litigation or other
proceeding, and may (i) select and retain counsel, (ii) determine whether settlement shall be offered or accepted, and (iii)
determine and negotiate all settlement terms. Secured Party is not required to fulfill any of the obligations of Obligor with
respect to any of the Collateral, or to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment
received by it or the sufficiency of any performance of any party under any of the Collateral, or to present or file any claim, or
to take any action to enforce any performance or the payment of any amounts which have been assigned to it, in which it has been
granted a security interest, or to which it may be entitled at any time. 

(d) Preservation
of Collateral. Obligor has the risk of loss of the Collateral. Secured Party s duty with respect to any Collateral in the
possession of Secured Party is solely to use reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral. Secured Party shall
be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if it takes such
action for that purpose as Obligor may request in writing, but failure by Secured Party to comply with any such request shall not of
itself be deemed a failure to exercise such reasonable care. SECURED PARTY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, NOR SHALL THE OBLIGATIONS
(OR OBLIGOR S LIABILITY WITH RESPECT THERETO) BE SUBJECT TO SETOFF OR REDUCTION BY REASON OF, ANY SHORTAGE, DISCREPANCY,
DAMAGE, LOSS, OR DESTRUCTION IN OR TO THE COLLATERAL UNLESS CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SECURED PARTY
NOR, IN ANY EVENT, ANY DEPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. In the event of any motor vehicle accident, or damage to, loss,
or destruction of any part or parcel of the Collateral, in total or in part, Secured Party has the senior priority right, but not
the obligation, to elect to receive the proceeds of any all insurance policies, claims, disbursements, reimbursements, and monies of
any kind. Secured Party has no duty to maintain in force, to prevent lapse or impairment of, or to exercise any rights with respect
to any of the Collateral or any insurance thereon, or to exercise any rights, options or privileges respecting any of the Collateral
or to take any steps necessary to preserve rights against prior or other parties or to enforce collection of the Collateral or any
part thereof by legal proceedings or otherwise. The duties of Obligor are to account to Secured Party for Collateral actually
received by Secured Party and to receive collections, remittances and payments on such Collateral as and when made and received by
Obligor and hold same as Collateral or apply same to the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof. 

(e) Assignment .
This Agreement and/or any other part of the Loan Documents may be assigned, in whole or in part, by Secured Party without notice to
Obligor, and Obligor agrees not to assert against any such assignee, or assignee s assigns, any defense, set-off, recoupment
claim or counterclaim which Obligor has or may at any time have against Secured Party for any reason whatsoever. Obligor agrees that
if Obligor receives written notice of an assignment from Secured Party, Obligor will continue to perform the Obligations to such
assignees as so instructed by Secured Party or their assigns. Obligor agrees to confirm in writing receipt of the notice of
assignment as may be reasonably requested by Secured Party or their assigns. 

Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Collateral Page 14 of 22 

(f) Inspection of Collateral . Secured Party shall have the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to demand an accounting and inspection of the Collateral during normal business hours after giving reasonable prior notice to Obligor. 

(g) Defense of Claims. Obligor shall promptly notify Secured Party in writing of the commencement of any legal proceedings affecting Obligor s title to the Collateral or Secured Party s Lien or security interest in the Collateral, or any part thereof, and shall take such action, employing attorneys agreeable to Secured Party, as may be necessary to preserve Obligor s or Secured Party s rights affected thereby. If Obligor fails or refuses to adequately or vigorously, in the sole judgment of Secured Party, defend Obligor s or Secured Party s rights to the Collateral, Secured Party may take such action on behalf of and in the name of Obligor and at Obligor s expense. Moreover, Secured Party may take such independent action in connection therewith as they may in their discretion deem proper, including the right to employ independent counsel and to intervene in any suit affecting the Collateral. All costs, expenses and attorneys fees incurred by Secured Party pursuant to this Section 5.1 or in connection with the defense by Secured Party of any claims, demands or litigation relating to Obligor, the Collateral or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall be paid by Obligor on demand plus interest thereon from the date of the advance by Secured Party until reimbursement of Secured Party at the Default Rate.

Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Collateral Page 17 of 22 

ARTICLE VII 

 Secured Party s
Remedies Upon Default 

7.1 Possession
and Sale of Collateral . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, and in addition to all other rights
of Secured Party, Secured Party shall have the following rights and powers, but not the obligation: 

(a) to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Obligor, without prejudice to any other remedies hereunder; 

(b) to cause Obligor, at Obligor s expense, to promptly assemble the Equipment, Rigging Equipment, and the Personalty Collateral or any item thereof and return the same to Secured Party at such place as Secured Party may designate in writing; 

(c) to peaceably seize and possess all Collateral, including the Equipment, the Rigging Equipment, and the Personalty Collateral, including entering upon the premises where the Equipment is located, and, without notice to Obligor, and with or without process, take immediate possession of the Equipment, or render the Equipment unusable or immobile, without liability to Obligor by reason of such entry or taking possession, and without such action constituting a termination of this Agreement unless Secured Party notifies Obligor to such effect; 

(d) to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the Equipment, the Rigging Equipment, and the Personalty Collateral in a public or private sale or lease transaction, and apply the proceeds of such sale or leasing, after first deducting all costs and expenses of such sale or leasing, to Obligor s Obligations hereunder, with Obligor remaining liable for any deficiency and with any excess being retained by Secured Party, and proceed by court action to enforce performance by Obligor of the applicable covenants of this Agreement or to recover damages for the breach thereof. In addition to the foregoing, Obligor shall be obligated hereunder for the payment of all other amounts then or thereafter payable by Obligor to Secured Party hereunder, including without limitation, amounts owing for indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing: 

(i) The purchaser of any Collateral sold shall thereafter hold title
to the same free from any claim or right, including any equity of redemption, of Obligor. Secured Party may make any such sale subject
to any limitation or restriction, including but not limited to a limitation in the method of offering the Collateral or in the number
or identity of prospective bidders, which Secured Party may believe to be necessary to comply with any requirement of applicable law
or in order to obtain any required approval of the purchase or the purchaser by any governmental authority or officer. No such limitation
or restriction shall cause such sale not to be considered a commercially reasonable sale, nor shall Secured Party be liable or accountable
to Obligor, nor shall the Obligations be subject to any reduction, by reason of the fact that the proceeds of a sale subject to any such
limitation or restriction are less than otherwise might have been obtained. Without notice to or consent by Obligor, Secured Party may
exercise all rights as the insured, beneficiary, or owner of any insurance policy and may surrender same and receive the surrender value
thereof or sell same pursuant to the terms thereof. 

Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Collateral Page 18 of 22 

(ii) Secured Party shall give Obligor commercially reasonable notice
of the time and place of any public sale thereof or of the time after which any private sale or any other intended disposition thereof
is to be made. The requirements of commercially reasonable notice are met if such notice is given in accordance with this Agreement at
least ten (10) days before the time of the sale or disposition. All expenses of seizing, possessing, retaking, holding, preparing for
sale, selling, leasing or the like, including Secured Party s attorneys fees and legal expenses, shall be borne by Obligor.
Public or private sales, for cash or on credit, to a wholesaler or retailer or investor, or use of Collateral of the types subject to
this Agreement, or public auction, are hereby deemed by Obligor to be commercially reasonable because differences in the sales prices
generally realized in the different kinds of sales are ordinarily offset by the differences in the costs and the credit risks of such
sales. 

(iii) At any sale Secured Party may sell any part of the Collateral
without warranty of any kind and may specifically disclaim any warranty of title or the like, and none of the foregoing will be considered
to make the sale not commercially reasonable. 

ARTICLE VIII

waiver thereof, nor shall one exercise of any right affect or impair the exercise of any other right.

(c) Each
right, power and remedy of the Secured Party provided for in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the

existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Secured Party
of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Secured Party to exercise any such right,
power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Secured Party to
any other further action in any circumstances without demand or notice. The Secured Party shall have the full power to enforce or to
assign or contract its rights under this Agreement to a third party.

This Agreement is additional and supplemental to any and all other guarantees, security agreements or collateral heretofore and hereafter executed by the Pledgor and the Company for the benefit of the Secured Party, whether relating to the indebtedness evidenced by the Note or not, and shall not supersede or be superseded by any other document or guaranty executed by the Pledgor, the Company or any other Person for any purpose. The Pledgor and the Company hereby agree that the Pledgor, the Company, and any other Persons that may become liable for repayment of the sums due under the Note, may hereafter be released from their liability hereunder and thereunder; and the Secured Party may take, or delay in taking or refuse to take, any and all action with reference to the Note (regardless of whether same might vary the risk or alter the rights, remedies or recourses of the Pledgor), including specifically the settlement or compromise of any amount allegedly due thereunder, all without notice to, consideration to or the consent of the Pledgor, and without in any way releasing, diminishing or affecting in any way the absolute nature of the Pledgor s obligations and liabilities hereunder.

delay on the part of the Secured Party in exercising any rights hereunder or failure to exercise the same shall operate as a waiver
of such rights. The Pledgor and the Company hereby waives any and all legal requirements, statutory or otherwise, that the Secured

Pledgor, the Company or any other Person with respect to the Note, as a condition precedent to bringing an action against the
Pledgor or the Company upon this Agreement or as a condition precedent to the exercise of the Secured Party s rights under Section 10(a) .
The Pledgor and the Company agree that the Secured Party may simultaneously maintain an action upon this Agreement and an action or
proceeding upon the Note. Until the earlier to occur of (i) the indefeasible payment in full of all of the Obligations, (ii) the
termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or (iii) following the occurrence and continuance of an
Event of Default hereunder or under the Note and the exercise by the Secured Party of its right to effect a transfer of the
Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof, the execution and/or delivery of the Pledged Materials by the Pledgor to the Secured Party
in accordance with this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the Pledgor shall not be released by any act or thing that might, but
for this provision of this Agreement, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge of a surety, or by reason of any waiver, extension,
modification, forbearance or delay of the Secured Party or any obligation or agreement between the Company or their successors or
assigns, and the then holder of the Note, relating to the payment of any sums evidenced or secured thereby or to any of the other
terms, covenants and conditions contained therein, and the Pledgor hereby expressly waives and surrenders any defense to liability
hereunder based upon any of the foregoing acts, things, agreements or waivers, or any of them. The Pledgor and the Company also
waive any defense arising by virtue of any disability, insolvency, bankruptcy, lack of authority or power or dissolution of the
Pledgor or the Company, even though rendering the Note void, unenforceable or otherwise uncollectible, it being agreed that the
Pledgor and the Company shall remain liable hereunder, regardless of any claim that the Pledgor or the Company might otherwise have
against the Secured Party by virtue of the Secured Party s invocation of any right, remedy or recourse given to it hereunder
or under the Note. In addition, until the earlier to occur of (A) the indefeasible payment in full of all of the Obligations, (B)
the termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or (C) following the occurrence of an Event of Default
hereunder or under the Note and the exercise by the Secured Party of its right to effect a transfer of the Collateral pursuant to
the terms hereof, the execution and/or delivery of the Pledged Materials by the Pledgor to the Secured Party in accordance with this
Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the Pledgor waives and renounces any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity
whatsoever, and any right of recourse to security for the Obligations of the Company to the Secured Party.

power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other

any other further action in any circumstances without demand or notice. The Secured Party shall have the full power to enforce or to
assign or contract its rights under this Agreement to a third party.

modification, forbearance or delay of the Secured Party or any obligation or agreement between the Company or their successors or
assigns, and the then holder of the Note, relating to the payment of any sums evidenced or secured thereby or to any of the other

(a) Assertion of Warranties.

Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Collateral-Page 14 of 23 

(c) Performance by Secured Party. Secured Party may, but is not obligated to, perform or attempt to perform any covenant or agreement of Obligor contained herein. If all or any material portion of the Collateral becomes the subject of any proceeding and Obligor fails to defend fully such proceeding and to protect Obligor s and Secured Party s rights in such Collateral in good faith, Secured Party may, at its option but at Obligor s cost, elect to defend and control the defense of such litigation or other proceeding, and may (i) select and retain counsel, (ii) determine whether settlement shall be offered or accepted, and (iii) determine and negotiate all settlement terms. Secured Party is not required to fulfill any of the obligations of Obligor with respect to any of the Collateral, or to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by it or the sufficiency of any performance of any party under any of the Collateral, or to present or file any claim, or to take any action to enforce any performance or the payment of any amounts which have been assigned to it, in which it has been granted a security interest, or to which it may be entitled at any time. 

(d) Preservation of Collateral. Obligor has the risk of loss of the Collateral. Secured Party s duty with respect to any Collateral in the possession of Secured Party is solely to use reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral. Secured Party shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if it takes such action for that purpose as Obligor may request in writing, but failure by Secured Party to comply with any such request shall not of itself be deemed a failure to exercise such reasonable care. SECURED PARTY SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, NOR SHALL THE OBLIGATIONS (OR OBLIGOR S LIABILITY WITH RESPECT THERETO) BE SUBJECT TO SETOFF OR REDUCTION BY REASON OF, ANY SHORTAGE, DISCREPANCY, DAMAGE, LOSS, OR DESTRUCTION IN OR TO THE COLLATERAL UNLESS CAUSED BY THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SECURED PARTY NOR, IN ANY EVENT, ANY DEPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. In the event of any motor vehicle accident, or damage to, loss, or destruction of any part or parcel of the Collateral, in total or in part, Secured Party has the senior priority right, but not the obligation, to elect to receive the proceeds of any all insurance policies, claims, disbursements, reimbursements, and monies of any kind.. Secured Party has no duty to maintain in force, to prevent lapse or impairment of, or to exercise any rights with respect to any of the Collateral or any insurance thereon, or to exercise any rights, options or privileges respecting any of the Collateral or to take any steps necessary to preserve rights against prior or other parties or to enforce collection of the Collateral or any part thereof by legal proceedings or otherwise. The duties of Obligor are to account to Secured Party for Collateral actually received by Secured Party and to receive collections, remittances and payments on such Collateral as and when made and received by Obligor and hold same as Collateral or apply same to the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof. 

(e) Assignment. This Agreement and/or any other part of the Loan Documents may be assigned, in whole or in part, by Secured Party without notice to Obligor, and Obligor agrees not to assert against any such assignee, or assignee s assigns, any defense, set-off, recoupment claim or counterclaim which Obligor has or may at any time have against Secured Party for any reason whatsoever. Obligor agrees that if Obligor receives written notice of an assignment from Secured Party, Obligor will continue to perform the Obligations to such assignees as so instructed by Secured Party or their assigns. Obligor agrees to confirm in writing receipt of the notice of assignment as may be reasonably requested by Secured Party or their assigns. 

Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Collateral-Page 15 of 23 

(f) Inspection of Collateral. Secured Party shall have the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to demand an accounting and inspection of the Collateral during normal business hours after giving reasonable prior notice to Obligor. 

(g) Defense of Claims. Obligor shall promptly notify Secured Party in writing of the commencement of any legal proceedings affecting Obligor s title to the Collateral or Secured Party s Lien or security interest in the Collateral, or any part thereof, and shall take such action, employing attorneys agreeable to Secured Party, as may be necessary to preserve Obligor s or Secured Party s rights affected thereby. If Obligor fails or refuses to adequately or vigorously, in the sole judgment of Secured Party defend Obligor s or Secured Party s rights to the Collateral, Secured Party may take such action on behalf of and in the name of Obligor and at Obligor s expense. Moreover, Secured Party may take such independent action in connection therewith as they may in their discretion deem proper, including the right to employ independent counsel and to intervene in any suit affecting the Collateral. All costs, expenses and attorneys fees incurred by Secured Party pursuant to this Section 5.1 or in connection with the defense by Secured Party of any claims, demands or litigation relating to Obligor, the Collateral or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall be paid by Obligor on demand plus interest thereon from the date of the advance by Secured Party until reimbursement of Secured Party at the Default Rate.

ARTICLE VII 

 Secured Party s Remedies Upon Default 

7.1 Possession and Sale of Collateral . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or at any time thereafter, and in addition to all other rights of Secured Party, Secured Party shall have the following rights and powers, but not the obligation: 

(a) to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Obligor, without prejudice to any other remedies hereunder; 

(b) to cause Obligor, at Obligor s expense, to promptly assemble the Equipment, Rigging Equipment, and the Personalty Collateral or any item thereof and return the same to Secured Party at such place as Secured Party may designate in writing; 

(c) to peaceably seize and possess all Collateral, including the Equipment, the Rigging Equipment, and the Personalty Collateral, including entering upon the premises where the Equipment is located, and, without notice to Obligor, and with or without process, take immediate possession of the Equipment, or render the Equipment unusable or immobile, without liability to Obligor by reason of such entry or taking possession, and without such action constituting a termination of this Agreement unless Secured Party notifies Obligor to such effect; 

(d) to selI, lease, or otherwise dispose of the Equipment, the Rigging Equipment, and the Personalty Collateral in a public or private sale or lease transaction, and apply the proceeds of such sale or leasing, after first deducting all costs and expenses of such sale or leasing, to Obligor s Obligations hereunder, with Obligor remaining liable for any deficiency and with any excess being retained by Secured Party, and proceed by court action to enforce performance by Obligor of the applicable covenants of this Agreement or to recover damages for the breach thereof. In addition to the foregoing, Obligor shall be obligated hereunder for the payment of all other amounts then or thereafter payable by Obligor to Secured Party hereunder, including without limitation, amounts owing for indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing: 

(i) 
 The purchaser of any Collateral sold shall thereafter hold title to the same free from any claim or right, including any equity of redemption, of Obligor. Secured Party may make any such sale subject to any limitation or restriction, including but not limited to a limitation in the method of offering the Collateral or in the number or identity of prospective bidders, which Secured Party may believe to be necessary to comply with any requirement of applicable law or in order to obtain any required approval of the purchase or the purchaser by any governmental authority or officer. No such limitation or restriction shall cause such sale not to be considered a commercially reasonable sale, nor shall Secured Party be liable or accountable to Obligor, nor shall the Obligations be subject to any reduction, by reason of the fact that the proceeds of a sale subject to any such limitation or restriction are less than otherwise might have been obtained. Without notice to or consent by Obligor, Secured Party may exercise all rights as the insured, beneficiary, or owner of any insurance policy and may surrender same and receive the surrender value thereof or sell same pursuant to the terms thereof. 

Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Collateral-Page 19 of 23 

(ii) 
 Secured Party shall give Obligor commercially reasonable notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof or of the time after which any private sale or any other intended disposition thereof is to be made.

All expenses of seizing, possessing, retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling, leasing or the like, including Secured Party s attorneys fees and legal expenses, shall be borne by Obligor. Public or private sales, for cash or on credit, to a wholesaler or retailer or investor, or use of Collateral of the types subject to this Agreement, or public auction, are hereby deemed by Obligor to be commercially reasonable because differences in the sales prices generally realized in the different kinds of sales are ordinarily offset by the differences in the costs and the credit risks of such sales. 

(iii) 
 At any sale Secured Party may sell any part of the Collateral without warranty of any kind and may specifically disclaim any warranty of title or the like, and none of the foregoing will be considered to make the sale not commercially reasonable.

In furtherance thereof, the Secured Party shall have the right, without notice or demand to the Pledgor or the Company to foreclose upon the Collateral and to effect a transfer, assignment or other disposition of all of the Collateral to the Secured Party in connection with the same in full, complete and indefeasible satisfaction of any and all outstanding Obligations.

Page 5 of 13 

(c) Each right, power and remedy of the Secured Party provided for in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other such right, power or remedy. The exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Secured Party of any one or more of the rights, powers or remedies provided for in this Agreement or the Note, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by the Secured Party of all such other rights, powers or remedies, and no failure or delay on the part of the Secured Party to exercise any such right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof. No notice to or demand on the Pledgor in any case shall entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Secured Party to any other further action in any circumstances without demand or notice. The Secured Party shall have the full power to enforce or to assign or contract its rights under this Agreement to a third party.

 without notice) to Lessee, Lessor or its agents shall have access to the Equipment

 hours for the purpose of inspection and for any other purposes set forth in the Lease,
 subject to the health, safety, security and environmental requirements of Lessee;

(vii) 
 Section 9(b) of the Master Agreement is hereby amended, modified, and replaced in its entirety as follows: 

Lessee shall execute and deliver
 such instruments, including UCC financing statements, as may need to be filed to evidence the interest of Lessor and its Assignee(s)
 in the Equipment and the Lease subject to Lessee s reasonable, prompt and timely comments thereon. Lessee authorizes Lessor
 and its Assignee(s) to file UCC financing statements without Lessee s signature to evidence the interest of Lessor and its
 Assignee(s) in the Equipment and the Lease. Lessee has no interest in the Equipment except as expressly set forth in the Lease, and
 that interest is a leasehold interest coupled with an option to purchase. Lessor and Lessee agree, and Lessee represents for the
 benefit of Lessor and its Assignee(s) that the Lease is intended to be a true lease as the term is commonly used
 under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). In the event that a Lease is deemed to be a
 lease intended as security or is otherwise deemed to be a secured loan, conditional sale, and/or not a Finance Lease
 or true lease (any of the foregoing, a Conditional Sale ), then Lessee shall be deemed to have granted
 Lessor a first priority security interest in the Equipment related to such Lease to secure all of Lessee s obligations to
 Lessor under such Lease and such security interest shall be perfected in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
 Equipment is located and the jurisdiction of organization of Lessee. 

(viii) 
 Section 9(c) of the Master Agreement is hereby amended, modified, and replaced in its entirety as follows: 

LESSEE SHALL KEEP EACH LEASE,
 THE EQUIPMENT AND ANY IMPROVEMENTS FREE AND CLEAR OF ALL LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES OF WHATSOEVER KIND (EXCEPT FOR PERMITTED
 ENCUMBRANCES DEFINED BELOW) AND LESSEE SHALL NOT ASSIGN ANY LEASE OR ANY OF THE RIGHTS UNDER ANY LEASE OR GRANT ANY RIGHTS TO THE
 EQUIPMENT WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF LESSOR; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, LESSEE MAY SUBLEASE
 ANY OR ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT AT ANY TIME OR FROM TIME TO TIME. No permitted assignment shall relieve Lessee of any of its obligations
 under the Lease and Lessee agrees to pay all costs and expenses Lessor may reasonably incur in connection with the failure of Lessee
 to comply with the foregoing. For purposes of this Master Agreement and each and every Lease, Permitted Encumbrances 
 shall mean (i) any lien for taxes or assessments that are not yet due or delinquent or which are being contested by Lessee in and
 through appropriate proceedings, (ii) any statutory or other lien arising in the ordinary course of business and by operation of law
 with respect to a liability that is not yet due or delinquent or which is being contested by Lessee in and through appropriate
 proceedings, (iii) any pledges or deposits made in the ordinary course of business in compliance with workers compensation,
 unemployment insurance and other social security laws and regulations, (iv) any lien released on or prior to the date hereof without
 liability or obligation attaching to the Equipment, and (v) a sublease to any third party in a form and content reasonably similar
 to that set forth on Attachment B hereto, as may be amended or modified from time to time. 

(ix) 
 Sobriquet (v) of Section 11(a) of the Master Agreement is hereby amended, modified, and replaced in its entirety as follows: 

(v) Lessee shall, if requested, affirm to Assignee that the representations and warranties
 made in the Lease were correct in all material respects when made, and affirm the effectiveness of the and covenants contained in the Lease (upon which Lessee acknowledges Assignee may rely) and shall make such other
 representations, warranties and covenants to Assignee as may be reasonably required
 to give effect to the assignment. 

(x) 
 Section 15 of the Master Agreement is hereby amended, modified, and replaced in its entirety as follows: 

During the term of the Lease, Lessee, at its own expense, shall maintain or cause to be maintained in regard to
 the Equipment, Cause of Loss Special Form, property in transit insurance nationwide
 in scope (i.e., covers claims for damages to an Item anywhere in the United States)
 in each case in an amount not less than the Stipulated Loss Value as identified on
 Attachment A, and commercial general liability insurance in amounts and with carriers
 reasonably satisfactory to Lessor. In lieu of obtaining the Cause of Loss Special Form insurance, Lessee may, with Lessor s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed), participate
 in a self-insurance program (i.e., a risk management pool ). Lessor shall consider such factors as the then creditworthiness of the Lessee and
 Lessee s Guarantors, the participants in the self-insurance program, the administrator of
 such program, and such other information as to the program as Lessor may reasonably
 request in determining whether to consent to Lessee s request. Any such insurance shall name Lessor, its successors and/or assigns, as
 additional insureds, and, as for the Special Form coverage, loss payees, as their
 interests may appear. Lessee shall not terminate, cancel, or alter any insurance coverage
 hereunder without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lessor and Assignee.
 Coverage afforded to Lessor shall not be rescinded, impaired, or invalidated by any
 act or neglect of Lessee. Lessee agrees to supply to Lessor, upon request, evidence
 of such insurance. 

(xi) 
 Sobriquet (vii) of Section 16(a) of the Master Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety. 

(xii) 
 Section 17(a)(2) of the Master Agreement is hereby amended, modified, and replaced in its entirety as follows: 

Except as expressly permitted in any Lease, Lessee, attempts to, or actually does,
 sell, encumber, or assign any of the Equipment, fails to insure (or cause to be insured) any of the Equipment, or fails to deliver any documents of the Lessee under the Lease. 

Schedule Page 4 of 5 Maxus Lease No. 1452-020 

(xiii) 
 The second sentence of Section 17(b) of the Master Agreement is hereby amended, modified, and replaced in its entirety as follows: 

If Lessor elects or is required to file a replevin action, to the extent permitted
 by law, Lessee hereby irrevocably waives any bonds and any surety or security relating
 thereto required by any statute, court rule or otherwise as an incident to such possession,
 and waives any demand for possession prior to the commencement of any suit or action to recover with respect thereto. 

(xiv) 
 Section 20 of the Master Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety. 

(xv) 
 The Master Agreement is hereby amended and modified to reflect the addition and insertion of a new Section 22: 

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Lessee is expressly authorized
 to enter into any number of leases, subleases, and agreements touching, concerning,
 affecting or relating to the Equipment; provided, however, such leases, subleases,
 and agreement do not in any way derogate any rights or remedies of Lessor as provided
 in this Master Agreement and each Lease. 

12. Special Terms: 

i.) Security Deposit to be held by Lessor in any of its accounts
without the payment of interest, and to be applied by Lessor as set forth in Section 19 of the Master Agreement: _____________. 

ii.) Prior to Acceptance: Prior to the receipt by Lessor of

the purchase of Equipment if: (a) Lessee does not execute and deliver to Lessor an Installation Certificate prior to _____________; or
(b) Lessor determines in its sole discretion that a material adverse change has occurred in Lessee s financial condition or business,

iii.) End of Base Term Options: Provided that no Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, at the end of the Base Term of the Lease, Lessee must purchase all but not less than all of the
Equipment for an amount equal to 100 of the Lessor s Cost. Upon receipt of such purchase price, together with any applicable taxes
then or thereafter due, Lessor shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill of sale for the Equipment, without representation or warranty

it will not enter into negotiations for future lease or financing transactions with Lessor s Assignee without the prior written
consent of Lessor. 

iv.) Lessee shall deliver to Lessor upon its execution of this Schedule
and, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, a Location Report (as hereinafter defined) upon Lessor s
reasonable request at any point during the Base Term. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall furnish
Lessor a Location Report within three (3) business days of Lessor s demand. As used in this Lease, the term Location Report 
means a written report prepared by Lessee, setting forth for each unit of Equipment, the name of the party in possession of such unit
of Equipment (which shall be either Lessee or a sublessee), and the GPS coordinates of the place at which such Equipment is then-kept,
or if such location is not available, a detailed description of the nearest principal maintenance shop or storage yard location in such
form to allow Lessor or its agent to locate such location for purposes of inspecting each unit of Equipment, and being otherwise in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and/or its Assignee. Each Location Report shall also be accompanied by a summary of all
maintenance work performed on each unit of Equipment for the period then ending. Lessee shall also make available to Lessor upon demand
access to its GPS tracking software and related records and data with respect to the Equipment. 

v.) Lessee shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Lessor written
notification of a change in the identity of any Contractor from that set forth in the initial Location Report, promptly upon Lessee s
knowledge of such change. Such written notification shall also be accompanied by a certificate of insurance from such successor sublessee
naming Lessor, its successors and/or assigns, as loss payee and additional insured. 

vi.) Lessee shall pay, or reimburse Lessor for, as applicable: (i)
all fees and expenses associated with titling, annual registration, the grant of a power of attorney to Lessee from Lessor, and any other
ministerial expense incurred by Lessor with respect to the Equipment; (ii) obtaining and reviewing all certificates of insurance to ensure
compliance with the applicable provisions of the Master Agreement; (iii) preparation of any amendments to the Lease evidenced by this
Schedule.

additions, amendments, attachments, replacements, and substitutions thereto and all cash and non-cash proceeds thereof (including insurance
proceeds) for the purpose of securing the payment and performance of the obligations of Lessee owing to Lessor under this Lease and all

or amendment, which filing Lessor deems necessary to protect its interest. Upon the occurrence of such default or event of default under

REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO COLLATERAL 

Borrower will not sell or transfer any collateral (except normal inventory turnover in the ordinary course of business) described in the Collateral paragraph hereof without the prior written consent of SBA. 

USE OF LOAN PROCEEDS 

Borrower
will use all the proceeds of this Loan solely as working capital to alleviate economic injury caused by disaster occurring in the month
of January 31, 2020 and continuing thereafter and for loans of more than 25,000 to pay Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) lien filing

reports available to Merchant for verification of its revenues, or, if available, the login and password for the Account. Once, notified of a request for reconciliation, CURVE will instruct it s ACH processor to pause ACH debits from Merchant s account until the reconciliation process is complete. CURVE will complete each reconciliation requested by any Merchant within two business days after receipt of proper notice of a request for one accompanied by the information and documents required for it. CURVE may also conduct a reconciliation on its own at any time by reviewing Merchant(s) s Receivables covering the period from the date of this Agreement until the date of initiation of the reconciliation, each such reconciliation will be completed within two business days after its initiation, and CURVE will give each Merchant written notice of the determination made based on the reconciliation within one business day after its completion. If a reconciliation determines that CURVE collected more than it was entitled to, then CURVE will credit to the Account all amounts to which CURVE was not entitled and, if there is an Estimated Payment, decrease the amount of the Estimated Payment so that it is consistent with the Specified Percentage of Merchant(s) s Receivables from the date of the Agreement through the date of the reconciliation. If a reconciliation determines that CURVE collected less than it was entitled to, then CURVE will debit from the Account all additional amounts to which CURVE was entitled and, if there is an Estimated Payment, increase the amount of the Estimated Payment so that it is consistent with the Specified Percentage of Merchant(s) s Receivables from the date of the Agreement through the date of the reconciliation. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Merchant desires reconciliation it shall be Merchant s sole responsibility to initiate the reconciliation process in this Section 4. Nothing herein limits the amount of times that a reconciliation may be requested or conducted. 

5 . Merchant Deposit Agreement . Merchant(s) shall appoint a bank acceptable to CURVE, to obtain electronic fund transfer services and/or ACH payments. Merchant(s) shall provide CURVE and/or its authorized agent with all of the information, authorizations, and passwords necessary to verify each Merchant s Receivables.

The authorization shall be irrevocable as to each Merchant absent CURVE S written consent until the Receivables Purchased Amount has been paid in full or the Merchant becomes bankrupt or goes out of business without any prior default under this Agreement. 

6 . Term of Agreement .

5. 
 TESTING AND MEASUREMENT. Operators shall cause the Terminal to be capable of measuring the volume of Product delivered by Shipper and provide Shipper with reasonable documentation associated with determining the volume of Product delivered. All measurement sampling equipment activities, procedures, and calculations shall be performed in conformance with the most current international measurement, sampling and analysis standards (API Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards (MPMS), the Energy Institute Hydrocarbon Management Committee (HM), ISO, NIST and ASTM).

If Shipper believes that any custody transfer meter used to measure the volume of crude oil received, stored or delivered hereunder is inaccurate, Shipper may request that Operators have such meter tested by a third party authorized to certify the accuracy of such meters. If such meters are out of compliance with API standards, then (i) such meters shall be brought into compliance with API standards, (ii) the cost of testing and bringing such meters into compliance shall be borne by Operators, and (ii) Operators shall make an adjustment on the immediately following invoice correcting for the measurement of crude oil transloaded hereunder from the time such meter became inaccurate, or if such date is unknown, from the date that is halfway between the date such meter is restored to compliance with API standards and the date of its last certification or the Effective Date hereof, whichever is later. 

6. 
 SCHEDULING MAINTENANCE. Operators shall promptly notify Shipper of any scheduled maintenance of the Terminal. Operators shall consult with Shipper when planning scheduled maintenance to avoid disruption of the Services during the Term. The obligation to pay the Rates set forth in section 9 shall be abated, on an hourly basis rounded to the nearest hour, for any period of time during which the Terminal is unavailable for use during the Term due to maintenance or repair, whether scheduled or not.

Settlements for losses and gains will be made promptly after the end of each calendar year or as of the termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs first. Operators, at their option, shall either replace or pay for all normal handling Product losses or gains in excess of the Loss Allowance. The price per barrel of such Product shall be the NYMEX CMA daily average settle quoted price for Light Sweet Crude Oil (excluding weekends and US holidays). For purposes of clarity, the price calculation will be based on the NYMEX prices for the month in which the losses and/or gains occurred. 

8. 
 TERM. This Agreement shall remain in force and effect from the Effective Date until 11:59 p.m. Dallas, Texas time on December 31, 2034 (the Term ).

Operators shall invoice Shipper monthly. All invoiced amounts shall be due and payable by Shipper to Operators by the twentieth (20th) day of the month following the month in which the Services were performed, provided, however that if such day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or banking holiday, then payment shall be due on the nearest regular business day.

Should Shipper fail to deliver to the Terminals, collectively, a volume equal to or greater than the applicable Minimum Volume Commitment during a given calendar month in the Term and such failure was not due to action or inaction by Operators, Shipper shall pay to Operators the Minimum Volume Commitment multiplied by the Rates. For purposes of calculating such monthly throughput fees, volume shall be calculated as the summation of all net barrels of Product received by Operators from Shipper at the Terminals truck receipt meters in a calendar month. Barrels returned to tank trucks at the Terminals are deemed by the Parties as barrels not transloaded through the Terminals or subject to the Rates. 

4. 
 RECEIPTS AND DELIVERIES.

As a condition to being granted access to the Terminal, Shipper s third-party agents, representatives, carriers, contractors and subcontractors seeking access to the Terminal shall obey Operators rules and regulations at the Terminal. 

5. 
 TESTING AND MEASUREMENT. Operators shall cause the Terminal to be capable of measuring the volume of Product delivered by Shipper and provide Shipper with reasonable documentation associated with determining the volume of Product delivered. All measurement sampling equipment activities, procedures, and calculations shall be performed in conformance with the most current international measurement, sampling and analysis standards (API Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards (MPMS), the Energy Institute Hydrocarbon Management Committee (HM), ISO, NIST and ASTM). Operators shall operate and maintain calibrated, custody transfer-grade meters and certified auto in-line sampler(s) at the Terminal to measure the volume and quality of Product delivered by Shipper hereunder. Operators shall test and prove meters no less than on a quarterly basis. Shipper or its representative shall have the right to witness measurements of the Product, including meter proving, testing, calibrations, gauging, sampling, and verify measurement process system; provided, however, that reasonable advance notification is made by Shipper to Operators. All measurements of Product received by Operators from Shipper shall be made by and at the Terminal s truck receipt meters/auto in-line samplers. All custody transfer documents, including meter tickets generated by Operators shall show the net standard volume (NSV) and such necessary values and calculations for deriving that figure, including opening and closing indicated volumes, meter factor(s), observed API gravity, observed temperature, gross standard volume (GSV), deduction of free water, BS W percentage, temperature and pressure correction factors. All tickets shall be produced and retained electronically. Operators will endeavor to provide copies of all ticket information and data to Shipper within forty-eight (48) hours upon completion of delivery or re-delivery, as the case may be; and in any case no later than two (2) business days.

 Custody transfer meters utilized by Operators at the Terminal shall be capable of measuring volumes of Product and shall be adjusted to a temperature of sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit and a pressure of one standard atmosphere (14.696 PSIA) in accordance with the latest revision of API MPMS Chapter 11 Table 6A both (a) in connection with unloading crude oil from tanker trucks, and (b) in connection with the transmission of crude oil into pipelines. If Shipper believes that any custody transfer meter used to measure the volume of crude oil received, stored or delivered hereunder is inaccurate, Shipper may request that Operators have such meter tested by a third party authorized to certify the accuracy of such meters. If such meters are out of compliance with API standards, then (i) such meters shall be brought into compliance with API standards, (ii) the cost of testing and bringing such meters into compliance shall be borne by Operators, and (ii) Operators shall make an adjustment on the immediately following invoice correcting for the measurement of crude oil transloaded hereunder from the time such meter became inaccurate, or if such date is unknown, from the date that is halfway between the date such meter is restored to compliance with API standards and the date of its last certification or the Effective Date hereof, whichever is later. 

6. 
 SCHEDULING MAINTENANCE. Operators shall promptly notify Shipper of any scheduled maintenance of the Terminal. Operators shall consult with Shipper when planning scheduled maintenance to avoid disruption of the Services during the Term.

Settlements for losses and gains will be made promptly after the end of each calendar year or as of the termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs first. Operators, at their option, shall either replace or pay for all normal handling Product losses or gains in excess of the Loss Allowance. The price per barrel of such Product shall be the NYMEX CMA daily average settle quoted price for Light Sweet Crude Oil (excluding weekends and US holidays). For purposes of clarity, the price calculation will be based on the NYMEX prices for the month in which the losses and/or gains occurred. 

8.

With respect to any Purchased Accounts initially purchased by Financial Institution, Financial Institution may require Business to repurchase all or any portion of such Purchased Accounts owed by any particular Customer if any minimum payment due on one or more of such Purchased Accounts remains unpaid following 120 days after its invoice date . With respect to any Purchased Accounts purchased after Financial Institution s initial purchase, Financial Institution may require Business to repurchase all or any portion of such Purchased Accounts owed by any particular Customer if any minimum payment due on one or more of such Purchased Accounts remains unpaid following 120 days after its invoice date . For purposes of this Agreement, the aging status of Purchased Accounts purchased from Business, as shown on the aging report of Purchased Accounts produced or generated by Financial Institution, will be deemed conclusive (absent manifest error) in determining which Purchased Accounts Financial Institution may require Business to repurchase. Regardless of when purchased, Financial Institution may require Business to repurchase all or any portion of such Purchased Accounts from any particular Customer if such Customer is bankrupt or insolvent, or if any Dispute arises with a Customer regarding such Purchased Accounts. Financial Institution may require Business to repurchase any or all outstanding Purchased Accounts (a) upon a Default, as defined in Section 9, or (b) upon the termination of this Agreement.

3.2 Effecting Repurchase . Should Financial Institution require repurchase of one or more Purchased Accounts, Business will be liable to Financial Institution for payment of the Repurchase Obligation with respect to such Purchased Accounts. Upon an event of Default or termination under this Agreement, the Repurchase Obligation will also include the amount of all indemnities and other Obligations of Business arising under this Agreement. Without notice to or demand on Business, Financial Institution may debit the amount of such Repurchase Obligation (and any amount necessary to bring the Reserve to a level as may be required by Financial Institution in its Business Judgment) against Business Reserve Account, or any deposit account of Business maintained with Financial Institution. Business agrees to and irrevocably waives any right to withdraw Financial Institution s authority, block or otherwise seek to preclude or interfere with the debit authority provided herein until section 11.3 is fully satisfied. In the event any deposit account contains insufficient funds for Financial Institution s debit, or Financial Institution elects not to make such debit, Business agrees to pay any such deficiency or shortfalls on demand. Financial Institution will have no duty to bill or collect any Repurchased Accounts although such accounts shall continue to serve as Financial Institution s Collateral. 

SECTION 4: SECURITY INTEREST . 

4.1 In order to secure Business performance of all Obligations under this Agreement and any other agreement that may now or hereafter be entered into between Business and Financial Institution, Business grants to Financial Institution a continuing first priority ownership interest in the Purchased Accounts and first priority security interest in the Collateral. The priority rights granted by this section are designed to provide Financial Institution with sole rights of enforcement insofar as the collection of all Accounts.

4.3 Business agrees to execute such additional documents and take such further action as Financial Institution may deem necessary or desirable in order to perfect the security interest granted herein and otherwise to effectuate the purposes of the Agreement. In the event that Financial Institution requires additional security for Business Obligations under this Agreement, and Business or other party executes additional security agreements, pledge agreements, guaranties and documents of similar significance (collectively, the Additional Security Documents ), terms used therein such as, but not limited to, loans, indebtedness, and obligations, will be deemed to include the Repurchase Obligations.

Before Business may, under any circumstances, seek to hold Financial Institution responsible for taking any uncommercially reasonable action, Business shall be required to first notify Financial Institution, in writing, of all reasons why Business believes Financial Institution has acted in any uncommercially reasonable manner and advise Financial Institution of the action that Business believes Financial Institution should take.

10.1 Except for a breach by Financial Institution of this Agreement, Business releases, discharges, and acquits Financial Institution, its officers, directors, employees, participants, agents, successors and assigns from any and all claims, demands, losses, and liability of any nature which Business ever had, now or later can, will or may have in connection with, or arising out of, the transactions described in this Agreement and the documentation thereof. Financial Institution will not be liable for any indirect, special or consequential damages, such as loss of anticipated revenues or other economic loss in connection with, or arising out of, any default in performance or other matter arising under this Agreement. Nor will Financial Institution be liable for any errors of judgment or mistake of fact when acting as Business attorney-in-fact, pursuant to Section 7, or liable for delay in the performance of Financial Institution s duties caused by strike, lawsuit, riot, civil disturbance, fire, shortage of supplies or materials, or any other cause reasonably beyond Financial Institution s control. Business indemnifies and holds Financial Institution, its officers, directors, employees, participants, agents, successors and assigns harmless from (and will pay all reasonable attorneys fees with respect to) any loss or claim involving breach of warranty or representation by Business, any claim or liability sustained by virtue of acting in reliance upon data or information furnished by Business to Financial Institution, and any loss or claim by any Customer relating to goods and/or services (or the manner or type of their sale or provision) giving rise to Accounts purchased by Financial Institution hereunder. IF ANY FORM OF LITIGATION IS INSTITUTED BY BUSINESS AGAINST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FOR VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY WRONGFUL CONDUCT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BUSINESS HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. BUSINESS FURTHER AGREES THAT ITS DAMAGES WILL BE LIMITED, IN ANY CASE, TO THE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE CHARGE PAID BY BUSINESS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DURING THE PRECEDING TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD. 

SECTION 11: EFFECTIVE DATE; TERMINATION; BINDING EFFECT 

11.1 This Agreement will be effective when accepted by Financial Institution, and will continue in full force and effect until the earlier of: (a) one year after the effective date of this Agreement, or (b) sixty (60) days after written notice of termination has been given by one party to the other (in each case subject to immediate termination upon a Default); and the term of this Agreement will automatically be extended for periods of one year each following its otherwise scheduled termination, subject to Section 9.2 above, and to the parties rights to terminate this Agreement under clause (b) of this Section 11.1. 

11.2 Upon termination of this Agreement, Business will pay all of its Obligations to Financial Institution, and in any event, Business will remain liable to Financial Institution for any deficiency remaining after liquidation of any Collateral. Financial Institution may withhold any payment to Business unless supplied with an indemnity satisfactory to Financial Institution. This Agreement will bind Business and Business heirs, executors, successors and assigns and will inure to the benefit of Financial Institution and Financial Institution s successors and assigns. Business agrees that Financial Institution may assign this Agreement or delegate its duties under this Agreement, but that Business may not do so without Financial Institution s prior written approval. 

11.3 In recognition of Financial Institution s right to have its attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement secured by the Collateral, notwithstanding payment in full of all Obligations by Business, Financial Institution shall not be required to record any terminations or satisfaction of Financial Institution s security interest in the Collateral or its ownership interest in the Purchased Accounts unless and until Complete Termination has occurred. Business understands that this provision constitutes a waiver of its rights under 9-513 of the UCC. 

Page 11 of 14 

SECTION 12: ATTORNEY S FEES; PAST-DUE OBLIGATIONS; WAIVER; SEVERABILITY; HEADINGS; ENTIRE AND CONTROLLING AGREEMENT; NOTICES; COUNTERPARTS; SAVINGS AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

12.l Business will pay all reasonable expenses incurred by Financial Institution in connection with the execution of this Agreement, including expenses incurred in connection with the filing of financing statements, continuation statements and record searches. All past-due Obligations of Business arising under this Agreement will bear interest at the maximum nonusurious rate permitted under applicable state or federal law. Business hereby waives grace, demand (other than demand pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof), presentment for payment, notice of dishonor or default, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, protest and notice of protest, and bringing of suit against Business. Upon liquidation of any Collateral, settlement or prosecution of a dispute with any Customer, or enforcement of any Obligations of Business under this Agreement, Business will pay to Financial Institution, and Financial Institution may charge to Business account, all costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys fees, and such costs, expenses and fees will constitute part of Business Obligations. No delay or failure on Financial Institution s part in exercising any right, privilege, or option will operate as a waiver of such, or of any other right, privilege, or option, and no waiver, amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless in writing signed by Financial Institution, and then only to the extent stated. Should any provision of this Agreement be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected. The section headings are for convenience only, and will not define or limit the scope, extent, meaning or intent of this Agreement. This Agreement embodies Business entire agreement as to its affiliation with Financial Institution s BusinessManager program, although Business anticipates that Financial Institution will subsequently outline certain depository and other Financial Institution procedures. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any other agreement signed by Business and Financial Institution in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to, any Additional Security Documents, the terms and provisions of this Agreement will control, and the terms and provisions of any such other document will be ineffective to the extent of any such inconsistency. Any notice, request or demand to be given will be deemed given when deposited with a delivery service addressed to, or sent by registered or certified mail to, the address of the recipient listed at the beginning of this Agreement or to subsequent addresses which have been properly noticed to the other party. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, which when taken together, will constitute one and the same Agreement. 

12.2 The parties acknowledge that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are account purchase transactions; however, if they should ever be recharacterized by any court, nothing contained in this Agreement or in any Additional Security Documents will be construed, or will operate in any event, so as to require Business to pay interest at a rate greater than the highest lawful rate of interest permitted by the laws then in force and governing this Agreement. In no event, whether by reason of acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations due or otherwise, will Service Charges contracted for, charged, received, paid or agreed to be paid to Financial Institution, exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any circumstance whatsoever, Service Charges would otherwise be payable to Financial Institution in excess of the maximum lawful amount, the Service Charges will be reduced to the maximum amount permitted under applicable law, and if from any circumstance Financial Institution will have received anything of value deemed interest by applicable law in excess of the maximum lawful amount, an amount equal to any excess will be applied to the reduction of the principal amount of Obligations and not to the payment of Service Charges. If such excess interest exceeds the unpaid balance of the principal amount of Obligations, such excess will be refunded to Business. All Service Charges paid or agreed to be paid to Financial Institution, to the extent permitted by applicable law, will be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of the Agreement until payment in full of all principal Obligations owing by Business, so that the Service Charges for such full term will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. 

12.3 This Agreement shall be deemed to be one of financial accommodation and not assumable by Business as debtor or debtor-in-possession, or any trustee in any bankruptcy proceeding without Financial Institution s express written consent and may be suspended in the event a petition in bankruptcy is filed by or against Business. 

12.4 In the event Business principals, officers or directors, directly or indirectly, form a new entity, whether corporate, partnership, limited liability company or otherwise, similar to that of Business during the term of this Agreement, such newly formed entity shall be deemed to have expressly assumed the Obligations due Financial Institution by Business under this Agreement. Upon the formation of any such newly formed entity, Financial Institution shall be deemed to have been granted an irrevocable power of attorney with authority to execute, on behalf of the newly formed entity, one or more financing statements and have each filed with the appropriate secretary of state or UCC filing office. Financial Institution shall be held-harmless and be relieved of any liability statement or the resulting perfection of a security interest in any of the newly formed entity s assets. In addition, Financial Institution shall have the right to notify the new formed entity s account debtors of Financial Institution s security interest rights, its right to collect all Accounts, and to notify any new factor or lender who has sought to procure a competing lien of Financial Institution s rights in such newly formed entity s assets. 

12.5 Business principal(s) acknowledge that the duty to accurately complete each form of Exhibit A transmitted to Financial Institution is critical to this Agreement and as such all Obligations with respect thereto are non-delegable. Each of Business principal(s) acknowledge that he/s11e shall remain fully responsible for the accuracy of each form of Exhibit A transmitted to Financial Institution regardless of who is delegated the responsibility to prepare and/or complete such Exhibit A. 

Page 12 of 14 

12.6 Business shall fully complete and execute, as taxpayer, prior to or immediately upon the execution of this Agreement, IRS Form 8821 supplied by the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service or such other forms as may be requested by Financial Institution, irrevocably authorizing Financial Institution to inspect or receive tax information relating to any type of tax, tax form, years or periods or otherwise desired by Financial Institution on an ongoing basis. 

12.7 Business will cooperate with Financial Institution in obtaining a control agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Financial Institution with respect to Collateral consisting of a Deposit Account, if such Deposit Account is maintained with any financial institution besides Financial Institution. 

12.8 As to any Account proceeds that do not represent payment of any Purchased Accounts and notwithstanding Financial Institution s security interest therein, so long as Business has not committed an Event of Default, Financial Institution shall be deemed to have received such proceeds of Accounts as a pure pass-through for and on account of Business unless Financial Institution asserts any rights to such proceeds as is authorized by this Agreement. 

12.9 Any claim or cause of action that Business may have or seek to assert against Financial Institution, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall neither constitute a defense nor serve as any basis to excuse non-performance of the Business duty to hold in trust and tum over all proceeds of Accounts to Financial Institution as provided in Section 2.5.4. Business duties and Obligations contained herein shall at all times be deemed independent covenants such that Business duty to honor the provisions of this Section may at no time be excused or otherwise adversely affected due to, inter alia, any breach that Business may assert against Financial Institution. 

12.10 Any claim, dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement must be brought in Business individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (collectively, Class Action ). Accordingly, Business expressly waives any right in respect to any such claim, dispute or controversy to initiate, join or maintain any Class Action in any form. 

12.11 In the event this Agreement is duly terminated in accordance with section 11, and for whatever reason, after such termination, any claim in connection with, related to or..rising under this Agreement is asserted or made against Financial Institution by any person, including Business, Financial Institution shall be entitled to treat all protections afforded to Financial Institution under this Agreement as revived, including, but not limited to, the protections contained in sections 4, 8 and 12.1. 

SECTION 13: ACKNOWLEDGMENT 

THE UNDERSIGNED ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A RELEASE OF CLAIMS AND WAIVERS OF CERTAIN RIGHTS, AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN FULLY UNDERSTOOD PRIOR TO EXECUTION. BUSINESS FURTHER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN LEGAL COUNSEL REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS FULL LEGAL EFFECT, AND THAT IT IS NOT RELYING UPON ANY ORAL REPRESENTATIONS ON THE PART OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, ITS EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT. 

SECTION 14: GENERAL RELEASE 

Business agrees that pursuant to section 11.3, the following rebase language shall be effective upon the termination of this Agreement and Financial Institution shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require Business to reaffirm and acknowledge the effectiveness of this release at the time of termination pursuant to section 11:

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the events of default enumerated in any of the other Loan Documents and all such events of default shall be cumulative. 

12. Remedies and Related Rights .

Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing Events of Default, the entire unpaid balance of principal of the Note, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, and all other Indebtedness owing to Lender by Debtor at such time shall, at the option of Lender, become immediately due and payable without further notice, demand, presentation, notice of dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, protest or notice of protest of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Debtor; provided , however , concurrently and automatically with the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 11(e) , the Indebtedness at such time shall, without any action by Lender, become due and payable, without further notice, demand, presentation, notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration, notice of intent to accelerate, protest or notice of protest of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Debtor. All rights and remedies of Lender set forth in this Agreement and in any of the other Loan Documents may also be exercised by Lender, in its sole discretion, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and not in substitution or diminution of any rights now or hereafter held by Lender under the terms of any other agreement. 

(b) Other Remedies . Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing Events of Default, Lender may from time to time at its discretion, without limitation and without notice except as expressly provided in any of the Loan Documents: 

(i) Exercise in respect of the Collateral all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral); 

(ii) Require Obligor to, and such Person hereby agrees that it will at its expense and upon request of Lender, assemble the Collateral as directed by Lender and make it available to Lender at a place to be designated by Lender which is reasonably convenient to both parties; 

(iii) Reduce its claim to judgment or foreclose or otherwise enforce, in whole or in part, the security interest granted hereunder by any available judicial procedure; 

(iv) Sell or otherwise dispose of, at its office, on the premises of Obligor or elsewhere, the Collateral, as a unit or in parcels, by public or private proceedings, and by way of one or more contracts (it being agreed that the sale or other disposition of any part of the Collateral shall not exhaust Lender s power of sale, but sales or other dispositions may be made from time to time until all of the Collateral has been sold or disposed of or until the Indebtedness has been paid and performed in full), and at any such sale or other disposition it shall not be necessary to exhibit any of the Collateral; 

(v) Buy the Collateral, or any portion thereof, at any public sale; 

(vi) Buy the Collateral, or any portion thereof, at any private sale if the Collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributed standard price quotations; 

LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT PAGE 25 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

(vii) Apply for the appointment of a receiver for the Collateral, and Obligor hereby consents to any such appointment; and 

(viii) At its option, retain the Collateral in satisfaction of the Indebtedness whenever the circumstances are such that Lender is entitled to do so under the UCC or otherwise. 

Obligor agrees that in the event Obligor is entitled to receive any notice under the UCC, as it exists in the state governing any such notice, of the sale or other disposition of any Collateral, reasonable notice shall be deemed given when such notice is deposited in a depository receptacle under the care and custody of the United States Postal Service, postage prepaid, at Obligor s address set forth on the signature page hereof, TEN (10) days prior to the date of any public sale, or after which a private sale, of any of such Collateral is to be held. Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. Lender may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. 

(c) Application of Proceeds . If any Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, Lender may at its sole discretion apply or use any cash held by Lender as Collateral, and any cash proceeds received by Lender in respect of any sale or other disposition of, collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral as follows in such order and manner as Lender may elect: 

(i) to the repayment or reimbursement of the reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by Lender in connection with (1) the administration of the Loan Documents, (2) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, the Collateral, and (3) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights and remedies of Lender hereunder; 

(ii) to the payment or other satisfaction of any Liens and other encumbrances upon the Collateral; 

(iii) to the satisfaction of the Indebtedness; 

(iv) by holding such cash and proceeds as Collateral;

(vi) by delivery to Debtor or any other party lawfully entitled to receive such cash or proceeds whether by direction of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise.

In addition, Debtor and White Claw hereby irrevocably agrees that Lender may, following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, sell any of such Person s inventory directly to any Person, including without limitation Persons who have previously purchased such Person s inventory from such Person and in connection with any such sale or other enforcement of Lender s rights under this Agreement, may sell inventory which bears any trademark owned by or licensed to Debtor or White Claw and any inventory that is covered by any copyright owned by or licensed to Debtor or White Claw and Lender may finish any work in process and affix any trademark owned by or licensed to Debtor or White Claw and sell such inventory as provided herein. 

LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT PAGE 26 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

(e) Deficiency . In the event that the proceeds of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral by Lender are insufficient to pay all amounts to which Lender is legally entitled, Debtor (unless otherwise provided) shall be liable for the deficiency, together with interest thereon as provided in the Loan Documents. 

(f) Non-Judicial Remedies . In granting to Lender the power to enforce its rights hereunder without prior judicial process or judicial hearing, Obligor expressly waives, renounces and knowingly relinquishes any legal right which might otherwise require Lender to enforce its rights by judicial process. Obligor recognizes and concedes that non-judicial remedies are consistent with the usage of trade, are responsive to commercial necessity and are the result of a bargain at arm s length. 

(g) Use and Possession of Certain Premises . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled to occupy and use any premises owned or leased by any Obligor where any of the Collateral or any records relating to the Collateral are located until the Indebtedness is paid or the Collateral is removed therefrom, whichever first occurs, without any obligation to pay such Obligor for such use and occupancy. 

(h) Other Recourse . Obligor waives any right to require Lender to proceed against any third party, exhaust any Collateral or other security for the Indebtedness, or to have any third party joined with Obligor in any suit arising out of the Indebtedness or any of the Loan Documents, or pursue any other remedy available to Lender. Obligor further waives any and all notice of acceptance of this Agreement and of the creation, modification, rearrangement, renewal or extension of the Indebtedness. Obligor further waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any third party or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any third party. Until all of the Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, Obligor shall have no right of subrogation and Obligor waives the right to enforce any remedy which Lender has or may hereafter have against any third party, and waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any other security whatsoever now or hereafter held by Lender. Obligor authorizes Lender, and without notice or demand and without any reservation of rights against Obligor and without affecting Obligor s liability hereunder or on the Indebtedness to (i) take or hold any other property of any type from any third party as security for the Indebtedness, and exchange, enforce, waive and release any or all of such other property, (ii) apply such other property and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Lender may in its Permitted Discretion determine, (iii) renew, extend, accelerate, modify, compromise, settle or release any of the Indebtedness or other security for the Indebtedness, (iv) waive, enforce or modify any of the provisions of any of the Loan Documents executed by any third party, and (v) release or substitute any third party. 

(i) No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies . No failure on the part of Lender to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by law. 

(j) Equitable Relief . Obligor recognizes that in the event Debtor fails to pay, perform, observe, or discharge any or all of the Indebtedness, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to Lender. Obligor therefore agrees that Lender, if Lender so requests, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.

32. Patriot Act Notice . Lender hereby notifies Obligor that pursuant to the requirements of Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of 2001, 31 U.S.C. 5318 (the Act ), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Obligor, which information includes the name and address of Obligor and other information that will allow Lender to identify Obligor in accordance with the Act. In addition, Obligor agrees to (a) ensure that no Person who owns a controlling interest in or otherwise controls Obligor or any Subsidiary of Obligor is or shall be listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Person List or other similar lists maintained by the OFAC, the Department of the Treasury or included in any Executive Order, (b) not to use or permit the use of proceeds of the Loan to violate any of the foreign asset control regulations of the OFAC or any enabling statute or Executive Order relating thereto, and (c) comply, or cause its Subsidiaries to comply, with the applicable laws. 

33. Notice of Right to Receive a Copy of Appraisal . If the Indebtedness is secured by a Lien in real property, Debtor has a right to receive a copy of the appraisal report used in connection with the Loan. If Debtor would like to receive a copy, Debtor must contact Lender at the address set forth herein and request a copy of the appraisal report. Lender must receive such a request from Debtor no later than NINETY (90) days after the Effective Date. 

34. Regulation B . 

(a) Notice of Joint Intent . Federal Regulation B of the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act requires Lender to obtain evidence of Obligor s intention to apply for joint credit or provide a joint guaranty. Obligor s signature below shall evidence such intent. Obligor s intent shall apply to future related extensions of joint credit and joint guaranty. 

(b) Equal Credit Opportunity Act . The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant s income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Federal agency that administers compliance with this law concerning this creditor is: 

Federal Reserve Consumer Help Center 

 P.O. Box 1200 

 Minneapolis, MN 55480 

LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT PAGE 31 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

(c) Disclosure of Right to Request Specific Reasons For Credit Denial . If Obligor s application for business credit is denied, Obligor has the right to a written statement of the specific reasons for the denial. To obtain the statement, please contact Lender within SIXTY (60) days from the date Obligor is notified of Lender s decision. Lender will send Obligor a written statement of reasons for the denial within THIRTY (30) days of receiving Obligor s request for the statement. 

35. Disclosure Relating to Collateral Protection Insurance . As of the date of this disclosure, Debtor and Lender have or shall have consummated a transaction pursuant to which Lender has agreed to make the Loan to Debtor. Obligor has pledged Collateral to secure the Indebtedness in accordance with the Loan Documents. This notice relates to Obligor s obligations with respect to insuring the Collateral against damage. To this end, Obligor must do the following: 

(a) Keep the Collateral insured against damage in the amount equal to the Indebtedness or as otherwise required by the Loan Documents; 

(b) Purchase the insurance from an insurer that is authorized to do business in Texas or an eligible surplus lines insurer; 

(c) Name Lender the person to be paid under the policy in the event of loss; and 

(d) Deliver to Lender a copy of the policy and proof of the payment of premiums. 

Lender may obtain collateral protection insurance on behalf of Obligor at Debtor s expense if Obligor fails to meet any of the foregoing requirements. 

36. Notice of Balloon Payment . At maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), Debtor must repay the entire principal balance of Loan and unpaid interest then due. Lender is under no obligation to refinance the outstanding principal balance of Loan (if any) at that time. Debtor will, therefore, be required to make payment out of other assets Debtor may own; or Debtor will have to find a lender willing to lend Debtor the money at prevailing market rates, which may be higher than the interest rate on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan. 

37. Additional Interest Provision . It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Debtor and Lender at all times to comply strictly with the applicable law governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on the indebtedness evidenced by any Note, any Loan Document, and the Related Indebtedness (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under applicable law). If the applicable law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount (a) contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received pursuant to any Note, any of the other Loan Documents or any other communication or writing by or between Debtor and Lender related to the transaction or transactions that are the subject matter of the Loan Documents, (b) contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by reason of Lender s exercise of the option to accelerate the maturity of any Note and/or any and all indebtedness paid or payable by Debtor to Lender pursuant to any Loan Document other than any Note (such other indebtedness being referred to in this Section as the Related Indebtedness ), or (c) Debtor will have paid or Lender will have received by reason of any voluntary prepayment by Debtor of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness, then it is Debtor s and Lender s express intent that all amounts charged in excess of the Maximum Rate shall be automatically canceled, ab initio , and all amounts in excess of the Maximum Rate theretofore collected by Lender shall be credited on the principal balance of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness (or, if any Note and all Related Indebtedness have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Debtor), and the provisions of any Note and the other Loan Documents shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder; provided, however, if any Note or Related Indebtedness has been paid in full before the end of the stated term thereof, then Debtor and Lender agree that Lender shall, with reasonable promptness after Lender discovers or is advised by Debtor that interest was received in an amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, either refund such excess interest to Debtor and/or credit such excess interest against such Note and/or any Related Indebtedness then owing by Debtor to Lender. In no event shall the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts and revolving triparty accounts) apply to this Note and/or any of the Related Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration. 

LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT PAGE 32 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

38. Tax Information . Obligor understands and agrees that Lender may obtain, use and share Obligor s state and federal tax return information for purposes of: (a) reviewing and responding to the Loan application; (b) originating the Loan; (c) servicing the Loan; (d) selling or transferring all or a part of the Loan or any interest in it; and (e) internal marketing analysis, marketing to Obligor, and other marketing as permitted by law. Obligor understands to accomplish these purposes Lender may need to share this information with third parties, including loan servicers, actual or potential purchasers or investors in loans, government agency loan guarantors, mortgage insurers, marketing companies, and others, depending on the type of Loan applied for, and Obligor agrees to such information sharing for these purposes on Obligor s behalf. For the purpose of this consent to sharing tax return information, Lender and third parties includes the affiliates, agents, and any successors or assigns of Lender and third parties. 

39. Termination . Upon Indefeasible Payment of all Indebtedness, Lender shall execute and deliver to Obligor such documents as Obligor shall reasonably request to evidence termination. 

40. Document Retention Policy . Obligor expressly acknowledges, understands and agrees that Lender s document retention policy involves the imaging of the Loan Documents and the destruction of the paper originals thereof. In connection therewith, Obligor hereby waives any and all rights Obligor has or may have to claim, for any and all purposes whatsoever, that the imaged copies of the Loan Documents are not originals thereof. 

41. Notice of Final Agreement . It is the intention of Obligor and Lender that the following NOTICE OF FINAL AGREEMENT be incorporated by reference into each of the Loan Documents (as the same may be amended, modified or restated from time to time). Obligor and Lender warrant and represent that the entire agreement made and existing by or among Obligor and Lender with respect to the Loan is and shall be contained within the Loan Documents, and that no agreements or promises exist or shall exist by or among, Obligor and Lender that are not reflected in the Loan Documents. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, Obligor acknowledges that Obligor has received a copy of this NOTICE OF FINAL AGREEMENT . 

NOTICE OF FINAL AGREEMENT 

THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE SAME MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

DEED OF TRUST PAGE 3 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

(b) Any and all other sums becoming due and payable by Obligor to Lender as a result of
 advancements made by Lender pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Deed of Trust
 or any other Loan Documents securing or executed in connection with or otherwise relating
 to the Note, including without limitation the repayment of any future advances made
 by Lender to Debtor as provided in paragraph (c) below and the repayment of any sums advanced for the protection of Lender s security pursuant to this Deed of Trust; 

(c) Grantor and Lender contemplate that Lender will, from time to time, engage in various transactions and that from time to time other circumstances may arise, in which Debtor
 becomes obligated to Lender. Grantor understands that some of those transactions and circumstances may be of a
 type that is very different from the loan transaction evidenced in part by the Note
 and the circumstances connected therewith. Grantor desires and intends that Lender engage in all such transactions, and deal
 generally with Debtor with the assurance that any and all indebtedness and obligations
 now owed, and that may hereafter become owing, to Lender from Debtor, will be secured by the liens arising hereunder. Therefore, the conveyance made by this Deed of Trust, in addition to being made to secure payment of the Note, is also
 made in trust to secure and enforce the payment of all other indebtedness and obligations
 of Debtor to Lender whether presently existing, or in any manner or means hereafter
 incurred by Debtor, and evidenced in any manner whatsoever, either by notes, advances,
 overdrafts, bookkeeping entries, guaranty agreements, liens or security interest,
 deeds of trust, or any other method or means including any renewal and extension of
 the Note, or of any part of any present or future indebtedness or other obligations,
 of Debtor and including any further loans and advances made by Lender to Debtor. The fact of repayment of all Indebtedness, and performance of all other obligations,
 of Debtor, to Lender shall not terminate the lien arising hereunder unless the same
 be released by Lender at the request of Grantor; but otherwise it shall remain in
 full force and effect to secure all future advances, indebtedness and other obligations,
 regardless of any additional security that may be taken as to any past or future indebtedness or other
 obligations. In no event shall this conveyance secure payment of any installment loan or any open-end
 line of credit established under the Texas Finance Code; and

provided, however, that the written notice by Lender to Grantor of the breach by Grantor shall contain a statement that Lender exercises
its rights to such Rents. Grantor agrees that, commencing upon delivery of such written notice of an Event of Default by Lender to Grantor,
each tenant of the Property shall make such Rents payable to and pay such Rents to Lender or Lender s agents on Lender s

any part thereof shall be endangered or shall be attacked, directly or indirectly, Grantor authorizes Lender, at Grantor s expense,
to take all necessary and proper steps for the defense of such interest, including the employment of attorneys, the prosecution or defense
of litigation, and the compromise or discharge of claims made against such interest.

 and with provision that (a) each of said policies shall not be terminated, reduced or limited regardless of any breach of the representations
 and agreements set forth therein, and (b) no such policy shall be canceled, endorsed or amended to any extent unless the issuer
 thereof shall have first given Lender at least THIRTY (30) days prior written notice. In case Grantor fails to furnish
 such policies, Lender, at Lender s option, may procure such insurance at Grantor s expense. All renewal and substitute
 policies of insurance shall be delivered to the office of Lender, premiums paid, at least TEN (10) Business Days before
 expiration of the insurance protection to be replaced by such renewal or substituted policies. In case of loss, Lender, at Lender s
 option, shall be entitled to receive and retain the proceeds of the insurance policies, applying the same toward payment of the
 Indebtedness, taxes or other sums due and owing by Grantor in connection with the Property in such manner as Lender may elect,
 or at Lender s option, Lender may pay the same over wholly or in part to Grantor for the repair of said Improvements or for
 the erection of new Improvements in their place, or for any other purpose satisfactory to Lender, but Lender shall not be obligated
 to see to the proper application of any amounts so paid to Grantor. If Lender elects to allow such payments to Grantor, disbursement
 shall be on such terms subject to such conditions as Lender may specify. Regardless of whether any insurance proceeds are sufficient

 any insurance policy covering any part of the Property. Furthermore, for any portion of the Property situated in an area having
 special flood hazards (as defined in the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended from time to time, or any similar legislation),

 the maximum amount of flood insurance available, whichever is the lesser. Notwithstanding the preceding and any contrary provision
 in the Loan Documents, if an Event of Default does not then exist, Lender agrees to use (or allow Grantor to use) such insurance
 proceeds to restore or rebuild the Improvements to their previous condition provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:
 (i) Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it is economically, financially and practically feasible to repair and
 restore the Improvements to their previous condition prior to the Note s maturity date; (ii) the total cost of repairing
 and restoring the Improvements to their previous condition, as estimated by an architect or engineer approved by Lender (which
 shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed by Lender), shall not be greater than the amount of such insurance proceeds
 together with any sums that Grantor deposits with Lender in advance for the purpose of paying for the cost of such repairs and
 restoration; (iii) such restoration and repair shall be accomplished in accordance with the standard requirements and conditions
 of Lender when monitoring and advancing in connection with a construction loan of similar size and complexity; (iv) all guarantees
 of the Indebtedness, or any portion thereof, shall remain in full force and effect and such Guarantors shall so confirm to Lender
 if requested by Lender; and (v) Grantor shall have provided to Lender satisfactory evidence that there has been no adverse change

 mail to any other person may, if no address for such other person is shown by records of Lender, be addressed to such other person

 the whole of the Property, but Lender shall have the right, at its sole election,
 to request Trustee to sell less than the whole of the Property. If there is a default on the payment of any installment on the Note or any portion
 of the Indebtedness, and Lender elects not to accelerate the unpaid balance of the

 satisfaction of such unpaid installment or other amount either through judicial proceedings
 or by directing Trustee to proceed as if under a full foreclosure, conducting the
 sale as herein provided without declaring the entire Indebtedness due. It is agreed that such sale, if so made, shall not in any manner affect the unmatured

 to be so accepted, and Grantor hereby ratifies and confirms every act that Trustee
 or any substitute Trustee hereunder may lawfully do in the premises by virtue hereof,
 and (b) the purchaser may disaffirm any easement granted, subdivision plat filed, or rental,
 lease or other contract made in violation of any provision or this Deed of Trust,

 power, and duties conferred upon the Trustee by this Deed of Trust and by applicable
 law.

BY LENDER NOT A WAIVER . Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise afforded by applicable
law, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of payment of any sum secured

when due of all other sums so secured or to declare a default for failure to make prompt payment. The procurement of insurance or the
payment of taxes or other liens or charges by Lender shall not be a waiver of Lender s right to accelerate the maturity of the

DEED OF TRUST PAGE 15 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

8.13 WAIVER OF DEFICIENCY STATUTE . In the event an interest in any of the Property is foreclosed upon pursuant to a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure sale, Debtor agrees as follows: notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 51.003, 51.004, and 51.005 of the Texas Property Code (as the same may be amended from
 time to time), and to the extent permitted by law, Debtor agrees that Lender shall
 be entitled to seek a deficiency judgment from Debtor and any other party obligated
 on the Note equal to the difference between the amount owing on the Note and the amount
 for which the Property was sold pursuant to judicial or non-judicial foreclosure sale.
 Debtor expressly recognizes that this Section constitutes a waiver of the above-cited provisions of the Texas Property Code which would otherwise permit Debtor and other persons against whom recovery
 of deficiencies is sought or Guarantor independently (even absent the initiation of
 deficiency proceedings against them) to present competent evidence of the fair market
 value of the Property as of the date of the foreclosure sale and offset against any
 deficiency the amount by which the foreclosure sale price is determined to be less
 than such fair market value. Debtor further recognizes and agrees that this waiver
 creates an irrefutable presumption that the foreclosure sale price is equal to the fair
 market value of the Property for purposes of calculating deficiencies owed by Debtor,
 Guarantor, and others against whom recovery of a deficiency is sought. 
 
 8.14 WAIVER OF MARSHALLING . Notwithstanding the existence of any other security interests in the Property held by Lender or by any other party, Lender shall have the right to determine the order in which any or all portions of the Indebtedness are satisfied from the proceeds realized upon

 acquires a security interest in the Property and who has actual or constructive notice
 of this Deed of Trust and Lender s rights and interests under this Deed of Trust, hereby waive any and all right to
 require the marshalling of assets in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies
 permitted by applicable law or provided by this Deed of Trust.

DEED OF TRUST PAGE 19 B1BANK MERIDIAN EQUIPMENT LEASING LLC 

10.07 AGENTS . In exercising any rights hereunder or taking any actions provided for herein, Lender
 may act through its employees, agents or independent contractors as authorized by
 Lender. 
 
 10.08 GOVERNING LAW . THIS DEED OF TRUST SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
 AND THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA APPLICABLE TO TRANSACTIONS IN THE STATE
 OF TEXAS. 
 
 10.09 SEVERABILITY . In the event that any provision of this Deed of Trust or the Note conflicts with applicable law, such conflict shall not affect other provisions of
 this Deed of Trust or the Note which can be given effect without the conflicting provisions,
 and to this end the provisions of this Deed of Trust and the Note are declared to
 be severable. 
 
 10.10 USURY DISCLAIMER . The term Maximum Lawful Rate means the maximum rate of interest and the term Maximum Lawful Amount means the maximum amount of interest that is permissible under applicable state or federal law for the type of loan evidenced by
 the Note and the other Loan Documents. Lender does not intend to contract for, charge or receive more than the Maximum Lawful
 Rate or Maximum Lawful Amount permitted by applicable state or federal law, and to
 prevent such an occurrence Lender and Grantor agree that all amounts of interest,
 whenever contracted for, charged or received by Lender, with respect to the loan of
 money evidenced by the Note or with respect to any other amount payable under this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, shall be spread, prorated or allocated over the full period
 of time the Note is unpaid, including the period of any renewal or extension of the Note. If demand for payment of the Note is made by Lender prior to the full stated term,
 the total amount of interest contracted for, charged or received to the time of such
 demand shall be spread, prorated or allocated along with any interest thereafter accruing
 over the full period of time that the Note thereafter remains unpaid for the purpose of determining if such Interest exceeds the Maximum Lawful Amount. At maturity (including maturity due to Lender s acceleration of the Note) or on earlier final payment of the Note, Lender shall
 compute the total amount of interest that has been contracted for, charged or received
 by Lender or payable by Grantor under the Note and compare such amount to the Maximum Lawful Amount that could have been contracted for, charged or received by Lender. If such computation reflects that the total amount of interest that has been contracted
 for, charged or received by Lender or payable by Grantor exceeds the Maximum Lawful
 Amount, then Lender shall apply such excess to the reduction of the principal balance and not to the payment of interest; or if such excess interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance, such excess
 shall be refunded to Grantor. This provision concerning the crediting or refund or excess Interest shall control
 and take precedence over other agreements between Grantor and Lender so that under
 no circumstances shall the total interest contracted for, charged or received by Lender
 exceed the Maximum Lawful Amount. 
 
 10.11 PARTIAL INVALIDITY . In the event any portion of the sums intended to be secured by this Deed of Trust
 cannot be lawfully secured hereby, payments in reduction of such sums shall be applied
 first to those portions not secured hereby. 
 
 10.12 CAPTIONS . The captions and headings of the Articles and Sections of this Deed of Trust are for convenience only and are not to be used to interpret or define the terms
 and provisions of this Deed of Trust. 
 
 10.13 DEFINITIONS . Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Deed of Trust shall have the meanings
 attributed to such terms in the Loan Agreement. 
 
 10.14 WAIVER
OF JURY TRIAL . GRANTOR AND LENDER EACH WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY
RIGHTS (i) UNDER THIS DEED OF TRUST OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENT OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT WHICH MAY IN THE
FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR ANY RELATED DOCUMENT OR (ii) ARISING FROM ANY BANKING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY. GRANTOR AGREES THAT IT WILL

Lessor s Representative ______________ Page 9 of 14 Lessee s Representative ______________

 the negligence, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional conduct of Lessee, its employees, officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, representatives, agents, customers, guests, invitees, or licensees, Lessee shall give Lessor written notice of the damage and if repairs are not undertaken by Lessee within the later of thirty (30) calendar days from the (a) date of such notice to Lessor, or (b) the date Lessor repairs the portion of the Premises Lessor is responsible for repairing, Lessor may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Lessee. If Lessor elects not to terminate, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the damages to the Premises shall be repaired by and at the expenses of Lessee, except to the extent provided for or compensated for by Lessor s insurance.

B.

C. 
 Lessee shall fail to perform any of the covenants, obligations, and/or requirements of this Agreement. 

Upon the occurrence of any one or more of such events of default, at the option of Lessor, (a) this Agreement shall cease and terminate immediately and Lessee shall quit and surrender the Premises to Lessor, or (b) Lessor may pursue any remedy available to Lessor, whether by law or contract, or in equity, including without limitation the repossession of the Premises by Lessor without terminating the Agreement, in which event Lessee shall be liable for all Rent payable through the date of repossession, plus Rent required to be paid by Lessee during the remainder of the Initial Term (or, if applicable, any renewal term), which will only be diminished by any sums thereafter received by Lessor through reletting the Premises during said period. If this Agreement shall be terminated by Lessor pursuant to this Section, Lessor may at any time thereafter resume possession of the Premises by any lawful means and remove Lessee and Lessee s property therefrom. Lessor and Lessee agree that time is of the essence with respect to all matters described in this Section and any act or omission by Lessee which delays Lessor s ability to pursue its right under this Section shall provide grounds for Lessor to seek damages and losses as a result
 of Lessee s acts or omissions, including, but not limited to, (a) all lost rental payments as a result of Lessee s actions or omissions at the rate of Rent provided herein, (b) stipulated, liquidated, and/or contractual damages worth two times the remaining Rent due on the Initial Term or any renewal thereof by Lessee, and (c) all costs, attorney s fees, and expenses associated with the pursuit and prosecution of this Section.

 not be in default of this Agreement if Lessor commences to cure the default within the thirty (30) calendar day period and in good faith continues to cure the default thereafter. In the event Lessor fails to cure a default and the continuance of such default results in the interruption of Lessee s peaceable enjoyment of the Premises, then Lessee shall be entitled to abatement of the Rent payable under this Agreement in an amount representing the same proportion as the percentage of the total Premises rendered unusable by Lessor s default. 

18. 
 SURRENDER OF PREMISES : 

Upon termination of this Agreement by lapse of time or otherwise, Lessee shall immediately surrender the Premises in as good condition
 as they were in at the beginning of the Initial Term, ordinary wear and tear and alterations, changes and additions made in compliance with this Agreement, acts of God, and other casualty excepted.

If Lessee elects to exercise its purchase option, upon receipt of such purchase price, together with any applicable taxes then or thereafter due, Lessor shall execute and deliver to Lessee a bill of sale for the Equipment, without representation or warranty except that the Equipment is free and clear of any liens, claims or encumbrances created by or through Lessor.

(a) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio : Lessee shall maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00, calculated and tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter during the Base Term on a trailing twelve-month basis beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. As used herein, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be defined as (1) the EBITDA of Lessee, being the sum of net income plus (+) interest expense, plus (+) federal, state and local income taxes, plus (+) depreciation and amortization, such sum to be divided by (2) the aggregate payment obligations of Lessee, being the principal payments on all long-term debt, plus (+) interest expense, plus (+) federal, state and local income taxes. 

(b) Leverage Ratio : Lessee shall maintain a Debt to Tangible Net Worth Ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.00, calculated and tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter during the Base Term beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. 

Leverage Ratio shall be defined as follows: (1) Total Liabilities minus (-) Subordinated Debt, as defined below, divided by (2) Tangible Net Worth (total assets minus (-) intangible assets, which include patents and copyrights, minus (-) Total Liabilities plus (+) Subordinated Debt. 

Subordinated Debt shall mean the present balance of liabilities owed by Lessee to its equity members, officers, and affiliated companies, as identified in a debt schedule provided by Lessee of the same date as the applicable fiscal quarter financial statements for which this Leverage Ratio is being calculated. 

(c) Cash Flow Distribution : After the Base Term Commencement Date and continuously thereafter while any Rent payments are due and owing Lessor, any equitable distribution of cash by Lessee to its members is subject to the approval of Lessor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

vii.) Lessee will maintain with Lessor a Cash Reserve in an amount equal to a maximum of six Base Monthly Rental payments totaling 192,966.00 (the Maximum Reserve). The first 50,000.00 will be funded as part of the Value of Calculation for Stipulated Loss Value. Commencing on the twenty-fourth (24th) day of the month immediately following the Base Term Commencement Date, or in the case of such day being a Saturday, Sunday, or New York banking holiday, then on the first succeeding regular banking day, and thereafter each month during the Base Term, Lessee shall pay Lessor by wire transfer to an account designated by Lessor, which account may change from time to time, a cash reserve payment equal to 11,913.83 (the Reserve Payment ), monthly in arrears, during the first twelve (12) months of the Base Term until Lessor has received an additional amount equal to 142,966.00. For the purpose of securing all of Lessee s obligations under the Master Agreement and all Schedules, Lessee grants to Lessor a security interest in the Cash Reserve described herein. Any and all such Cash Reserve may be commingled by Lessor with other funds without any interest payable to Lessee. Upon an Event of Default by Lessee hereunder, Lessor may, but shall not be obligated to, apply any such Cash Reserve to any obligation of Lessee under any Lease, in which event Lessee shall promptly restore the amount thereof on demand. Upon compliance by Lessee with all terms of each Schedule, and within thirty (30) days after the End of Term, Lessor shall return to Lessee the balance of any Cash Reserve. Lessee agrees that, in the event of Lessee s bankruptcy, Lessor shall be entitled to set off and retain any amount of the Cash Reserve against any and all amounts due to Lessor from Lessee, whether such amounts are classified as pre-petition or post-petition liabilities and whether or not the same are entitled to priority. 

viii.) If Lessor takes possession of the Equipment, whether in exercising a remedy under this Lease or as a result of Lessee s election to return the Equipment to Lessor at End of Term, then Lessee hereby grants Lessor a non-exclusive right of restricted use and license, at no cost to Lessor, of Lessee s intellectual property and other proprietary technology related to the Equipment, including, but not limited to, Lessee s rights in the proprietary and confidential information of the Equipment s manufacturer and vendor and the Assignment of Lease Agreements detailed in section XI of the attached Exhibit A - Equipment Description, solely (a) to allow Lessor to demonstrate the Equipment to prospective purchasers or lessees, and (b) to grant a one-time sub- license of said intellectual property to any actual purchaser or lessee of the Equipment on a no-fee basis.
