 Reserves for Variable Consideration and Credit Risk 
 Revenues from CRA's consulting services are recorded at the net transaction price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established. Variable consideration reserves are based on specific price concessions and those expected to be extended to CRA customers estimated by CRA's historical realization rates. Reserves for variable consideration are recorded as a component of the allowances for accounts receivable and unbilled services on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the reserves for variable consideration are included in revenues on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Reimbursable Expenses 
 Revenues also include reimbursements for costs incurred by CRA in fulfilling its performance obligations, including travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, fees for outside consultants, and other reimbursable expenses. CRA recovers substantially all of these costs. 
 
 Contract Balances from Contracts with Customers 
 The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts receivables, unbilled services, and contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Revenues recognized for services performed, but not yet billed to clients, are recorded as unbilled services. 
 Unbilled services, net 
 CRA defines contract assets as assets for which it has recorded revenue because it determines that it is probable that it will earn a performance-based or contingent fee, but is not yet entitled to receive a fee because certain events, such as completion of the measurement period or client approval, must occur. The contract assets balance was immaterial as of September 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. 
 When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring consulting services to the customer under the terms of a contract, a contract liability is recorded. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue after performance obligations have been satisfied and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

 Fiscal Quarter Ended September 28, 2024, Compared to the Fiscal Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues. Revenues increased by 20.1 million, or 13.6 , to 167.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 147.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Utilization increased to 76 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 66 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, while consultant headcount decreased from 1,014 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 978 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Overall, revenues outside of the U.S. represented approximately 19 and 20 of net revenues for the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. Revenues derived from fixed-price projects remained unchanged at 18 of net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The percentage of revenue derived from fixed-price projects depends largely on the proportion of our revenues derived from our management consulting business, which typically has a higher concentration of fixed-price service contracts. 
 Costs of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by 9.3 million, or 8.8 , to 115.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 105.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in costs of services was due to an increase in employee and incentive compensation of 10.6 million and an increase in forgivable loan amortization of 0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in client reimbursable expenses of 1.8 million. As a percentage of revenues, costs of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased to 68.7 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 71.8 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 3.4 million, or 12.2 , to 31.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 27.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Within this category of expenses, there was a 1.5 million increase in employee and incentive compensation, a 1.1 million increase in software subscription and data services, a 0.7 million increase in rent expense, a 0.4 million increase in training and marketing expense, and a 0.1 million increase in miscellaneous and other fees partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in travel and entertainment for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 18.6 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 18.9 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Commissions to our non-employee experts remained unchanged at 2.4 of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Provision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision was 4.6 million and the effective tax rate ("ETR") was 28.7 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 1.9 million and 18.3 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The ETR for the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 was higher than the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by an increase in the tax benefit related to share-based compensation. 
 Net Income. Net income increased to 11.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 8.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The net income per diluted share was 1.67 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 1.21 of net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased by approximately 240,000 shares to approximately 6,843,000 shares for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from approximately 7,083,000 shares for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the repurchase of shares of our common stock since September 30, 2023, offset in part by the vesting of shares of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units and the exercise of stock options since September 30, 2023. 
 
 Fiscal Year-to-Date Period Ended September 28, 2024, Compared to the Fiscal Year-to-Date Period Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues. Revenues increased by 48.6 million, or 10.5 , to 511.0 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from 462.4 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. Utilization increased to 75 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from 69 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023, while consultant headcount decreased from 1,014 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 978 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Overall, revenues outside of the U.S. represented approximately 18 and 22 of net revenues for the fiscal year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenues derived from fixed-price projects remained unchanged at 18 of net revenues for the fiscal year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 percentage of revenue derived from fixed-price projects depends largely on the proportion of our revenues derived from our management consulting business, which typically has a higher concentration of fixed-price service contracts. 
 Costs of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by 32.3 million, or 9.9 , to 359.4 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from 327.1 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in costs of services was due to an increase of 27.6 million in employee compensation and fringe benefit costs, an increase in forgivable loan amortization of 4.4 million, and an increase in client reimbursable expenses of 0.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, costs of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased to 70.3 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from 70.7 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 7.7 million, or 8.9 , to 93.8 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from 86.1 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. Within this category of expenses, there was a 3.5 million increase in employee compensation and fringe benefit costs, a 1.5 million increase in software subscriptions and data services, a 0.8 million increase in rent expense, a 0.6 million increase in commissions to our non-employee experts, a 0.4 million increase in training and marketing expense, and a 0.9 million increase in miscellaneous and other fees for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 as compared to the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. 
 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 18.4 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from 18.6 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. Commissions to our non-employee experts decreased to 2.3 of revenues for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 compared to 2.4 of revenues for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. 
 Provision for Income Taxes. The income tax provision was 13.0 million and the ETR was 29.1 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, compared to 9.7 million and 26.4 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. The ETR for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 was higher than the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance in the prior fiscal year-to-date period, partially offset by an increase in the tax benefit related to share-based compensation. 
 Net Income. Net income increased by 4.7 million to 31.7 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from 27.0 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. The diluted net income per share was 4.57 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, compared to diluted net income per share of 3.78 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding decreased by approximately 216,000 to approximately 6,922,000 shares for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 from approximately 7,138,000 shares for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to the repurchase of shares of our common stock since September 30, 2023, offset in part by the vesting of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units and the exercise of stock options since September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Fiscal Year-to-Date Period Ended September 28, 2024 
 We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. As of September 28, 2024, we had 24.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 135.9 million of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. 
 General. During the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents decreased by 21.1 million. We completed the period with cash and cash equivalents of 24.5 million. The principal drivers of the decrease of cash and cash equivalents was payment of a significant portion of our fiscal 2023 performance bonuses in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, forgivable loan advances, the repurchase of shares, and the payment of dividends, offset by net borrowings of 60.0 million. 
 At September 28, 2024, 1.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held within the U.S. We have sufficient sources of liquidity in the U.S., including cash flow from operations and availability on our revolving credit facility to fund U.S. operations for the next 12 months without the need to repatriate funds from our foreign subsidiaries.

Table of Contents 

 Sources and Uses of Cash. During the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 29.7 million. Net income was 31.7 million for the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024. Uses of cash for operating activities included a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities of 24.2 million, primarily due to the payment of a significant portion of our fiscal 2023 performance bonuses and performance awards, an increase of 23.3 million in unbilled receivables, a 12.2 million decrease in lease liabilities, an increase in forgivable loans for the period of 14.0 million, which was primarily driven by 38.1 million of forgivable loan issuances, net of repayments, offset by 24.1 million of forgivable loan amortization, a 10.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and an increase of 9.0 million in accounts receivable. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was an increase of 7.3 million in incentive cash awards payable 
 Non-cash items included right-of-use amortization of 11.3 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 8.5 million, and share-based compensation expenses of 3.8 million. 
 During the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 7.5 million, which included capital expenditures, primarily related to computer equipment. 
 During the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 15.8 million, primarily as a result of net borrowings under the revolving credit facility of 60.0 million. Offsetting this increase in cash provided by financing activities were repurchases of common stock of 33.3 million, payment of cash dividends of 8.9 million, and tax withholding payments reimbursed by restricted shares on vesting of 2.0 million. 
 Lease Commitments 
 We are a lessee under certain operating leases for office space and equipment. Certain of our operating leases have terms that impose asset retirement obligations due to office modifications or the periodic redecoration of the premises, which are included in other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at a value based on their estimated discounted cash flows. At September 28, 2024, we expect to incur asset retirement obligation or redecoration obligation costs over the next twelve months of 0.1 million. The remainder of our asset retirement obligations and redecoration obligations are approximately 3.2 million and are expected to be paid between fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2033 when the underlying leases terminate or when the respective lease agreement requires redecoration. We expect to satisfy these lease and related obligations as they become due from cash generated from operations. 
 Indebtedness 
 CRA is party to a Credit Agreement, dated as of August 19, 2022 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as swingline lender, a letter of credit issuing bank and administrative agent, and with Citizens Bank, N.A., as a letter of credit issuing bank. The Credit Agreement provides CRA with a 250.0 million revolving credit facility, which may be decreased at CRA's option to 200.0 million during the period from July 16 in a year through January 15 in the next year. Additionally, for the period from January 16 to July 15 of each calendar year, CRA may elect to not increase the revolving credit facility to 250.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes a 25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. 
 We may use the proceeds of the revolving credit loans under the Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes and may repay any borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time, but any borrowings must be repaid no later than August 19, 2027. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one of the following rates, at our election, plus an applicable margin as described below: (i) in the case of borrowings in U.S. dollars by us, the Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (ii) in the case of borrowings in U.S. dollars, a rate based on Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period, (iii) in the case of borrowings in Euros, EURIBOR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period, (iv) in the case of borrowings in Pounds Sterling, a daily rate based on SONIA (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (v) in the case of borrowings in Canadian Dollars, Term CORRA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period, (vi) in the case of borrowings in Swiss Francs, a daily rate based on SARON (as defined in the Credit Agreement), or (vii) in the case of borrowings in any other Alternate Currency (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the relevant daily or term rate determined as provided in the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin on borrowings based on the Base Rate varies within a range of 0.25 to 1.00 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio, and the applicable margin on borrowings based on any of the other rates described above varies within a range of 1.25 to 2.00 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio. 
 We are required to pay a fee on the amount available to be drawn under any letter of credit issued under the revolving credit facility at a rate per annum that varies between 1.25 and 2.00 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio. In 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 addition, we are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at a rate per annum that varies between 0.175 and 0.250 depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, CRA must comply with various financial and non-financial covenants. The primary financial covenants consist of a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1. The primary non-financial covenants include, but are not limited to, restrictions on CRA's ability to incur future indebtedness, engage in acquisitions or dispositions, pay dividends or repurchase capital stock, and enter into business combinations. Any indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility may become immediately due upon the occurrence of stated events of default, including CRA's failure to pay principal, interest or fees, or upon the breach of any covenant. As of September 28, 2024, CRA was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Agreement. 
 There was 60.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 28, 2024 and no borrowings outstanding as of December 30, 2023. As of September 28, 2024, the amount available under the revolving credit facility was reduced by certain letters of credit outstanding, which amounted to 4.1 million. 
 Forgivable Loans 
 In order to attract and retain highly skilled professionals, we may issue forgivable loans or term loans to employees and non-employee experts. A portion of these loans is collateralized by key person life insurance. The forgivable loans have terms that are generally between two and six years. The principal amount of forgivable loans and accrued interest is forgiven by us over the term of the loans, so long as the employee or non-employee expert continues employment or affiliation with us and complies with certain contractual requirements. The forgiveness of the principal amount of the loans is recorded as compensation over the service period, which is consistent with the term of the loans. 
 Compensation Arrangements 
 We have entered into compensation arrangements for the payment of performance awards to certain of our employees and non-employee experts that are payable if specific performance targets are met. The financial targets may include a measure of revenue generation, profitability, or both. The amounts of the awards to be paid under these compensation arrangements could fluctuate depending on future performance during the applicable measurement periods. Changes in the estimated awards are expensed prospectively over the remaining service period. We believe that we will have sufficient funds to satisfy any cash obligations related to the performance awards. We expect to fund any cash payments from existing cash resources, cash generated from operations, or borrowings available on our revolving credit facility. 
 Our Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2006 Equity Plan"), authorizes the grant of a variety of incentive and performance equity awards to our directors, employees and non-employee experts, including stock options, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other equity awards. 
 Our long-term incentive program, or "LTIP," is used as a framework for equity grants made under our 2006 equity incentive plan to our senior corporate leaders, practice leaders, and key revenue generators. The equity awards granted under the LTIP include stock options, time-vesting restricted stock units, and performance-vesting restricted stock units. 
 Our LTIP allows us to grant service- and performance-based cash awards in lieu of, or in addition to, equity awards to our senior corporate leaders, practice leaders, and key revenue generators. The compensation committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for approving all cash and equity awards under the LTIP. We expect to fund any cash payments from existing cash resources, cash generated from operations, or borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. 
 Business and Talent Acquisitions 
 As part of our business, we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other consulting firms, practices or groups, or other businesses. In recent years, we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash, or a combination of cash and our common stock, and we may continue to do so in the future. To pay for an acquisition, we may use cash on hand, cash generated from our operations, borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, or we may pursue other forms of financing. Our ability to secure short-term and long-term debt or equity financing in the future, including our ability to refinance our credit agreement, will depend on several factors, including our future profitability, the levels of our debt and equity, restrictions under our existing revolving credit facility with our bank, and the overall credit and equity market environments.

 Share Repurchases 
 In February 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an expansion of our existing share repurchase program of an additional 35.0 million of our common stock, for a total authorized amount of 46.4 million. We may repurchase shares under this program in open market purchases (including through any Rule 10b5-1 plan adopted by us) or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable insider trading and other securities laws and regulations. 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares under this share repurchase program. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, we repurchased and retired 206,379 shares under our share repurchase program at an average price per share of 161.59. During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, we did not repurchase any shares under this share repurchase program. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased and retired 211,971 shares under our share repurchase program at an average price per share of 111.23. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 13.1 million available for future repurchases under our share repurchase program. We plan to finance future repurchases with available cash, cash from future operations, and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. We expect to continue to repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. 
 Dividends to Shareholders 
 We anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends each year. These dividends are anticipated to be funded through cash flow from operations, available cash on hand, and/or borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. Although we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, the declaration, timing and amounts of any such dividends remain subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. During the fiscal quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents of 2.9 million and 8.9 million, respectively. During the fiscal quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents of 2.5 million and 7.8 million, respectively. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance, however, that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future. 
 Future Capital and Liquidity Needs 
 We anticipate that our future capital and liquidity needs will principally consist of funds required for: 
 operating and general corporate expenses relating to the operation of our business, including the compensation of our employees under various annual bonus or long-term incentive compensation programs; 
 the hiring of individuals to replenish and expand our employee base; 
 capital expenditures, primarily for information technology equipment, office furniture and leasehold improvements; 
 debt service and repayments, including interest payments on borrowings from our revolving credit facility; 
 share repurchases under programs that we may have in effect from time to time; 
 dividends to shareholders; 
 potential acquisitions of businesses that would allow us to diversify or expand our service offerings; 
 contingent obligations related to our acquisitions; and 
 other known future contractual obligations. 
 The hiring of individuals to replenish and expand our employee base is an essential part of our business operations and has historically been funded principally from operations. Many of the other above activities are discretionary in nature. For example, capital expenditures can be deferred, acquisitions can be forgone, and share repurchase programs and regular dividends can be suspended. As such, our operating model provides flexibility with respect to the deployment of cash flow from operations. Given this flexibility, we believe that our cash flows from operations, supplemented by cash on hand and 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 borrowings under our revolving credit facility (as necessary), will provide adequate cash to fund our long-term cash needs from normal operations for at least the next twelve months. 
 Our conclusion that we will be able to fund our cash requirements by using existing capital resources and cash generated from operations does not take into account the impact of any future acquisition transactions or any unexpected significant changes in the number of employees or other expenditures that are currently not contemplated. The anticipated cash needs of our business could change significantly if we pursue and complete additional business acquisitions, if our business plans change, if economic conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated, or if other unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business. Any of these events or circumstances, including any new business opportunities, could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently available sources and could require us to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet those needs on terms that may be less favorable compared to our current sources of capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, is subject to a variety of factors that we cannot predict with certainty, including: 
 our future profitability; 
 the quality of our accounts receivable; 
 our relative levels of debt and equity; 
 the volatility and overall condition of the capital markets; and 
 the market prices of our securities. 
 
 Factors Affecting Future Performance 
 Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make in this report, as well as a description of material risks we face, are set forth below under the heading Risk Factors and included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. If any of these risks, or any risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024. For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. This is done in order to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 Management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material aspects, our financial position at the end of, and the results of operations and cash flows for, the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated whether there were any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the above evaluation that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents 

 Important Considerations 
 The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.
