NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 The Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words believe, may, will, potentially, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, could, would, project, plan, expect, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 
 These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following: 
 our strategy, business plan and our ability to effectively manage our growth and business operations; 
 our expectations with respect to recognizing revenue related to remaining performance obligations; 
 our plans to introduce new products; 
 loss or delay of expected purchases by our largest end-customers; 
 our expectations concerning relationships with third parties; 
 our expectations with respect to the realization of our tax assets and our unrecognized tax benefits; 
 our plans with respect to the repatriation of our earnings from our foreign operations; 
 our ability to maintain profitability while continuing to invest in our sales, marketing, product development, distribution channel programs and research and development teams; 
 our expectations regarding our future costs and expenses; 
 variability of our gross margin and the factors affecting it; 
 our expectations with respect to liquidity position and future capital requirements; 
 our stock repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividends; 
 our accounting policies and estimates; 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates; 
 the cost and potential outcomes of litigation; and 
 future acquisitions of or investments in complementary companies, products, services or technologies. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: execution risks related to closing key deals and improving our execution; the continued market adoption of our products; our ability to successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities; our timely development of new products and features; our ability to maintain profitability; any loss or delay of expected purchases by our largest end-customers; our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position; competitive and execution risks related to cloud-based computing trends; our ability to attract and retain new end-customers and our largest end-consumers; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation; changes demanded by our customers in the deployment and payment model for our products; continued growth in markets relating to networking and network security; the success of any future acquisitions or investments in complementary companies, products, services or technologies; the ability of our sales and other teams to execute well; our ability to shorten our close cycles; the ability of our channels to sell our products; variations in product mix or geographic locations of our sales; risks associated with our presence in international markets; any unforeseen need for capital which may require us to divert funds we may have otherwise used for the dividend program or stock repurchase program; a significant decline in global macroeconomic or political conditions that have an adverse impact on our business and financial results; business interruptions related to our supply chain; our ability to manage our business and expenses if customers cancel or delay orders; weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting; and our ability to timely file periodic reports required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as other risks identified in the Risk Factors section contained in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Any

forward-looking statements made by us in this report speak only as of the date of this report, and we do not intend to update these forward-looking statements after the filing of this report, except as required by law.

 secure application solutions; Thunder Application Delivery Controller ADC ), Lightning Application Delivery Controller Lightning ADC ), Thunder Carrier Grade Networking CGN ), Thunder Threat Protection System TPS ), Thunder SSL Insight SSLi and Thunder Convergent Firewall CFW ), and intelligent management and automation tools; Harmony Controller and aGalaxy TPS. Our solutions are available in a variety of form factors, such as optimized hardware appliances, bare metal software, containerized software, virtual appliances and cloud-native software. Our 7000+ customers span global large enterprises and communications, cloud and web service providers, and government organizations. 
 
 We derive revenue from two sources: (i) products revenue, which includes hardware, perpetual software license and subscription offerings, which include term-based license agreements; and (ii) services revenue, which includes post contract support PCS ), professional services, training and software-as-a-service offerings. Revenue for term-based license agreements is recognized at a point in time when the Company delivers the software license to the customer and over time once the subscription term has commenced. For our software-as-a-service offerings, our customers do not take possession of the Company s software but rather we provide access to the service via a hosting arrangement. Revenue in these arrangements is recognized over time as the services are provided. A substantial portion of our revenue is from sales of our products and services through distribution channels, such as resellers and distributors. Our customers predominantly purchase PCS services in conjunction with purchases of our products. We recognize services revenue ratably over the term of the PCS contract, which is typically one year, but can be up to seven years. 
 
 We sell our products globally to service providers and enterprises that depend on data center applications and networks to generate revenue and manage operations efficiently. We report two customer verticals: service providers and enterprises, and we report customer revenues in three broad geographic regions: the Americas, APJ and EMEA regions. The Americas region comprises the United States and other countries in the Americas (excluding the United States). The APJ region comprises Japan and other countries in Asia Pacific. The EMEA region comprises Europe, Middle East and Africa. We believe this geographic revenue view is consistent with how we evaluate our financial performance. 
 
 Our end-customers operate in a variety of industries, including telecommunications, technology, industrial, retail, financial, gaming, education and government. Since inception, our customer base has grown rapidly. 
 
 We sell substantially all of our solutions through our high-touch sales organization as well as distribution channels, including distributors, value-added resellers and system integrators, and fulfill nearly all orders globally through such channels. We believe this sales approach allows us to obtain the benefits of channel distribution, such as expanding our market coverage, while still maintaining face-to-face relationships with our end-customers. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to original design manufacturers. We perform quality assurance and testing at our San Jose, Taiwan and Japan distribution centers, as well as at our manufacturers locations.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations MD A should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. In addition to historical information, the MD A contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and other risk factors contained in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Overview 
 
 We are a leading provider of security and infrastructure solutions and services for on-premises, hybrid cloud and edge-cloud environments that enable a new generation of intelligently connected companies with the ability to continuously improve cyber protection and digital responsiveness across dynamic Information Technology IT and network infrastructures. Our product portfolio seeks to address many of the cyber protection challenges and solution requirements. The portfolio consists of six secure application solutions; Thunder Application Delivery Controller ADC ), Lightning Application Delivery Controller Lightning ADC ), Thunder Carrier Grade Networking CGN ), Thunder Threat Protection System TPS ), Thunder SSL Insight SSLi and Thunder Convergent Firewall CFW ), and two intelligent management and automation tools; Harmony Controller and aGalaxy TPS. Our solutions are available in a variety of form factors, such as optimized hardware appliances, bare metal software, containerized software, virtual appliances and cloud-native software. Our 7000+ customers span global large enterprises and communications, cloud and web service providers, and government organizations. 
 
 We derive revenue from two sources: (i) products revenue, which includes hardware, perpetual software license and subscription offerings, which include term-based license agreements; and (ii) services revenue, which includes post contract support PCS ), professional services, training and software-as-a-service offerings. Revenue for term-based license agreements is recognized at a point in time when the Company delivers the software license to the customer and over time once the subscription term has commenced. For our software-as-a-service offerings, our customers do not take possession of the Company s software but rather we provide access to the service via a hosting arrangement. Revenue in these arrangements is recognized over time as the services are provided. A substantial portion of our revenue is from sales of our products and services through distribution channels, such as resellers and distributors. Our customers predominantly purchase PCS services in conjunction with purchases of our products. We recognize services revenue ratably over the term of the PCS contract, which is typically one year, but can be up to seven years. 
 
 We sell our products globally to service providers and enterprises that depend on data center applications and networks to generate revenue and manage operations efficiently. We report two customer verticals: service providers and enterprises, and we report customer revenues in three broad geographic regions: the Americas, APJ and EMEA regions. The Americas region comprises the United States and other countries in the Americas (excluding the United States). The APJ region comprises Japan and other countries in Asia Pacific. The EMEA region comprises Europe, Middle East and Africa. We believe this geographic revenue view is consistent with how we evaluate our financial performance. 
 
 Our end-customers operate in a variety of industries, including telecommunications, technology, industrial, retail, financial, gaming, education and government. Since inception, our customer base has grown rapidly. 
 
 We sell substantially all of our solutions through our high-touch sales organization as well as distribution channels, including distributors, value-added resellers and system integrators, and fulfill nearly all orders globally through such channels. We believe this sales approach allows us to obtain the benefits of channel distribution, such as expanding our market coverage, while still maintaining face-to-face relationships with our end-customers. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to original design manufacturers. We perform quality assurance and testing at our San Jose, Taiwan and Japan distribution centers, as well as at our manufacturers locations. 
 
 24 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, (i) 51 of our total revenue was generated from the Americas region, of which 45 was generated from the United States and 6 was generated from the Americas-other, (ii) 34 from the APJ region and (iii) 14 from the EMEA region. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, (i) 45 of our total revenue was generated from the Americas region, of which 41 was generated from the United States and 4 was generated from the Americas-other, (ii) 37 from the APJ region and (iii) 19 from the EMEA region. One of our priorities is to strengthen our sales efforts in North America. Our enterprise customers accounted for 45 and 50 of our total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and our service provider customers accounted for 55 and 50 of our total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 As a result of the nature of our target market and the current stage of our development, a substantial portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of large customers, including service providers and enterprise customers, in any period. Purchases by our ten largest end-customers accounted for 44 and 29 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales to these large end-customers have typically been characterized by large but irregular purchases with long sales cycles. The timing of these purchases and the delivery of the purchased products are difficult to predict. Consequently, any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases by or deliveries to our largest customers could materially impact our revenue and operating results in any quarterly period. This may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and make them difficult to predict. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 78.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and 104.0 million of marketable securities. Cash provided by operating activities was 64.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 41.8 million in the same period of 2023. 
 
 We intend to continue to invest for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in our product development efforts to deliver new products and additional features in our current products to address customer needs. In addition, we may expand our global sales and marketing organizations, expand our distribution channel programs and increase awareness of our solutions on a global basis. Our investments in growth in these areas may affect our short-term profitability.

 Net Revenue 
 
 We derive revenue from two sources: (i) products revenue, which includes hardware, perpetual software license and subscription offerings, which include term-based license agreements; and (ii) services revenue, which includes post contract support PCS ), professional services, training and software-as-a-service offerings. 
 
 Our products revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our hardware appliances upon which our software is installed. Such software includes our ACOS software platform plus one or more of our ADC, CGN, TPS, SSLi or CFW solutions. Purchase of a hardware appliance includes a perpetual license to the included software. With respect to sales of our hardware appliances, we recognize products revenue upon transfer of control, generally at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Revenue for term-based license agreements is recognized at a point in time when we deliver the software license to the customer and the subscription term has commenced. As a percentage of revenue, our products revenue may vary from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the timing of orders and delivery of products, cyclicality and seasonality, changes in currency exchange rates and the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions. 
 
 We generate services revenue from sales of PCS, which is bundled with sales of products and technical services. We offer tiered PCS services under renewable, fee-based PCS contracts, primarily including technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, and software upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize services revenue ratably over the term of the PCS contract, which is typically one year, but can be up to seven years. For our software-as-a-service offerings, our customers do not take possession of our software but rather we provide access to the service via a hosting arrangement. Revenue in these arrangements is recognized over time as the services are provided. Additionally, an immaterial portion of our services revenue comes from subscription revenue. We offer several services by subscription, primarily through either term-based license agreements or as a service through our cloud-based platform.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Amount Percent Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 61,678 64,526 (2,848) (4.4) Research and development 44,533 43,250 1,283 3.0 General and administrative 19,188 18,177 1,011 5.6 Total operating expenses 125,399 125,953 (554) (0.4) 
 Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses are our largest functional category of operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include the cost of marketing programs, trade shows, consulting services, promotional materials, demonstration equipment, depreciation and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs. 
 
 Sales and marketing operating expenses decreased 0.3 million, or 1.5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and decreased 2.8 million, or 4.4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs. 
 
 For the full year 2024, we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease from 2023 levels as we apply a disciplined approach to focus our investments in areas that offer the greatest opportunities. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development efforts are focused on new product development and on developing additional functionality for our existing products. These expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, and, to a lesser extent, prototype materials, 
 32 

depreciation and certain allocated facilities and information technology infrastructure costs. We expense research and development costs as incurred. 
 
 Research and development operating expenses decreased 1.9 million, or 10.5 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and increased 1.3 million, or 3.0 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to fluctuations in personnel costs. 
 
 For the full year 2024, we expect research and development expenses to increase from 2023 levels reflecting strategic investments in our growth priorities, including cybersecurity technology. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, professional services and office expenses. General and administrative personnel costs include executive, finance, human resources, information technology, facility and legal related expenses. Professional services primarily consist of fees for outside accounting, tax, external legal counsel (including litigation), recruiting and other administrative services. 
 
 General and administrative operating expenses increased 0.9 million, or 15.7 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, and increased 1.1 million, or 5.6 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs. 
 
 For the full year 2024, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase modestly from 2023 levels as we apply a disciplined approach to focus our investments in areas that offer the greatest opportunities. 

Non-Operating Income, Net 
 
 Non-Operating income, net, consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, foreign currency exchange gains and losses and fair value adjustments on investments in publicly held equity securities. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily a result of fluctuations in the Japanese Yen versus the U.S. Dollar. 
 
 Non-operating income, net, had a favorable change of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The favorable change was primarily driven by fair value adjustment gains of 0.9 million and foreign exchange gains of 0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest income of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Non-operating income, net, had a favorable change of 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The favorable change was primarily driven by a favorable change in foreign exchange gains and losses of 3.0 million, fair value adjustment gains of 2.0 million and an increase in interest income of 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. 

Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 We recorded a provision for income tax of 1.8 million and a benefit for income tax of 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and we recorded a provision for income tax expense of 4.8 million and 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s income tax provision and benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily consisted of U.S. federal and state taxes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 78.1 million, including 2.9 million held outside the United States in our foreign subsidiaries, and 104.0 million of marketable securities. We currently do not have any plans to repatriate our earnings from our foreign operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 156.8 million, accumulated deficit of 58.6 million and total stockholders equity of 217.3 million. Our marketable securities are highly liquid and are classified as available for sale should the Company decide to quickly raise cash at any time in the future. 
 
 33 

We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth, and our investment may increase. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 The Company s Board of Directors (the Board has authorized various stock repurchase programs from time to time, including a twelve-month 50 million program approved on November 1, 2022 (the 2022 Program ), a twelve-month 50 million program approved November 7, 2023 (the 2023 Program and a 50 million program approved November 7, 2024 (the 2024 Program ). Under all programs, repurchased shares are held in treasury at cost. The Company s stock repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. Shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Through December 31, 2023, the Company had repurchased 1.2 million shares for a total cost of 15.7 million under the 2022 Program. Through September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total cost of 24.6 million under the 2023 Program. 
 
 In October 2021, our Board approved the initiation of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid cash dividends of 0.06 per share outstanding, for a total of 4.5 million and 13.4 million, respectively, as a return of capital. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid cash dividends of 0.06 per share outstanding, for a total of 4.4 million 13.4 million, respectively, as a return of capital. The next dividend, in the amount of 0.06 per share, will be paid on December 2, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2024 as a return of capital. We currently anticipate that we will continue to pay comparable quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment, amount and timing of future dividends remain within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, and other factors. 
 
 As described in Part II Item 1, Legal Proceedings of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, from time to time we are involved in ongoing litigation. Any adverse settlements or judgments in any litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash balances and cash flows in the period in which such events occur. 
 
 Statements of Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flow related activities (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 64,782 41,783 Investing activities (48,192) 13,443 Financing activities (35,771) (19,045) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (19,181) 36,181 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash provided by operating activities is driven primarily by sales of our products and management of working capital investments. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel-related expenditures, manufacturing costs, marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 cash provided by operating activities was 64.8 million, consisting of net income of 31.8 million, non-cash charges of 19.5 million and an increase in cash resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of 13.4 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expenses of 8.2 million and stock-based compensation expense of 12.3 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects cash inflows from the changes in accounts receivable of 8.4 million, accrued liabilities of 5.1 million, deferred revenue of 2.9 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.8 million, partially offset by cash outflows from inventory of 1.9 million and accounts payable of 1.8 million. 
 34 

The favorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. The favorable change in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in accrued variable compensation. The unfavorable change in inventory was attributable to the timing of product shipments. The unfavorable change in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of payments to vendors. The unfavorable change in prepaid expenses and other assets was attributable to an increase in prepaid state and federal taxes. The unfavorable change in deferred revenue was attributable to the timing of service contract bookings. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was 41.8 million, consisting of net income of 22.1 million and non-cash charges of 18.8 million and an increase in cash resulting from the net change in operating assets and liabilities of 0.9 million. Our non-cash charges consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization expenses of 6.8 million and stock-based compensation expense of 11.2 million. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities primarily reflects cash inflows from the changes in accrued receivable of 14.1 million, deferred revenue of 8.7 million and prepaid expenses and other assets of 2.0 million, partially offset by cash outflows from changes in accrued liabilities of 17.4 million, inventory of 5.3 million and accounts payable of 1.2 million. 
 
 The unfavorable change in accrued liabilities was attributed to variable cash compensation accruals. The unfavorable change in inventory was attributable to the timing of product shipments. The unfavorable change in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of payments to vendors. The favorable change in deferred revenue was attributable to the timing of service contract bookings. The favorable change in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to the release and return of a security deposit. The favorable change in accounts receivable was attributed to timing of billing and cash collections. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 48.2 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of 127.3 million and capital expenditures of 9.9 million, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of 89.0 million. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by investing activities was 13.4 million, consisting of maturities and sales of marketable securities of 96.3 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of 75.1 million and capital expenditures of 7.8 million. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 35.8 million and primarily consisting of 24.3 million used for repurchases of common stock and 13.4 million used for cash dividend payments, partially offset by 1.9 million of proceeds from common stock issued under the Company s equity plans. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was 19.0 million and primarily consisting of 13.4 million used for cash dividend payments and 8.7 million used for repurchases of common stock, partially offset by 3.0 million of proceeds from common stock issued under the Company s equity plans. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 Our contractual obligations consist of non-cancellable operating lease arrangements and totaled 13.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Our operating lease arrangements expire on various dates through July 2027. These arrangements require us to pay certain operating expenses, such as taxes, repairs and insurance, and contain renewal and escalation clauses. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 
 35 

The Company s critical accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in Part II Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Our condensed consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. Dollars, with the most significant exception being Japan where we invoice primarily in Japanese Yen. Our costs and expenses are generally denominated in the currencies where our operations are located, which is primarily in the Americas, EMEA and, to a lesser extent, Japan and the Asia Pacific region. We have a hedging program with respect to foreign currency risk. Revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs and expenses incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can affect our revenue and operating income. As exchange rates vary, operating income may differ from expectations. 
 
 The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to remeasurement are recorded in interest and other income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. A significant fluctuation in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries local currencies, especially the Japanese Yen, British Pound and Euro, and the U.S. Dollar could have an adverse impact on our condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
 
 We recorded 1.3 million and 3.8 million of net foreign exchange gains during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We recorded 0.9 million and 0.8 million of net foreign exchange gains during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effect of a hypothetical 10 change in our exchange rate would not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketable securities. Our marketable securities are typically comprised of corporate securities, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and equity securities of publicly traded companies. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio included marketable securities with an aggregate amortized cost basis of 98.9 million and a fair value of 104.0 million. Fair value includes 4.6 million for our investment in publicly held equity securities. The effect of a hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest expense. 
 
 The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our marketable securities assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points BPS ), 100 BPS and 150 BPS as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 
 Fair Value as of (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 9/30/2024 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Marketable securities 105,035 104,704 104,374 104,043 103,713 103,382 103,051 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Management s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means 
 36 

controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits to the SEC, under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to enable timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, and that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, and in conformity with U.S. GAAP, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
 
 37 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 We have been and may currently be involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 On November 7, 2023, we announced that our Board authorized a new 50 million share repurchase program, the 2023 Program, under which we may repurchase up to 50 million of our outstanding common stock during the next 12 months. Under the 2023 Program, we may repurchase shares of common stock in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, in block trades or a combination of the foregoing. We are not obligated under the 2023 Program to repurchase any specific number or dollar amount of shares of common stock, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the 2023 Program at any time. Our management and Board will determine the timing and amount of any repurchase in its discretion based on a variety of factors, such as the market price of our common stock, corporate requirements, general market economic conditions and legal requirements. The Company plans to fund repurchases from its existing cash balance and cash provided by operating activities. 
 
 Share repurchase activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts): Periods Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) July 1 - 31, 2024 2 13.72 2 34,800 August 1 - 31, 2024 743 12.64 743 25,405 September 1 - 30, 2024 2 13.45 2 25,381 Total 747 25,381 
 
 (1) The 25,381 thousand in the table above represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the 2023 Program as of September 30, 2024. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION
