million (the Upfront Payment under the Cipla Agreement. Upon
receipt of the Upfront Payment, the Company irrevocably assigned to Cipla the following assets, solely to the extent that each covers
the Product in connection with any treatment, prevention, and/or diagnosis of diseases of the pulmonary system Pulmonary Indications ):
all existing and future technologies, current and future drug master files, dossiers, third-party contracts, regulatory filings, regulatory
materials and regulatory approvals, patents, and intellectual property rights, as well as any other associated rights and assets directly
related to the Product, specifically in relation to Pulmonary Indications (collectively, the Assigned Assets ), excluding
most specifically the Company s iSPERSE technology. A portion of the Upfront Payment was deposited by
the Company into a bank account, along with an equal amount from the Company, and was dedicated to the development of the Product (the
 Initial Development Funding ). The Initial Development Funding was depleted during the year ended December 31, 2021, at
which point the Company and Cipla each became responsible for a portion of the development costs actually incurred as described below
(the Co-Development Phase ). 

Pursuant
to the Third Amendment, the Company and Cipla agreed that, during the period commencing on January 6, 2024 and ending July 30, 2024 (the
 Wind Down Period ), the Company would complete all Phase 2b activities, assign or license all patents to Cipla and their
registration with the appropriate authorities in regions other than the United States, complete a physical and demonstrable technology
transfer and secure all data from the Phase 2b study for inclusion in the safety database. The Company shared costs with Cipla during
the Wind Down Period in the same proportions in effect with the Second Amendment discussed above, but subject to a maximum reimbursement
amount by Cipla as approved by the joint steering committee. The Company completed all Phase 2b activities by the end of the Wind Down
Period. The Company is in the process of settling certain final bills with its PUR1900 contractors, which together comprise an immaterial
balance recorded within accounts payable as of September 30, 2024. 

Accounting
Treatment 

The
Company originally concluded that because both it and Cipla are active participants in the arrangement and are exposed to the significant
risks and rewards of the collaboration, the Company s collaboration with Cipla is within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ASC 808 ). The Company concluded that Cipla is a customer since
they contracted with the Company to obtain research and development services and a license to the Assigned Assets, each of which is an
output of the Company s ordinary activities, in exchange for consideration. Therefore, the Company has applied the guidance in
ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 to account for the research and development services and
a license within the contract. The Company determined that the research and development services and license to the Assigned Assets are
considered highly interdependent and highly interrelated and therefore are considered a single combined performance obligation because
Cipla cannot benefit from the license without the performance by the Company of the research and development services. Such research
and development services are highly specialized and proprietary to the Company and therefore not available to Cipla from any other third
party. 

The
Company initially determined the total transaction price to be million comprised of million for research and development
services for the Product and million for the irrevocable license to the Assigned Assets. Any consideration related to the Co-Development
Phase was not initially included in the transaction price as such amounts were subject to the variable consideration constraint. Additionally,
the Company has fully constrained any transaction price that might be realized upon commercialization. 

Revenue
is recognized for the Cipla Agreement as the research and development services are provided using an input method, according to the ratio
of costs incurred to the total costs expected to be incurred in the future to satisfy the Company s obligations. In management s
judgment, this input method is the best measure of the transfer of control of the combined performance obligation. The amounts received
that have not yet been recognized as revenue are recorded in deferred revenue on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, with
amounts expected to be recognized in the next 12 months recorded as current. 

The
Company concluded that the Third Amendment is a contract modification that should be accounted for as part of the existing contract.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, in revenue
related to the research and development services and irrevocable license to the Assigned Assets in the Company s consolidated statements
of operations, as compared to million and million, respectively, recognized during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023. The revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily associated with the cumulative catch-up
recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2024, from the contract modification, that had been included in deferred revenue at the
beginning of the period. As of September 30, 2024, all of the Company s performance obligations have been satisfied. 

Agreements
with MannKind Corporation MannKind 

On
May 28, 2024, the Company executed certain agreements with MannKind and the Company s landlord (collectively, the MannKind
Transaction ), all of which closed during July 2024. The agreements with MannKind included a Bill of Sale and Assignment Agreement
(the Bill of Sale with respect to the assignment of the Company s rental facility at 36 Crosby Drive, Bedford, Massachusetts
(the Bedford Facility to MannKind along with the transfer of all leasehold improvements, laboratory equipment and other
related personal property. In connection with the assignment of the Bedford Facility, the Company, MannKind and Cobalt Propco 2020, LLC
(the Landlord entered into an Amendment to Lease and Consent to Assignment of Lease (the Lease Assignment Agreement pursuant to that certain Lease Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2022 (the Lease Agreement ), by and between the Company
and the Landlord. Pursuant to the Lease Assignment Agreement, MannKind assumed all of the Company s obligations under the Lease
Agreement, including all rent and other payments. 

In
connection with these transactions, the Company and MannKind entered into an Intellectual Property Cross License Agreement (the Cross
License Agreement ). Pursuant to the Cross License Agreement, the Company granted to MannKind (i) an exclusive license to develop,
use, manufacture, market, offer and sell iSPERSE formulations of Clofazimine, (ii) an exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture,
market, offer and sell formulations of iSPERSE with one more active pharmaceutical ingredients for the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacteria
lung disease in humans, (iii) an exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, market, offer and sell iSPERSE formulations of insulin,
(iv) a non-exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, market, offer and sell formulations of iSPERSE with one more active pharmaceutical
ingredients for the treatment of endocrine disease in humans, and (v) a non-exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, market, offer
and sell formulations of iSPERSE with one more active pharmaceutical ingredients for the treatment of interstitial lung diseases (including
IPF, PPF and other related lung diseases) in humans (collectively, the Out-License ). 

Additionally,
pursuant to the Cross License Agreement, MannKind granted to the Company (i) the exclusive right to develop, use, manufacture, market,
offer and sell its single-use disposable dry powder inhaler (including all modifications or improvement thereto made by or on behalf
of the Company, the Cricket Device for the inhaled delivery of dihydroergotamine in any formulation whatsoever, including
the Company s PUR3100 treatment of acute migraine and (ii) a non-exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, market, offer
and sell the Cricket Device for the inhaled delivery of one more active pharmaceutical ingredients formulated with iSPERSE for the treatment
of neurological disease in humans (collectively, the In-License ). 

Additionally,
pursuant to the Master Services Agreement, by and between the Company and MannKind, MannKind shall provide certain development services
to the Company, including but not limited to, activities to develop a dry powder formulation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient
that the Company provides to MannKind for oral inhalation using iSPERSE. 

To
maintain continuity of iSPERSE platform knowledge, MannKind hired certain members of the Company s research and development staff
in July 2024. 

Accounting
Treatment 

The
Company determined that the MannKind Transaction represents a combined agreement for accounting purposes, as the individual components
have the same overall commercial objectives and the consideration under each component is dependent on the other components. 

The
consideration due to the Company in the MannKind Transaction consists solely of the non-cash consideration in the form of the In-License.
The fair value of the non-cash consideration received should be allocated to the other components of the MannKind Transaction to determine
the consideration received for the other components. The Company determined that the fair value of the In-License is immaterial given
that adequate alternative inhaler devices are already available on the market (and indeed, the Company has already established use of
another third-party inhalation device in their PUR3100 Phase 1 trial that performed well as a DHE delivery device as reported in a peer-reviewed
publication), and considering optional purchases of Cricket Devices are at market prices. Accordingly, the consideration allocated to
other components of the MannKind Transaction was immaterial. 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company accounted for the Lease Assignment Agreement upon execution as a lease modification
that reduced the lease term to the assignment date in July 2024. Accordingly, the Company remeasured its operating lease liability as
of the modification date to reflect the decrease in fixed lease payments, with the amount of the remeasurement, million, adjusted
by a corresponding reduction to the right-of-use asset. 

The
Company determined that its operating lease right-of-use asset and property and equipment subject to the Bill of Sale represented a disposal
group that became held for sale during the second quarter of 2024 and remained classified as held for sale as of June 30, 2024. The Company
recorded a full write-down of the disposal group s carrying value as of June 30, 2024, in the amount of million. Upon the
closing of the MannKind Transaction in July 2024, the disposal group was disposed. 

Concurrent
with the closing of the MannKind Transaction, the Company terminated and MannKind hired the majority of the Company s research
and development employees, representing approximately two-thirds of the Company s workforce at the time. The Company agreed to
provide termination benefits to these employees, which has been fully paid as of September 30, 2024. 

million of the
Company s shares of common stock, from time to time in an at-the-market public offering (the ATM Offering ). Upon
filing of the Annual Report, the Company continued to be subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, pursuant to which in no event
will . Therefore, the amount that may
be able to be raised using the ATM Offering will be significantly less than , until such time as the Company s public
float held by non-affiliates exceeds 75,000,000. 

Sales
of common stock under the Sales Agreement are made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was filed
with the SEC on May 17, 2024, and subsequently declared effective on May 30, 2024 (File No. 333-279491), and a related prospectus. HCW
acts as the Company s sales agent on a commercially reasonable efforts basis, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices
and applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations and the rules of The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq ). If expressly
authorized by the Company, HCW may also sell the Company s common stock in privately negotiated transactions. There is no specific
date on which the ATM Offering will end, there are no minimum sale requirements and there are no arrangements to place any of the proceeds
of the ATM Offering in an escrow, trust or similar account. HCW is entitled to compensation at a fixed commission rate of of the
gross proceeds from the sale of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares of the Company s common stock were sold under the Sales Agreement. 

warrants issued or exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share expired. The following

additional awards may be granted. As of September 30, 2024, the two legacy plans have a total of options outstanding, all of which
are fully vested and for which common stock will be issued upon exercise.

shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share expired. 

stock options were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company records stock-based compensation expense related
to stock options based on their grant-date fair value. As of September 30, 2024, there was an immaterial amount of unrecognized stock-based
compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under the Company s stock award plans.

Management
of the Company evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets and determined
that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. As a result, a full valuation
allowance was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The
Company applies ASC 740, Income Taxes , for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions for which reserves
have been established. A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company s deferred tax assets, so that the effect
of the unrecognized tax benefits is to reduce the gross amount of the deferred tax asset and the corresponding valuation allowance. The
Company has no material uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Overview 

Business 

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel inhaled therapeutic products intended to prevent and
treat respiratory and other diseases with important unmet medical needs using our patented iSPERSE technology. Our
proprietary product pipeline includes treatments for central nervous system CNS disorders such as acute migraine and
serious lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ABPA ). Our product candidates are based on our proprietary engineered dry powder delivery platform, iSPERSE ,
which seeks to improve therapeutic delivery to the lungs by optimizing pharmacokinetics and reducing systemic side effects to improve
patient outcomes. 

We
design and develop inhaled therapeutic products based on our proprietary dry powder delivery technology, iSPERSE , which
enables delivery of small or large molecule drugs to the lungs by inhalation for local or systemic applications. The iSPERSE 
 powders are engineered to be small, dense particles with highly efficient dispersibility and delivery to airways. iSPERSE 
 powders can be used with an array of dry powder inhaler technologies and can be formulated with a broad range of drug substances
including small molecules and biologics. We believe the iSPERSE dry powder technology offers enhanced drug loading
and delivery efficiency that outperforms traditional lactose-blend inhaled dry powder therapies. 

Our
goal is to develop breakthrough therapeutic products that are safe, convenient, and more effective than the existing therapeutic products
for respiratory and other diseases where iSPERSE properties are advantageous. 

Our
current pipeline of clinical assets is aligned to this goal as we develop iSPERSE -based therapeutic candidates which
target the prevention and treatment of a range of diseases, including CNS disorders and pulmonary diseases. These therapeutic candidates
include PUR3100 for the treatment of acute migraine, PUR1800 for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease AECOPD ), and PUR1900 for the treatment of ABPA in patients with asthma and in patients with cystic fibrosis CF ).
Each program is enabled by its unique iSPERSE formulation designed to achieve specific therapeutic objectives. 

Contingent
on securing additional funding, we intend to capitalize on our iSPERSE technology platform and our expertise in inhaled
therapeutics to identify new product candidates for the prevention and treatment of diseases, including those with considerable unmet
medical needs, and to build our product pipeline beyond our existing candidates. In order to advance clinical trials for our therapeutic
candidates and leverage the iSPERSE platform to enable delivery of partnered compounds, we intend to form strategic
alliances with third parties, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic or private research institutes. 

17 

Contingent
on securing additional funding, we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses and operating losses for at least the next several
years based on our drug development plans and in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 

Pursue further clinical
 studies for PUR3100, an orally inhaled dihydroergotamine DHE including a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment
 of acute migraine, contingent on securing financing or partnership arrangements. We received Food and Drug Administration FDA acceptance of our Investigational New Drug Application IND and a study may proceed letter in September
 2023, positioning PUR3100 as Phase 2-ready for potential financing or partnership discussions. 

We developed PUR3100, an
 iSPERSE formulation of DHE in 2020. We completed good laboratory practice GLP toxicology studies
 in 2021 and 2022. In 2022, we completed a Phase 1 study designed as a double-blinded trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and
 pharmacokinetics of three dose levels of single doses of inhaled PUR3100 with intravenous IV placebo, as compared
 to IV DHE (DHE mesylate injection) with inhaled placebo. 

On
 January 4, 2023, we announced the Phase 1 topline results, indicating that PUR3100 was safe and tolerated with fewer gastrointestinal
 side effects in all doses compared to IV DHE. PUR3100 showed a five-minute T max and C max within the targeted
 therapeutic range for all three doses tested. The Phase 1 study data was presented at the American Headache Society 65 th 
 Annual Meeting in June 2023. In May 2024, we announced a peer-reviewed publication of Phase 1 clinical results in the publication
 Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain . 
 
 In
 September 2023, we announced the FDA s acceptance of an IND application for PUR3100 and receipt of a study may proceed 
 letter for a Phase 2 study. The IND includes a Phase 2 clinical protocol where safety and preliminary efficacy of PUR3100 will be
 investigated in patients with acute migraine. 
 
 Based
 on the rapid systemic exposure in the therapeutic range and the improved side effect profile relative to IV dosing, we believe the
 PUR3100 formulation of DHE may differentiate from approved DHE products or those in development. If effectiveness is demonstrated,
 PUR3100 may offer the convenience of being self-administered with a pharmacokinetic profile that may potentially provide rapid onset
 of action. 

Pursue partnership or
 other alternatives to monetize or advance PUR1800, focusing on the development of an orally inhaled kinase inhibitor for treatment
 of AECOPD. 

We completed preclinical
 safety studies for PUR1800, our iSPERSE formulation of RV1162, in 2018 and advanced our formulation and
 process development efforts to support clinical testing in stable moderate-severe COPD patients. We completed a Phase 1b safety,
 tolerability, and pharmacokinetics clinical study of PUR1800 for subjects with stable moderate-severe COPD and received topline data
 from the Phase 1b clinical study in the first quarter of 2022. We analyzed data from the completed Phase 1b clinical study of PUR1800
 for AECOPD and presented study results at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma Immunology (AAAAI) conference in the first
 quarter of 2023. The results indicated PUR1800 was safe and well tolerated with no observed safety signals. The topline data, along
 with the results from chronic toxicology studies, support the continued development of PUR1800 for the treatment of AECOPD and other
 inflammatory respiratory diseases. 

Capitalize on our proprietary
 iSPERSE technology and our expertise in inhaled therapeutics and particle engineering to identify new product candidates
 for prevention and treatment of diseases, including those with important unmet medical needs . 

To add additional inhaled
 therapeutics to our development pipeline and facilitate additional collaborations, we are leveraging our iSPERSE technology
 and our expertise in inhaled therapeutics and particle engineering to identify potential product candidates. 

Invest in protecting
 and expanding our intellectual property portfolio and file for additional patents to strengthen our intellectual property rights. 

18 

The status of our patent
 portfolio changes frequently in the ordinary course of patent prosecution. As of September 30, 2024, our patent portfolio related
 to iSPERSE included approximately 147 granted patents, 18 of which are granted US patents, with expiration
 dates from 2024 to 2037, and approximately 51 additional pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. Our in-licensed
 portfolio related to kinase inhibitors included approximately 280 granted patents, 33 of which are granted US patents, with expiration
 dates from 2029 to 2035, and approximately 18 additional pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. We have national
 phase applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia,
 and the United States that cover certain formulations and methods of use relevant to our PUR3100 program. 

Seek partnerships and
 license agreements to support the product development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

In order to advance our
 clinical programs, we may seek partners or licensees in areas of pharmaceutical and clinical development. 

Position the Company
 to be able to consider strategic alternatives. 

Continue our cost saving
 measures which have included the wind down of the Phase 2b study for PUR1900 and the assignment of our long-term lease of our Bedford
 facility pursuant to those certain agreements by and between us, MannKind Corporation MannKind and Cobalt Propco
 2020, LLC (the MannKind Transaction to conserve our cash resources as we consider strategic alternatives for the Company.

Therapeutic
Candidates 

PUR3100 

In
2020, we developed PUR3100, the iSPERSE formulation of DHE, for the treatment of acute migraine. Currently DHE is only
available as subcutaneous, intravenous infusion or intranasal delivery. If approved for commercialization, PUR3100 has the opportunity
to be the first orally inhaled DHE treatment for acute migraine and be an alternative to other acute therapies. Given the oral inhaled
route of delivery, PUR3100 is anticipated to provide relief from the rapid onset of migraine symptoms and provide a favorable tolerability
profile. 

A
total of three 14-day GLP toxicology studies have been completed with PUR3100 to support single-dose clinical studies. We are planning
to conduct a chronic toxicology study to support long-term dosing. Based on discussions with the FDA, this would complete the non-clinical
requirements to support a new drug application NDA ). 

Our
interactions with the FDA have indicated that, in addition to the planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, long-term safety should be assessed
in a minimum of one hundred patients for six months of dosing and fifty patients for twelve months of dosing. The FDA also confirmed
that it will be necessary to perform a safety study administering PUR3100 to otherwise healthy patients with asthma before an NDA is
submitted. 

On
September 26, 2022, we announced the completion of patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical study, performed in Australia. The study design
was a double-dummy, double-blinded trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of three dose levels of single doses
of inhaled PUR3100 with IV placebo, as compared to IV DHE (DHE mesylate injection) with inhaled placebo. This study may also provide
preliminary comparative bioavailability data to support the use of the 505(b)(2) pathway for marketing authorization. Twenty-six healthy
subjects were enrolled and each of the four groups contained at least six subjects. 

On
January 4, 2023, we announced topline results. We presented the Phase 1 study data at the American Headache Society 65 th Annual
Meeting in June 2023. The study showed that PUR3100 achieved peak exposures in the targeted therapeutic range and time to maximum concentration
occurred at five minutes after dosing at all dosing levels. The PUR3100 dose groups also showed a lower incidence of nausea and no vomiting
compared to observations of nausea and vomiting in the IV administered DHE dose group. 

19 

Based
on the rapid systemic exposure in the therapeutic range and the improved side effect profile relative to IV dosing, we believe the PUR3100
formulation of DHE may differentiate from approved DHE products or those known to be in development. If effectiveness is demonstrated,
PUR3100 may offer the convenience of being self-administered with a pharmacokinetic profile that may potentially provide rapid onset
of action. 

In
September 2023, we announced that the FDA accepted the PUR3100 IND and the receipt of a study may proceed letter for the
clinical study: A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single Event Study to Evaluate the Safety,
Tolerability, and Efficacy of PUR3100 (Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Inhalation Powder) in the Acute Treatment of Migraine . We anticipate
that this Phase 2 clinical study will initiate once financing or partnership arrangements have been made. 

On
May 15, 2024, we announced publication of, Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single orally inhaled dose of PUR3100,
a dry powder formulation of dihydroergotamine versus intravenous dihydroergotamine: A Phase 1 randomized, double-blind study in healthy
adults in the peer-reviewed publication Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain . 

We
believe that in this trial, PUR3100 demonstrated the potential for rapid pain relief and improved DHE tolerability versus IV DHE. With
a T max of 5 minutes and a C max in the therapeutic window for all doses tested, we believe that PUR3100 has the
potential to address an unmet need for acute migraine sufferers and we are pursuing different options to advance PUR3100 into a Phase
2 clinical trial to further investigate its promising profile in treating acute migraine. 

The
completed Phase 1 study demonstrated optimal pharmacokinetics and improved tolerability of PUR3100 compared to IV DHE. The Phase 1 trial
was a randomized, double-dummy, double-blinded design to assesses the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of three dose groups
treated with inhaled PUR3100 with intravenous (IV) placebo, compared to a single dose of IV DHE (DHE mesylate injection) with inhaled
placebo in healthy volunteers. All doses of PUR3100 were generally well tolerated with a lower incidence of nausea (21 vs. 86 ), vomiting
(0 vs. 29 ), and headache (16 vs. 57 compared to IV DHE. The PK profile of PUR3100 versus IV DHE was characterized by a similar mean
time to C max (5 vs. 5.5 min), with reduced AUC0 2h (1120 4320 vs. 6340), and a lower C max (3620 14,400
vs. 45,000). All doses of PUR3100 were associated with mean C max above the minimum level required to achieve efficacy (1000
pg/mL). 

Over
39 million patients suffer from migraine in the United States and there is currently no orally inhaled DHE treatment option for patients.
PUR3100 is our orally inhaled therapeutic candidate formulation of DHE engineered with iSPERSE for the treatment of acute migraine.
Pulmatrix is currently looking at opportunities to finance or partner PUR3100 to initiate a potential Phase 2 clinical study. 

PUR1800 

Reduced
responsiveness to corticosteroids represents an important barrier to effective treatment of COPD and AECOPD and provides a clear rationale
to seek novel medicines to treat these respiratory diseases. In addition, current treatments generally fail to treat the underlying source
of the AECOPD, in particular when a viral or bacterial infection is the cause, which occurs in approximately 80 of exacerbations. RV1162,
the active ingredient of PUR1800, is a novel, potent anti-inflammatory that inhibits the phosphorylation of a narrow spectrum of kinases.
In pre-clinical studies, RV1162 demonstrated direct anti-inflammatory activity in a model of viral induced respiratory inflammation.
RV1162 also demonstrated a reduction in corticosteroid-resistant inflammatory responses in a model of cigarette smoke induced inflammation.
These findings suggested that RV1162 has the potential to deliver effective anti-inflammatory outcomes in corticosteroid-resistant patients
while also reducing the underlying source of inflammation in an exacerbation, such as a viral and/or bacterial respiratory infection. 

Clinical
studies conducted by RespiVert/Janssen with RV1162 formulated as a lactose blend for inhalation demonstrated that the molecule was well
tolerated for up to 14 days of dosing in patients with COPD. Analysis of sputum collected from patients with COPD treated with RV1162
showed reduced levels of p38 phosphorylation in sputum cells and decreases in the number of neutrophils recovered in sputum after 12
days of dosing. These findings suggest that inhalation of RV1162 may confer anti-inflammatory benefits after a short dosing regimen.
Long-term toxicology studies with RV1162 as a lactose blend suggested that this formulation was not suitable for chronic dosing. 

20 

Based
upon the clinical results generated by RespiVert/Janssen for RV1162 and the anticipated benefits of an iSPERSE 
formulation of RV1162, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with RespiVert Ltd. RespiVert ),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Janssen Biotech, Inc. on June 9, 2017. RespiVert granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in a portfolio
of narrow spectrum kinase inhibitor compounds NSKI ). We subsequently formulated RV1162 into PUR1800 for development as
a potential therapy for AECOPD. 

We
completed a Phase 1b safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PUR1800 for patients with stable moderate-severe COPD. Topline data
was delivered in the first quarter of 2022 and presented at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology conference in the
first quarter of 2023. 

The
clinical study, performed at the Medicines Evaluation Unit in Manchester, UK, was a randomized, three-way crossover double-blind study
with 14 days of daily dosing, which included placebo and one of two doses of PUR1800, and included a 28-day follow-up period after each
treatment period. A total of 18 adults with stable COPD were enrolled. Safety and tolerability, as well as systemic pharmacokinetics PK were evaluated. 

PUR1800
was well tolerated and there were no observed safety signals. The PK data indicate that PUR1800 results in low and consistent systemic
exposure when administered via oral inhalation. The topline data, along with the results from chronic toxicology studies, support the
continued development of PUR1800 for the treatment of AECOPD and other inflammatory respiratory diseases. These data will inform the
design of a potential Phase 2 study in the treatment of AECOPD. 

PUR1900 

PUR1900
is our iSPERSE inhaled formulation of itraconazole, an antifungal drug commercially available as an oral drug. We developed
PUR1900 for the prevention and treatment of fungal infections and allergic/hypersensitivity reactions to fungus in patients with severe
lung disease, including those with asthma and CF. 

On
April 15, 2019, we entered into the Cipla Agreement with Cipla for the co-development and commercialization, on a worldwide, except for
the Cipla Territory defined below, exclusive basis, of PUR1900, our inhaled iSPERSE enabled formulation of the
antifungal drug itraconazole, which is only available as an oral drug, for the treatment of all pulmonary indications, including ABPA
in patients with asthma. We entered into the Second Amendment to the Cipla Agreement on November 8, 2021 and the Third Amendment on January
6, 2024. All references to the Cipla Agreement herein refer to the Cipla Agreement, as amended. The Cipla Agreement will remain in effect
in perpetuity, unless otherwise earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. 

Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the definition of
the Cipla Territory , has been expanded to include all markets other than the United States. 

Pursuant
to the Third Amendment, all development and commercialization activities with respect to the Product in all markets other than the United
States (the Cipla Territory will be conducted exclusively by Cipla at Cipla s sole cost and expense, and Cipla shall
be entitled to all profits from the sale of the Product in the Cipla Territory, except that we will receive 2 royalties on any potential
future net sales by Cipla outside the United States. 

Pursuant
to the Third Amendment, we and Cipla stopped patient enrollment for the ongoing Phase 2b clinical study. We agreed that during the period commencing on January 6, 2024 and ending July 30, 2024 (the Wind
Down Period ), we would complete all Phase 2b activities, assign or license all patents to Cipla and their registration with the appropriate
authorities in the Cipla Territory, complete a physical and demonstrable technology transfer and secure all data from the Phase 2b study
for inclusion in the safety database for the Cipla Territory. 

For
the duration of the Wind Down Period, we and Cipla were each responsible for 60 and 40 , respectively, of our Direct Costs. We shared
all other development costs with Cipla that are not Direct Costs, such as the cost of clinical research organizations, manufacturing
costs and other third-party costs, on a 50/50 basis. Reimbursements from Cipla to us for these costs were subject to a maximum reimbursement
amount as approved by the joint steering committee. 

21 

We
completed all Phase 2b wind down activities within the third quarter of 2024. As such, we no longer bear further financial responsibility for the commercialization and development with respect to the Product in the Cipla Territory,
with such commercialization and development expenses of the Product in the Cipla Territory to be borne at Cipla s sole cost and
expense after January 6, 2024. We will receive 2 royalties on any potential future net sales by Cipla outside the United States. Within
the United States, we and Cipla will seek to monetize PUR1900, our inhaled iSPERSE formulation of the antifungal drug itraconazole
for indications where an orally inhaled antifungal may provide a therapeutic benefit or fulfill an unmet medical need. 

Financial
Overview 

Revenues 

To
date, we have not generated any product sales. The revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily
generated from the Cipla Agreement as related to our PUR1900 program, for which wind down activities have been completed. 

For
more discussion on the Cipla Agreement, please see Note 6, Significant Agreements , to our condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the research and development of our preclinical and clinical candidates,
and include: 

employee-related expenses,
 including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; 

expenses incurred under
 agreements with contract research organizations CROs or contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ),
 and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical activities; 

the cost of acquiring,
 developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials and lab supplies; 

facility, depreciation
 and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent, maintenance of our facility, insurance and other supplies;

costs associated with preclinical
 activities and clinical regulatory operations; and 

consulting and professional
 fees associated with research and development activities 

We
expense research and development costs to operations as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical
trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations
or information provided to us by our vendors. 

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. We have utilized a combination of internal and external efforts to advance
product development from early-stage work to clinical trial manufacturing and clinical trial support. External efforts have included
work with consultants and substantial work at CROs and CMOs. We have historically supported an internal research and development team
and facility for our pipeline and other potential development programs, however following the closing of the MannKind Transaction in
the third quarter of 2024, in which the majority of our research and development employees were terminated and our facility lease was
assigned to MannKind, we expect to utilize external resources for further development. 

22 

To
continue development of existing programs or opportunities identified for iSPERSE in any new indications, we
will need to secure additional funding and anticipate additional development costs would be incurred. Because of the numerous risks and
uncertainties associated with product development, however, we cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of these
or other current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials. The duration, costs and timing of our future clinical trials and
development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including the selected development path and uncertainties
associated with clinical and preclinical studies, clinical trial enrollment rates and changing government regulation. In addition, the
probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and
commercial viability. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries, benefits and related costs such as stock-based compensation for personnel
and consultants in executive, finance, business development, corporate communications and human resource functions, facility costs not
otherwise included in research and development expenses, patent filing fees and legal fees. Other general and administrative expenses
include travel expenses, expenses related to being a publicly traded company and professional fees for consulting, auditing and tax services. 

Following
the closing of the MannKind Transaction in the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will
decrease in the future as they relate to audit, legal, regulatory, and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with
exchange listing and SEC requirements, director and officer liability insurance, investor relations costs and other costs associated
with being a public company. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

This
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on
historical experience, known trends and events, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we
evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

There
were no changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to those described in
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report. It is important
that the discussion of our operating results that follow be read in conjunction with the critical accounting estimates disclosed in our
Annual Report.

Revenues
 Revenues were 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.8 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.4 million. The decrease is primarily related to the wind down of the PUR1900 Phase 2b clinical
trial, for which we incurred fewer expenses eligible for reimbursement under the Cipla Agreement as compared to the corresponding
period in the previous year. 

Research
and development expenses Research and development expenses were 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30,
2024, as compared to 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 3.2 million. The decrease
was primarily due to 1.7 million less employment and other operating cost following the MannKind Transaction, 1.2 million less cost
incurred on the PUR1900 program, for which the winding down of the Phase 2b clinical trial was completed during the three months ended
September 30, 2024, and 0.3 million less cost incurred on the PUR3100 program. 

General
and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses were 2.2 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 0.5 million. The increase
was primarily due to 0.6 million of increased employment costs associated with employee terminations, partially offset by 0.1 million
of decreased operating costs.

Revenues
 Revenues were 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.7 million. The increase is primarily related to a contract modification of the Cipla Agreement
which resulted in a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The amount of the cumulative
catch-up had been included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period. This increase was partially offset by the Company incurring
fewer expenses eligible for reimbursement under the Cipla Agreement as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. 

Research
and development expenses Research and development expenses were 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, as compared to 12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately 4.8 million. The decrease
was primarily due to 2.0 million less cost incurred on the PUR1900 program during the winding down of the Phase 2b clinical trial, 2.0
million less employment and other operating cost following the MannKind Transaction and 0.8 million less cost related to the PUR3100
and PUR1800 programs. 

General
and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses were 5.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 0.2 million. The increase
was primarily due to 0.4 million of increased employment costs associated with employee terminations, partially offset by 0.2 million
of decreased other operating costs. 

Loss
on MannKind Transaction Loss on MannKind Transaction was 2.6 million on certain assets held for sale as of June 30,
2024 and disposed of during the three months ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the MannKind Transaction, as compared with
no such loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Through
September 30, 2024, we incurred an accumulated deficit of 295.2 million, primarily as a result of expenses incurred through a combination
of research and development activities related to our various product candidates and general and administrative expenses supporting those
activities. We have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of preferred and common stock, the issuance of
convertible promissory notes, term loans, and collaboration and license agreements. Our total cash and cash equivalents balance as of
September 30, 2024 was 10.8 million. 

We
anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future due to development costs associated with our iSPERSE 
 pipeline programs, contingent on obtaining financing or partnership to continue such development. We may raise capital through
a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding and other collaborations and strategic alliances. We are
currently exploring financing or partnership arrangements to develop and initiate a potential Phase 2 clinical study for PUR3100. 

25 

We
expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September
30 , 2024 will enable us to fund our corporate operating expenses for at least the next 12 months
following the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions
that may prove to be incorrect, and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous
risks and uncertainties associated with research, development, achievement of contingent milestones and commercialization of pharmaceutical
products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. 

We
have no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

The
following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below (in thousands):

Net
cash used in operating activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.5 million, which was primarily the result of 7.6
million of net loss and 5.4 million in cash outflows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by
 3.6 million of net non-cash adjustments. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 14.0 million, which was primarily the result of a
net loss of 12.0 million and 4.0 million in cash outflows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset
by 2.0 million of net non-cash adjustments. 

Net
cash used in investing activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0.4 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which was due to purchases
of property and equipment. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities 

No
cash was provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted from proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs. 

Financings 

In
May 2021, we entered into the Sales Agreement with HCW to act as our sales agent with respect to the issuance and sale of up to 20,000,000
of our shares of common stock, from time to time in an ATM Offering. Upon filing of the Annual Report, we continued to be subject to
General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, pursuant to which in no event will we sell our common stock in a registered primary offering using
Form S-3 with a value exceeding more than one-third of our public float in any 12 calendar month period so long as our public float remains
below 75,000,000. Therefore, the amount we may be able to raise using the ATM Offering will be significantly less than 20,000,000,
until such time as our public float held by non-affiliates exceeds 75,000,000. 

26 

Sales
of common stock under the Sales Agreement are made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was filed
with the SEC on May 17, 2024, and subsequently declared effective on May 30, 2024 (File No. 333-279491), and a related prospectus. HCW
acts as our sales agent on a commercially reasonable efforts basis, consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable
state and federal laws, rules and regulations and the rules of Nasdaq. If expressly authorized by us, HCW may also sell our common stock
in privately negotiated transactions. There is no specific date on which the ATM Offering will end, there are no minimum sale requirements
and there are no arrangements to place any of the proceeds of the ATM Offering in an escrow, trust or similar account. HCW is entitled
to compensation at a fixed commission rate of 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no shares of our common stock were sold under the Sales Agreement. 

Known
Trends, Events and Uncertainties 

In
May 2023, the World Health Organization determined that COVID-19 no longer fit the definition of a public health emergency and the U.S.
government announced its plan to let the declaration of a public health emergency associated with COVID-19 expire on May 11, 2023. In
addition, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, including between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, and related sanctions and
countermeasures, are difficult to predict, and could adversely impact geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, the global economy,
and contribute to increased market volatility, which may in turn adversely affect our business and operations. We may not be able to
raise sufficient additional capital and may tailor our drug candidate development program based on the amount of funding we are able
to raise in the future. Nevertheless, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful. 

Other
than as discussed above and elsewhere in this report, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have
a material effect on our financial condition. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ))
as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management
necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

27 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

From
time to time, we may be involved in litigation that arises through the normal course of business. As of the date of this filing, we are
not aware of any material legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or to which any of our property is subject,
nor are we aware of any such threatened or pending litigation or any such proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities. 

We
are not aware of any material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers, or affiliates or any registered or beneficial stockholder
of more than 5 of our common stock, or any associate of any of the foregoing, is a party adverse to or has a material interest adverse
to, us or any of our subsidiaries. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Investing
in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item
1A under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, in addition to
the other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.
If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or operating results would likely suffer, possibly materially,
the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.
