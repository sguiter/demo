 million as of January 1, 2023, as a result of recognizing its Bitcoin held as of January 1, 2023, at fair value. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 is intended to enhance reportable segment disclosures by requiring disclosures of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), requiring disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and explanation of how the reported measures of segment profit and loss are used by the CODM in assessing segment performance and allocation of resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2023. The Company is finalizing its evaluation of the impact the updated guidance will have on its disclosures. of the equity interests of Block Mining, Inc. Block Mining ), a Kentucky-based, vertically-integrated Bitcoin mining company, for total consideration of approximately million, which was comprised of million in cash (adjusted for net working capital acquired and other items, excluding the payoff of debt of million, which was accounted for as a transaction separate from the acquisition) from the Company s existing cash, million shares of Riot common stock valued at approximately million, and a contingent purchase price payable to the sellers with an estimated fair value of million. Under the contingent purchase price payable, the sellers are eligible to earn an additional million in potential earn-out targets if certain milestones are reached by December 31, 2025. The acquisition of Block Mining immediately increased Riot s hash rate, expanded Riot s footprint geographically, and provided exposure to additional energy markets outside of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ERCOT , including the Paducah Power Systems, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Big Rivers Electric Corporation in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator MISO region . Block Mining is a vertically-integrated Bitcoin miner consisting of operational sites, both in Kentucky, which consist of existing operational Bitcoin mining capacity, with the potential to expand. Additionally, Block Mining owns a separate greenfield expansion opportunity in Kentucky, adjacent to an existing substation, presenting the opportunity for further expansion. Block Mining is a capital efficient developer and operator of Bitcoin mining facilities with an experienced management team that will add to Riot s ability to execute on its vertically-integrated strategy. The acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has completed a preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on provisional estimates and is subject to continuing management analysis, with assistance from third party valuation advisors. The Company expects to finalize the valuation of these assets and liabilities, and consideration transferred, as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any changes to the preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill.

 Accounts receivable Prepaid expenses and other current assets Property and equipment Right of use asset Accounts payable ) Accrued expenses ) Operating lease liability ) Debt ) Total identifiable assets and liabilities acquired Goodwill Total purchase consideration The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses were determined to be the carrying values due to the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. The fair value of the acquired trade receivables was determined to be the net realizable amount of the closing date book value of million. The fair value of property and equipment was estimated by applying the cost approach, which uses the replacement cost as an indicator of fair value. The assumptions of the cost approach include replacement cost new and physical deterioration factors including remaining life and effective age. The replacement cost new was based on a price per terahash consistent with prices the Company pays for new Bitcoin miners and an effective age of three years, consistent with the Company s current estimated useful life of Bitcoin miners. The right of use asset and operating lease liabilities consisted of an operating lease of a data center in Calvert City, Kentucky. The lease has annual payments of approximately million and a remaining lease term of approximately years as of acquisition. The assumed debt consisted of a million secured loan and a million note payable. The secured loan was paid off on the date of acquisition. The note payable carries a fixed rate of , and matures in December 2035, with annual principal and accrued interest payments beginning on December 31, 2024. The fair value of the debt at acquisition of million was determined to equal its carrying value due at acquisition as the interest rate is reasonably consistent with rates the Company would expect to incur for similar debt instruments. Goodwill was attributable to the assembled workforce of experienced personnel at Block Mining and synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations of Riot and Block Mining. The goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Bitcoin Mining reportable segment. The operating results of Block Mining have been included in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations since the acquisition date. Through September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of acquisition-related costs related to this acquisition that were expensed as incurred. The following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for Riot and Block Mining, Inc. as if the companies were combined as of January 1, 2023. The unaudited pro forma information does not reflect the effect of costs or synergies that may result from the acquisition and excludes acquisition-related costs of million incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 million common shares of Bitfarms Ltd. Bitfarms on the open market for approximately million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s investment in Bitfarms was equal to approximately of all outstanding Bitfarms common stock. In September 2024, the Company and Bitfarms entered into a settlement agreement, under which, the Company intends to review its investment in Bitfarms on a continuing basis and, subject to the terms of the settlement agreement, depending upon various factors, including without limitation, any discussion between the Company, Bitfarms and/or the Board of Bitfarms and Bitfarms advisors regarding, among other things, Bitfarms financial position and strategic direction, overall market conditions, other investment opportunities available to the Company, and the availability of securities of Bitfarms at prices that would make the purchase or sale of such securities desirable, the Company may (i) increase or decrease its position in Bitfarms through, among other things, the purchase or sale of securities of Bitfarms, including through transactions involving its common shares and/or other equity, debt, notes, other securities, or derivative or other instruments that are based upon or relate to the value of securities of Bitfarms in the open market or otherwise, (ii) enter into transactions that increase or hedge its economic exposure to its investment without affecting its beneficial ownership of Bitfarms common stock or (iii) consider or propose other actions, including submitting a revised proposal to acquire Bitfarms. On September 23, 2024, Bitfarms appointed an independent director to its Board of Directors that the Company proposed to be nominated and supported. As a result, for accounting purposes, the Company determined it obtained the ability to exercise significant influence over its investment. Therefore, the Company began accounting for its investment under the equity method of accounting and elected to account for it at fair value. There have been no intra-entity transactions, and therefore, no intra-entity profits or losses. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value measurement of the Company s investment in Bitfarms is based on quoted prices in an active market and valued at the closing price reported at the end of each period and thus represents a Level 1 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents information about the equity method investment - marketable securities marketable securities): Unrealized losses ) Fair value as of September 30, 2024 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, unrealized losses on the marketable securities were million. Convertible note During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company invested in a million convertible note at face value. The convertible note has a term and earns interest at a rate of per annum, which may be paid in cash or in-kind, and converts into equity of the issuer of the convertible note at the end of the term. The fair value measurement of the convertible note is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of the convertible note as of September 30, 2024, primarily consisted of a discount rate of , which reflected the issuance date spread premium over the selected yield for the remaining time to maturity.

 to . In making this determination, the Company took into consideration its first-hand experience of miners remaining in service beyond a two-year period, as well as its increased use of immersion-based mining, which the Company anticipates will extend the useful life of miners, due to improved heat removal and reduced exposure to particulates, as compared to traditional air-cooled mining.

 million and million, respectively, and approximately million and million, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These amounts are recorded in Power curtailment credits on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company determined the PPA meets the definition of a derivative because it allows for net settlement. However, because the Company has the ability to offer the power back for sale outside of the PPA, rather than taking physical delivery, the Company determined that physical delivery is not probable through the entirety of the contract and therefore, the Company does not believe the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception applies to the PPA. Accordingly, the PPA (a non-hedging derivative contract) is accounted for as a derivative and recorded at its estimated fair value each reporting period in Derivative asset on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with the change in the fair value recorded in Change in fair value of derivative asset on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The PPA is not designated as a hedging instrument. The Facilities Agreement, Demand Response Service Programs, and the 4CP program are not part of the PPA, and are therefore not subject to treatment and valuation as a derivative along with PPA. The estimated fair value of the Company s derivate asset is classified under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation, which include the fixed price of each block for all MW of power to be delivered per the PPA, discounted cash flow estimation models containing quoted commodity exchange spot and forward prices in megawatt hours mWh and are adjusted for basis spreads for load zone-to-hub differentials through the term of the PPA, which is scheduled to end as of April 30, 2030, and a discount rate of . Actual power usage is not a variable input in the determination of the fair value as the price and quantity of power to be delivered per the PPA are fixed despite the existence of multiple blocks with separate power amounts. The discount rate reflects the nature of the contract as it relates to the risk and uncertainty of the estimated future mark-to-market adjustments, forward price curves of the power supply, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data obtained from quoted market prices or independent pricing vendors, risk-free rate of return, which is determined from United States Treasury Bond yields, estimated cost of debt, which includes a Moody s rating, and an equity risk premium based upon market data provided by a global cost of capital service provider. The discount rate includes observable market inputs, but also includes unobservable inputs based on qualitative judgment related to Company credit risk. The following table presents the unobservable inputs used in the valuation of the Derivative asset : - December 31, 2023 Forward prices (per mWh) - The terms of the PPA require margin-based collateral, calculated as exposure resulting from fluctuations in the market cost rate of electricity versus the fixed price stated in the contract. As of September 30, 2024, the margin-based collateral requirement of the Company was . While the Company manages operating costs at the Rockdale Facility in part by periodically selling back unused or uneconomical power, the Company does not consider such actions to be trading activities.

Power costs incurred under the Facilities Agreement are determined every 15 minutes using settlement information provided by ERCOT and are recorded in Cost of revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the construction of the interconnection was completed and power costs under the Facilities Agreement are no longer being incurred. ERCOT has implemented Demand Response Services Programs for customers like the Company that have the ability to reduce or modify electricity use in response to ERCOT instructions or signals. These Demand Response Services Programs provide the ERCOT market with valuable grid stability and economic services by helping to preserve system reliability, enhancing competition and load predictability, mitigating price spikes, and stabilizing the grid by encouraging the demand side of the market to give more visibility and control of their power consumption to grid operators. Market participants with flexible electrical loads, like the Company, may participate in these Demand Response Service Programs directly by offering their electrical loads into the ERCOT markets, or indirectly by voluntarily reducing their energy usage in response to increasing power demand in the ERCOT marketplace. The Demand Response Services Programs run concurrent with the PPA. Under these Demand Response Services Programs, the Company can participate in a variety of programs known as ancillary services by electing to designate a portion of its available electrical load for participation in such programs on a forward basis. For each respective Demand Response Services Program, the Company receives compensation based on hourly rates for power and the amount of electrical load which it has bid into the program. Through ancillary services, the Company competitively bids amongst other market participants to sell ERCOT the ability to control the Company s electrical load on demand, which requires the Company to remain powered on during the times in which its power is bid into ancillary services, and giving ERCOT the ability to direct the Company to power down the amount of power bid into the program. The Company receives compensation for its participation in ancillary services whether or not the Company is actually called to power down. The Company also participates in the 4CP program, which refers to the highest-load settlement intervals in each of the four summer months (June, July, August, and September), during which time, demand for power is typically at its highest across the ERCOT grid. The 4CP program participants may voluntarily power down operations during these times and in doing so, reduce the electrical load demand on the ERCOT grid. Participants that reduce their load in these peak periods receive credits to transmission costs on future power bills during the subsequent year, reducing overall power costs for the year. As a result of participation in the 4CP program in 2023, the Company s transmission charges in its ongoing 2024 monthly power bills are substantially reduced. The 4CP program has an indefinite life.

Kentucky Facility In April 2021, the Company s subsidiary, Block Mining, entered into a long-term power purchase agreement (the Kentucky PPA to provide power to one of its locations in Kentucky. Pursuant to the Kentucky PPA, the Company has the ability, but not the obligation, to acquire up to a total of MW of power at one of its facilities through mid-April 2041. The all-in power rate includes a portion of the total fee that is at a fixed rate and another portion that adjusts annually. The Company determined the Kentucky PPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because it does not contain any net settlement provisions. Under the Kentucky PPA, the Company may also elect not to utilize its long-term, fixed-price power for its operations, and instead elect to sell that power back into the MISO grid in exchange for credits against future power costs when there is a benefit to the Company, depending on the spot market price of electricity. The Company s power strategy combines participation in Demand Response Services Programs and sales of power, to attempt to manage operating costs most efficiently.

Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company, and our subsidiaries, are subject at times to various claims, lawsuits and governmental proceedings relating to our business and transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the final outcome of such proceedings. Where appropriate, we vigorously defend such claims, lawsuits and proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and proceedings seek damages, including, direct, consequential, exemplary, and/or punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. Certain of the claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in ordinary course of business are covered by our insurance program. We maintain property, and various types of liability insurance in an effort to protect ourselves from such claims. In terms of any matters where there is no insurance coverage available to us, or where coverage is available and we maintain a retention or deductible associated with such insurance, we may establish an accrual for such loss, retention or deductible based on current available information. In accordance with accounting guidance, if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable, then an accrual for the cost to resolve or settle these claims is recorded by us on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. If it is reasonably possible that an asset may be impaired as of the date of the financial statement, then we disclose the range of possible loss. Costs related to the defense of such claims are recorded by us as they are incurred. Management, with the assistance of outside counsel, may from time to time adjust such accruals according to new developments in the matter, court rulings, or changes in the strategy affecting our defense of such matters. On the basis of current information, we do not believe there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss, if any, will result from any claims, lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to either individually, or in the aggregate.

The Company placed approximately million in escrow pending the final determination of the independent accountant, and, on June 9, 2023, the independent accountant rendered a written final determination finding in favor of the Company on disputed issues totaling approximately million. Accordingly, approximately million of the escrowed amount was released from escrow and distributed to the Company on June 13, 2023, with the remaining approximately million held in escrow allocated to Northern

 million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Following the final determination, Northern Data filed a complaint against the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Chancery Court on June 23, 2023 (Case No. C.A. No. 2023-0650-LWW) challenging the independent accountant s written final determination and seeking to re-litigate the purchase price adjustment process. The Company contests the legal and factual basis of Northern Data s claims and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on July 17, 2023, which the Chancery Court heard on February 13, 2024. The Chancery Court denied the motion to dismiss on May 17, 2024, at which time the court advised the parties that summary judgment briefing after focused discovery may be a worthwhile endeavor. Under the parties current schedule, discovery is ongoing and motions for summary judgment may be filed later this year. While the Company intends to vigorously oppose such complaint, the Company cannot accurately predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation, estimate the magnitude of such outcome , or forecast when such litigation will be resolved , due to its early stage. Legacy Hosting Customer Disputes Rhodium On May 2, 2023, Whinstone US, Inc. Whinstone filed a petition against Rhodium 30MW, LLC Rhodium 30MW ), Rhodium JV, LLC Rhodium JV ), Air HPC LLC Air HPC ), and Jordan HPC, LLC Jordan HPC and, together with Rhodium 30MW, Rhodium JV, and Air HPC, collectively, the Defendants in Case No. CV41873 in the 20th District Court (the District Court of Milam County, Texas. In its amended petition filed May 3, 2023, Whinstone asserted breach of contract claims for Rhodium JV and Air HPC s failure to pay certain hosting and service fees under the now-terminated Whinstone-Rhodium hosting agreements Hosting Agreements and sought a declaration regarding the rights and obligations under certain hosting agreements with the Defendants and that no power credits are owed to any Rhodium entity under any agreement. Whinstone sought recovery of more than million, plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs, expenses, and pre- and post-judgment interest. On June 12, 2023, Defendants answered and, along with non-parties Rhodium Encore LLC, Rhodium 2.0 LLC, and Rhodium 10mw LLC (collectively, the Rhodium Non-Parties and, together with Defendants, collectively, Rhodium ), filed contingent counterclaims for breach of contract and moved to compel arbitration for alleged unpaid energy sale credits and lost profits. On August 14, 2023, Whinstone filed a second amended petition to include a declaration regarding the rights and obligations under the now-terminated water agreement between Whinstone and various Rhodium entities. On September 13, 2023, the District Court compelled Whinstone s claims against Defendants to arbitration over Whinstone s objection and stayed the lawsuit pending such arbitration. On December 11, 2023, Rhodium submitted an arbitration demand to the American Arbitration Association AAA ), seeking damages and specific performance of unspecified contracts. Rhodium amended its demand on June 4, 2024 to include additional claims and disclosed it seeks at least million in damages. Whinstone does not believe Rhodium s claims have any merit, and will vigorously contest such claims, as appropriate. Whinstone objected to the AAA s jurisdiction and authority to entertain the claims and decide any issues of arbitrability. Subject to those objections, Whinstone submitted counterclaims to the AAA on December 29, 2023 against Rhodium JV and Air HPC for breach of contract, seeking recovery of at least million in past-due revenue share payments, plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs, expenses, and pre- and post-judgment interest. After a permanent arbitrator was appointed and written discovery commenced, Rhodium filed for bankruptcy protection on August 24, 2024 and August 29, 2024 in a now jointly administered proceeding styled In re: Rhodium Encore LLC, et al. , Case No. 24-90448 (ARP), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas Houston Division. Therein, Rhodium filed a motion to assume the Hosting Agreements, and the court set a contested hearing on the matter commencing November 12, 2024. Because depositions have not been completed, the Company cannot reasonably predict the outcome of such ongoing proceedings, or the magnitude of such an outcome, at this time. SBI Crypto Co. On April 5, 2023, SBI Crypto Co., Ltd. SBI filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (Case No. 6:23-cv-252), which it later amended, against Whinstone alleging breach of contract, fraud, and negligent bailment claims related to a colocation services agreement between Whinstone and SBI that was terminated in 2021. On July 21, 2023, Whinstone

 million in lost profits and at least million for equipment damage, plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs, expenses, costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest. Whinstone believes many of the claims are barred or waived, and that all of SBI s claims substantively lack merit, and Whinstone plans to vigorously contest the same, as appropriate. While a preliminary investigation of the merits of SBI s claims has commenced and because this litigation is still at this early stage, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome of such ongoing litigation, or the magnitude of such an outcome, at this time. GMO On June 13, 2022, GMO Gamecenter USA, Inc. and its parent, GMO Internet Group, Inc. (collectively GMO ), filed a complaint against Whinstone alleging breach of a colocation services agreement between GMO and Whinstone, which has since been terminated, seeking damages in excess of million for lost profit and profit-sharing payments GMO alleges it was owed from Whinstone. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 1:22-cv-05974-JPC). Whinstone has responded to GMO s claims and raised counterclaims of its own, alleging GMO itself breached the colocation services agreement, seeking a declaratory judgment and damages in excess of million. On October 19, 2023, GMO filed its fourth amended complaint claiming an additional million in damages, for loss of future profits and future profit-sharing payments GMO alleges would have been received through the term of the agreement, based on Whinstone s allegedly wrongful termination of the colocation services agreement as of June 29, 2023. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome of such ongoing litigation, or the magnitude of such an outcome, at this time. Unvested RSAs Unvested RSUs Total reportable segments: Bitcoin Mining and Engineering. The reportable segments are identified based on the types of service performed. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments. Gross profit (loss) is the segment performance measure the CODM uses to assess the Company s reportable segments. Segment gross profit (loss) is defined as segment revenue less segment cost of revenue, and is before elimination of intersegment profits. Prior to 2024, the Company had a Data Center Hosting reportable segment but has since terminated all contracts with its Data Center Hosting customers. Commencing with the three months ended March 31, 2024, the CODM ceased analyzing the performance of the Data Center Hosting operations and the Company ceased reporting Data Center Hosting as a separate reportable business segment. The Company has no plans to offer data center hosting services to new customers. All residual revenue and costs of revenue related to Data Center Hosting incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are included in Revenue: Other and Cost of Revenue: Other. Prior period amounts related to Data Center Hosting have been recast into Revenue: Other and Cost of Revenue: Other . Other than the million of goodwill from the Block Mining acquisition allocated to the Bitcoin Mining segment, the Company does not allocate assets to the reporting segments because its assets are managed on an entity-wide basis and, therefore, does not separately disclose the total assets of its reportable operating segments. The Bitcoin Mining segment generates revenue from the Bitcoin the Company earns through its Bitcoin mining activities. The Engineering segment generates revenue through customer contracts for custom engineered electrical products. All Revenue: Other revenue is from external customers.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (this MD A should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes (the Notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, as included in our 2023 Annual Report.

Such statements express management s beliefs, opinions, projections and expectations regarding future events and circumstances, based on information available to management as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Further, these forward-looking statements should not be construed either as assurances of performance or as promises of a given course of action. You should review the sections of this Quarterly Report entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially and potentially adversely from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this MD A and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts are stated in thousands of U.S. Dollars except for: share, per share, and miner amounts; Bitcoin quantities, prices, and hash rate; cost to mine one Bitcoin; and production value of one Bitcoin mined. Business Overview We are a vertically-integrated Bitcoin mining company principally engaged in enhancing our capabilities to mine Bitcoin in support of the Bitcoin blockchain. Our Rockdale Facility is believed to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America, as measured by developed capacity, and we are currently evaluating further growing its capacity. Additionally, we are developing the Corsicana Facility, a second large-scale Bitcoin mining facility, which, upon completion, is expected to have approximately 1.0 gigawatts GW of capacity available for our own Bitcoin Mining activities. On July 23, 2024, we completed a transaction to acquire Block Mining, a Kentucky-based vertically-integrated Bitcoin miner consisting of two operational sites, both in Kentucky, totaling 60 MW of operational capacity with potential to expand up to 155 MW. We intend to expand Block Mining s two sites, targeting 110 MW for self-mining operations by the end of 2024. Additionally, Block Mining owns a greenfield expansion opportunity, adjacent to an existing substation, presenting an opportunity to develop 60 MW and with potential to expand to 150 MW. Block Mining is a capital efficient developer and operator of Bitcoin mining facilities that will add to our ability to execute our leading vertically-integrated strategy. We operate in an environment which is constantly evolving based on the proliferation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. A significant component of our strategy is to effectively and efficiently allocate capital between opportunities that generate the highest return on investment. Industry Trends The price of Bitcoin increased during the first quarter of 2024 due to a new source of demand, the eleven Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds ETFs approved to begin trading by the SEC on January 11, 2024. Significant interest in the ETFs followed their introduction. One such ETF earned recognition as the fastest ETF ever to surpass 10 billion in assets under management since its launch. The ETFs, as an investment vehicle, provided a new access point for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through more traditional methods resulting in the ETFs seeing a combined net inflow of approximately 18.5 billion through September 30, 2024. During 2023 and 2024, the Bitcoin mining industry saw record growth as the price of Bitcoin increased from the lows experienced in early 2023. The increasing Bitcoin price renewed opportunities to access capital markets to fund growth, leading to unprecedent expansion in mining operations and resulting in a doubling in the size of provisioned hash calculation services on the network, as measured by total hash rate. Many Bitcoin mining companies heavily invested in infrastructure, upgrading and expanding mining fleets in advance of the April 2024 Bitcoin network halving. We expect competition within the mining industry to continue as long as Bitcoin prices remain elevated or increase further. The Bitcoin mining industry recently experienced an increase in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network, as well as an increase in overall demand for Bitcoin. Various protocols on the Bitcoin network gained popularity during 2023, and at various times temporarily resulted in a significant increase in the transaction fee paid to add a certain Bitcoin transaction to the blockchain. These

 transaction fees are volatile in nature but are paid directly to miners and are representative of public interest in transacting in Bitcoin. Transaction fees are packaged with the block subsidy issued by the Bitcoin network to combine for the total reward paid to miners upon solving a block. The Bitcoin subsidy issued by the Bitcoin network for solving a block is subject to periodic incremental halving. The network halving is a preprogrammed, fixed process of the Bitcoin network where the Bitcoin subsidy for solving a block received by miners is reduced by half approximately every four years. The network halving is a process designed to implement a periodic decreasing schedule of the issuance of new Bitcoin into the market which results in a predictable and controlled inflationary rate. The network halving will continue to occur on this schedule until the amount of Bitcoin in existence reaches the cap of 21.0 million. Historically, many Bitcoin miners have been a source of selling pressure on Bitcoin as miners have sold their production to fund operations. After each halving, the decrease in the subsidy provided to miners from the Bitcoin network may lead to fewer rewards for miners and thus may result in a decrease in the supply of bitcoin sold by miners into the market. The network halving occurred in April 2024, cutting the subsidy from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin per block. Prior to the halving event, shifts in strategy by prominent Bitcoin miners focused on implementing vertically-integrated business models whereby Bitcoin miners own and operate their own facilities rather than renting out space from a third-party s data center. Vertical integration provides additional control over operational outcomes as well as better management of any input costs such as power and overhead fees. Flexibility, and the ability to manage expenses, becomes increasingly important as the amount of competition on the Bitcoin network expands and the subsidy in Bitcoin provided by the network contracts decreases. Network difficulty, which is a measure of how hard it is for miners to solve a block on the Bitcoin blockchain (and, thus, earn a mining reward), is determined by the network s total hash rate i.e. , the total computational power devoted to solving a block), which is adjusted every 2,016 blocks (with a new block being added approximately every ten minutes). Therefore, as more miners join the network and the network s global hash rate increases, its difficulty will increase. Conversely, if miners leave the network and its hash rate decreases, its difficulty will decrease. We have observed that when the market price for Bitcoin experiences a sustained increase (as it did across 2023), new miners are introduced onto the Bitcoin network, increasing its network hash rate, and network difficulty has increased as a result. Thus, despite increasing our hash rate by approximately 158.7 from September 30, 2023, to September 30, 2024, the halving in April 2024 and increased network difficulty following increased network hash rate across the periods resulted in an approximately 33.7 decrease in the number of Bitcoin we mined for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Accordingly, as market prices for Bitcoin increase and more miners and hash rate are drawn onto the Bitcoin network, network difficulty will continue to increase, meaning existing miners like us will need to increase their hash rate to maintain and improve their chances of earning a Bitcoin mining reward. To do this, we continually seek out new Bitcoin mining capacity, including through our acquisition and development of new Bitcoin mining facilities (such as the Corsicana Facility and our acquisition of Block Mining) and the electricity supply and distribution facilities to service them, as well as other strategic growth opportunities. Further, we have adopted new and improved technology to increase both our mining power and efficiency, including our industrial-scale adoption of immersion cooling and our strategic acquisitions of large quantities of the newest, most powerful and most efficient miners available. The Company has led the industry by focusing on a vertically-integrated business model since 2021. We continue to focus on building long-term stockholder value by taking strategic actions to further vertically-integrate our business at the current Rockdale Facility, developing the Corsicana Facility, and having acquired the Kentucky Facility. Management believes a focus on vertical integration will positively affect each of our business segments by providing increased capacity for our Bitcoin Mining operations, more opportunities for implementing our proprietary power strategy, and by capitalizing on supply chain efficiencies garnered through our Engineering segment. We continue to focus on deploying our efficient Bitcoin mining fleet, at scale, while realizing the benefits of being an owner and operator of our Bitcoin Mining facilities. We anticipate the Bitcoin network will continue to see increased competition and that 2024 will be a period of consolidation in the Bitcoin mining industry. Further, given our relative position, liquidity, and absence of any significant long-term debt, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from such consolidation. We are continuously evaluating opportunities which we may decide to undertake as part of our strategic growth initiatives; however, we can offer no assurances that any strategic opportunities which we decide to undertake will be achieved on the schedule or within the budget we anticipate, if at all, and our business and financial results may change significantly as a result of such strategic growth.

 Bitcoin Mining We own and operate one of the largest Bitcoin Mining operations in North America. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to deploy miners at our Rockdale Facility, continued development activities and commencement of deployment of miners at the Corsicana Facility, with the objective of increasing our operational efficiency and performance in the future, and acquired the Kentucky Facility. As of September 30, 2024, our Bitcoin Mining business segment had a total deployed hash rate capacity of approximately 28.2 EH/s, as compared to 12.4 EH/s as of December 31, 2023, and 10.9 EH/s as of September 30, 2023, resulting in increases of 127.4 and 158.7 , respectively. We anticipate achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of approximately 34.9 EH/s by the end of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we mined 3,312 Bitcoin, which represented a decrease of 1,684 Bitcoin from the 4,996 Bitcoin we mined during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty, which has more than doubled since January 2023, and the halving that occurred in April 2024, partially offset by higher Bitcoin prices and our increase in deployed hash rate. As Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, it is not required that Bitcoin be held by a custodian, and we may elect to self-custody. However, we believe our private keys relating to our Bitcoin are better safeguarded by the secure environment provided by custodians. Self-custodying poses an increased risk to our private keys and we may not have the same level of protection as custody providers who are well versed in industry best practices to protect digital assets from potential theft, loss, or destruction. Pursuant to the Digital Asset Custodial Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2023, between us and NYDIG Trust Company LLC NYDIG (as may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the NYDIG Custodial Agreement ), NYDIG, a well-known U.S.-based third-party digital asset-focused custodian, holds our Bitcoin in cold storage wallets in a digital asset account in our name. In exchange for its custodial services, NYDIG charges an annual fee equal to a percentage of our custodied Bitcoin based on the daily average value in U.S. dollars of the Bitcoin we custody with NYDIG. Our Bitcoin held in such digital asset accounts does not constitute deposits within the meaning of U.S. federal or state banking law and the digital asset accounts are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. The cold storage wallets in which our Bitcoin is held are all located in the United States. The NYDIG Custodial Agreement contains certain mutual indemnification provisions, including that NYDIG will indemnify us against direct claims for loss of custodied assets that arise directly from NYDIG s or NYDIG s nominees grossly negligent action, grossly negligent failure to act, bad faith or willful misconduct. For more information on the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, see the full text of the NYDIG Custodial Agreement included hereto as Exhibit 10.2, which qualifies the forgoing descriptions of the NYDIG Custodial Agreement in its entirety. We are also a party to a Digital Asset Execution Agreement with NYDIG Execution LLC NYDIG Execution ), pursuant to which NYDIG Execution executes or arranges transactions of our Bitcoin Orders as our agent. NYDIG Execution earns a commission on each trade determined by the net trade proceeds in U.S. dollars. NYDIG Execution does not charge us additional fees for principal trades. We deliver our Orders to NYDIG Execution via a designated security procedure, and each Order is affirmatively accepted by NYDIG Execution. While our Bitcoin may temporarily be processed through a NYDIG Execution customer account, NYDIG has covenanted that our assets will not be commingled with the assets of NYDIG Execution. NYDIG Execution is required to deposit any cash from the sale of our Bitcoin into our bank account at a U.S. depositary institution, less any applicable commissions. NYDIG Execution does not guarantee the value of our Bitcoin and is not responsible for any delay or failure to complete any Order caused by a digital asset network. If NYDIG Execution fails to (1) execute a properly executable Order and (2) give us notice of such failure, NYDIG Execution will only be liable for our actual damages. Our custodian and brokerage services relationships are non-exclusive, and we may freely change our Bitcoin custodian and brokerage relationships at any time. We continually monitor our Bitcoin assets held by third-party custodians, and we have unlimited audit rights with respect to such custodial accounts. The Company performs monthly reconciliations of our Bitcoin assets held by our custodian(s) and the records of our mining pool, and our independent auditors verify the location and quantity of our Bitcoin assets annually, as part of the year-end audit process of our financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting. The Company s insurance providers do not have inspection rights associated with our Bitcoin assets held in cold storage.

The difference between deployed hash rate and operating hash rate is attributable to down time of all or some of miners for power curtailments, or repairs and maintenance of Bitcoin miners or supporting infrastructure. The difference between deployed and operating hash rate is a key measure in determining the efficiency of our Bitcoin Mining operations. As of September 30, 2024, our Bitcoin Mining segment had a total hash rate, deployed of approximately 28.2 EH/s, as compared to 10.9 EH/s as of September 30, 2023. (2) Developed power is the total amount of electricity our facilities can utilize for Bitcoin Mining. (3) All-in power cost is the price we paid throughout the period for our power, net of power curtailments received. Power is overwhelmingly the largest marginal input cost in mining Bitcoin and a significant contributor to profitability. Miners with a low cost of power will also being able to profitability mine in a wider range of Bitcoin price.

(2) Costs to finance the purchase of miners were zero in all periods presented as the miners were paid for with cash from the Company s cash balance. The seller did not provide any financing nor did the Company borrow from a third-party to purchase the miners. (3) Power curtailment credits are credited against our power invoices as a result of temporarily pausing our operations to participate in ERCOT s Demand Response Service Programs. Our fixed-price power purchase contracts enable us to strategically curtail our mining operations and participate in these programs, which significantly lower our cost to mine Bitcoin. These credits are recognized in Power curtailment credits on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, outside of cost of revenue, but significantly reduce our overall cost to mine Bitcoin.

During 2023, we entered into two purchase orders under the Master Agreement to acquire new immersion miners from MicroBT with a total hash rate of 25.6 EH/s, for a total purchase price of approximately 453.4 million, subject to downward price adjustment as provided by the Master Agreement. These new miners are primarily for use at our new Corsicana Facility, which commenced operations in April 2024. Delivery of these miners began in 2023, with all miners expected to be received by the end of 2024. The Master Agreement also provides us with four annual options to purchase additional miners, on the same or better terms as the second purchase order executed under the Master Agreement, for a total hash rate of approximately 75.0 EH/s, assuming exercise of all four annual purchase options. 

 37 

Table of Contents 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we executed an additional purchase order with MicroBT under the Master Agreement to acquire new air-cooled miners with a total hash rate of 5.9 EH/s, for a total purchase price of approximately 96.7 million. This purchase order is in addition to the four purchase options remaining under the Master Agreement. Delivery of these miners occurred in the third quarter of 2024, with deployment commencing upon delivery. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Bitcoin Mining revenue was approximately 67.5 million and 194.7 million, respectively. Data Center Hosting In 2023, we made the decision to stop pursuing new hosting contracts and end our legacy contracts, to focus on our self-mining efforts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all agreements with Data Center Hosting customers were terminated, and we have no plans to offer data center hosting services to new customers. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we no longer report Data Center Hosting as a separate reportable segment. Engineering Our Engineering business segment designs and manufacturers power distribution equipment and custom engineered electrical products that provide us with the ability to vertically-integrate many of the critical electrical components and engineering services necessary for our Corsicana Facility development and Rockdale Facility expansions and to reduce our execution and counter-party risk in ongoing and future expansion projects. Engineering and other specialized talent employed in our Engineering business segment also allows us to continue to explore new methods to optimize and develop a best-in-class Bitcoin Mining operation and has been instrumental in the development of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware. Our Engineering business segment also provides electricity distribution product design, manufacturing, and installation services primarily focused on large-scale commercial and governmental customers and serves a broad scope of clients across a wide range of markets including data center, power generation, utility, water, industrial, and alternative energy. Products are custom built to client and industry specifications. Engineering revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Engineering revenue is recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Engineering revenue was approximately 12.6 million and 26.9 million. respectively. Power Strategy Long-term power contracts form the basis of our power strategy. We utilize our 345 MW PPA in three ways: Manual Curtailment We power down operations and return power back to the utility when market prices for electricity provide the potential for us to receive more power curtailment credits than the Bitcoin Mining revenues we would have generated had we not curtailed our mining operations. We receive power credits for the difference in the market power price and our fixed power price, which provides us the ability to maximize our overall profitability between Bitcoin Mining and supporting the grid by not drawing power from the grid when electricity is most scarce.

 ERCOT Ancillary Services We competitively bid to sell ERCOT the option to control our electrical load during certain hours. ERCOT compensates us in the form of Demand Response Credits, which are received whether or not ERCOT calls on us to power down. ERCOT s 4CP Program We voluntarily power down operations during times of peak demand in summer months. Participation provides us substantial savings on transmission costs in the subsequent year s power bills, reducing our overall power costs. The following table presents our power curtailment credits: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Manual curtailment power credits 11,926 41,127 24,923 51,340 Demand response power credits 491 8,474 6,522 14,806 Total power curtailment credits 12,417 49,601 31,445 66,146 The following graph presents the primary decision points that guide our decision to curtail power usage or power down our mining operations, and when we might resume mining operations: ERCOT Grid Curtailment The Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT ), ERCOT, and Oncor Electric Delivery Company Oncor collectively oversee the regulatory, administrative, and delivery aspects of our power supply in Texas. In recent years, regulatory scrutiny on Bitcoin mining facilities and their energy consumption has intensified as the practice has become more widespread. As the grid operator, ERCOT is responsible for monitoring and testing market participants, including our Bitcoin mining data centers in Rockdale and Corsicana, to evaluate their impact on grid reliability. During this process, ERCOT may issue curtailment notices to reduce the power usage at our Texas operations. We are periodically tested and monitored, and have experienced curtailment of power based on instructions we receive from Oncor and ERCOT. Due to the uncertainties regarding the duration or extent of power curtailments and testing procedures, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate any potential impacts to our business. If we

Table of Contents 
 cannot secure adequate access to electrical power, we may be forced to reduce or shut down our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Global Logistics Global supply logistics have caused delays across all channels of distribution. We have also experienced delays in our Engineering segment s manufacturing and delivery schedule, and in our infrastructure development schedules, resulting from constraints on the globalized supply chains for miners, electricity distribution equipment and construction materials. Through the date of this Quarterly Report, we have been able to effectively and efficiently mitigate delivery delays to avoid materially impacting our miner deployment schedule; however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to mitigate any such delivery delays in the future. Additionally, the development of the Corsicana Facility requires large quantities of construction materials, specialized electricity distribution equipment, and other component parts that are in high demand and can be difficult to source. To help mitigate the impacts of global supply chain constraints and increasing demand for these goods, including any inflationary pricing concerns that may result, we procured all the required components and materials for development of the first 400 MW phase of the Corsicana Facility, and we have procured and already hold many of the components and materials required for development of the next 600 MW phase of our development of the Corsicana Facility, as well as replacement components and parts for our existing systems, to help shorten the impact of potential damage to installed equipment. We continue to monitor developments in the global supply chain and assess their potential impact on our expansion plans. Summary of Riot s Bitcoin Mining Results The following tables present additional information about our own Bitcoin Mining activities, including Bitcoin production and sales of the Bitcoin mined: 

Quantity Amounts Balance as of January 1, 2024 7,362 311,178 Revenue recognized from Bitcoin mined 3,312 194,651 Change in Bitcoin receivable 6 (93) Proceeds from sale of Bitcoin (212) (9,518) Exchange of Bitcoin for employee compensation (41) (2,099) Change in fair value of Bitcoin 166,231 Balance as of September 30, 2024 10,427 660,350

Total revenue consists of our Bitcoin Mining revenue, Engineering revenue, and Other revenue. Other revenue consists almost entirely of residual activity related to our ceased Data Center Hosting segment. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Bitcoin Mining revenue was 67.5 million and 31.2 million, respectively. The increase of 36.3 million was primarily due to higher Bitcoin prices in the 2024 period, which averaged 61,133 per coin, as compared to 28,228 per coin for the 2023 period. Despite the substantial increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty and the April 2024 halving, Bitcoin production was consistent for each of the periods presented.

Table of Contents 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Engineering revenue was 12.6 million and 15.5 million, respectively. The decrease of 2.9 million was primarily attributable to supply chain constraints resulting in decreased receipts of materials, delaying the completion of certain custom products, and, therefore, the recognition of revenue. Our custom electrical products such as switchgear and power distribution centers are used as important components in data center development and in power generation and distribution facilities, and there has been increased demand for these products due to the continued increase in data center construction by developers, as well as the continually increasing worldwide demand for power. Costs and expenses For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Cost of revenue for Bitcoin Mining consisted of the following: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Power 41,864 22,460 Compensation 3,786 Insurance on miners 1,871 803 Ground rent and related water and property tax 1,565 Other (1) 2,386 1,186 Total Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue 51,472 24,449 (1) All amounts included within Other are individually insignificant. The increase of approximately 27.0 million of Cost of revenue for Bitcoin Mining was primarily due to the increase in Bitcoin mining capacity at the Rockdale Facility and commencement of Bitcoin mining activities at the Corsicana Facility, both of which require additional headcount and direct costs necessary to maintain and support our expanded Bitcoin mining operations, as well as the absorption of other costs previously included in our former Data Center Hosting segment. Cost of revenue for Bitcoin Mining excludes depreciation and amortization, which are stated separately on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cost of revenue for Engineering for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 13.5 million and 13.2 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 0.3 million. The costs consisted primarily of direct materials and labor, as well as indirect manufacturing costs, all of which increased slightly as supply chain constraints began to ease during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 66.9 million and 29.1 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 37.8 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of stock-based compensation, legal and professional fees, and other personnel and related costs. The increase was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expenses of 17.0 million, which was primarily due to new grants under our long-term incentive program that was implemented in July 2023, compensation expenses of 7.6 million as a result of hiring additional employees to support our ongoing growth, increased legal and professional fees of 6.8 million primarily related to ongoing litigation and public company compliance, and 5.3 million for additional insurance and other costs primarily attributable to ongoing growth. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 60.0 million and 64.6 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately 4.6 million. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the estimated lives of our Bitcoin miners from 2 years to 3 years, partially offset by increased depreciation from the Corsicana Facility coming online in April 2024 and additional miners being deployed. The change in fair value of Bitcoin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were gains of 8.6 million and losses of 25.3 million, respectively, and were recognized to adjust the fair value of our Bitcoin held at the end of each period. The change in fair value of our derivative asset for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were losses of 24.3 million and gains of 3.9 million, respectively, and was recorded to adjust the fair value of our PPA, which was classified as a derivative asset and measured at fair value. The changes in fair value were due to changes in future power prices over the applicable period. The loss incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the average of the forward prices utilized in the discounted cash flow estimation models decreasing from 51.13 per mWh as of June 30, 2024 to 48.80 per mWh as of September 30, 2024. The gain recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable 

 41 

Table of Contents 
 to the average of the forward prices increasing from 44.12 per mWh as of June 30, 2023 to 45.55 per mWh as of September 30, 2023. Power curtailment credits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 12.4 million and 49.6 million, respectively, and represent sales of unused power under our PPA and participation in ancillary services under ERCOT Demand Response Services Programs. The amount of these credits varies from period to period depending on various factors impacting the supply of power to, and the demand for power on, the ERCOT grid, such as weather and global fuel costs. Other income (expense) For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total other income (expense) was 32.8) million and 2.3 million, respectively. The change was primarily attributable to unrealized losses on marketable securities of 38.1 million, partially offset by higher interest income earned as a result of higher cash balances and increased interest rates. Comparative Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Revenue Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 234.1 million and 201.9 million, respectively. Total revenue consists of our Bitcoin Mining revenue, Engineering revenue, and Other revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Bitcoin Mining revenue was 194.7 million, and 129.0 million, respectively. The increase of 65.7 million was primarily due to higher Bitcoin prices in the 2024 period, which averaged 58,771 per coin, as compared to 25,818 per coin for the 2023 period, which was partially offset by a decrease of 1,684 Bitcoin mined in the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to the substantial increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty and April 2024 halving. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Engineering revenue was 26.9 million and 51.0 million, respectively. The decrease of 24.1 million was primarily attributable to supply chain constraints resulting in decreased receipts of materials, delaying the completion of certain custom products, and, therefore, the recognition of revenue. Our custom electrical products such as switchgear and power distribution centers are used as important components in data center development and in power generation and distribution facilities, and there has been increased demand for these products due to the continued increase in data center construction by developers, as well as the continually increasing worldwide demand for power. Costs and expenses For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Cost of revenue for Bitcoin Mining consisted of the following: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Power 96,326 65,513 Compensation 9,251 Insurance on miners 5,246 2,911 Ground rent and related water and property tax 4,171 Other (1) 8,302 1,571 Total Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue 123,296 69,995 (1) All amounts included within Other are individually not material. The increase of approximately 53.3 million was primarily due to the increase in Bitcoin mining capacity at the Rockdale Facility, and commencement of Bitcoin mining activities at the Corsicana Facility, both of which require more headcount and direct costs necessary to maintain and support our expanded Bitcoin mining operations, as well as the absorption of other costs previously included in our Data Center Hosting segment. Cost of revenue for Bitcoin Mining excludes depreciation and amortization, which are stated separately on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Cost of revenue for Engineering for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 27.8 million and 46.9 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately 19.1 million. The costs consisted primarily of direct materials and labor, as well as indirect manufacturing costs. Consistent with the causes of decreased Engineering revenue noted above, the decrease was primarily due to decreased receipts of materials resulting from increased competition for direct materials due to supply chain constraints. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 185.8 million and 61.6 million, respectively, an increase of approximately 124.2 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of stock-based compensation, legal and professional fees, and other personnel and related costs. The increase was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expenses of 80.3 million, which was primarily due to new grants under our long-term incentive program, compensation expenses of 15.8 million as a result of hiring additional employees to support our ongoing growth, increased legal and professional fees of 12.7 million primarily related to ongoing litigation and public company compliance, and 15.4 million for additional insurance and other costs primarily attributable to ongoing growth. Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 129.7 million and 190.1 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately 60.4 million. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the estimated lives of our Bitcoin miners from 2 years to 3 years, partially offset by increased depreciation from the Corsicana Facility coming online in April 2024 and additional miners being deployed. The change in fair value of Bitcoin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were gains of 166.2 million and 72.7 million, respectively, and were recognized to adjust the fair value of our Bitcoin held at the end of each period. The change in fair value of our derivative asset for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were gains of 23.4 million and 11.3 million, respectively, and was recorded to adjust the fair value of our PPA, which was classified as a derivative asset and measured at fair value. The changes in fair value were due to changes in future power prices over the applicable period. The gain incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the average of the forward prices utilized in the discounted cash flow estimation models increasing from 45.15 per mWh as of December 31, 2023 to 48.80 per mWh as of September 30, 2024. The gain recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to the average of the forward prices increasing from 43.59 per mWh as of December 31, 2022 to 45.55 per mWh as of September 30, 2023. Power curtailment credits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 31.4 million and 66.1 million, respectively, and represent sales of unused power under our PPA and participation in ancillary services under ERCOT Demand Response Services Programs. The amount of these credits varies from period to period depending on various factors impacting the supply of power to, and the demand for power on, the ERCOT grid, such as weather and global fuel costs. Casualty-related charges (recoveries), net, were 2.5) million and 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In December 2022, the Rockdale Facility was damaged during severe winter storms in Texas, resulting in casualty-related charges being recognized in 2023. The income recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was the result of cash recoveries from insurance claims related to the December 2022 winter storms. Other income (expense) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total other income (expense) was 7.6 million and 3.4 million, respectively. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest income earned as a result of higher cash balances and increased interest rates, partially offset by unrealized losses on marketable securities of 13.6 million. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to financial measures presented under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ), we consistently evaluate our use of and calculation of non-GAAP performance measures such as Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is computed as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure defined as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations, which management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of our core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items. 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important performance measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric for share-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, net income, the most comparable measure under GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted net income per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this performance measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss) , the most comparable GAAP performance measure: 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) (154,362) (80,040) (27,034) (88,914) Interest (income) expense (5,175) (2,318) (21,132) (3,331) Income tax expense (benefit) 32 (157) 65 (5,014) Depreciation and amortization 60,000 64,569 129,669 190,071 EBITDA (99,505) (17,946) 81,568 92,812 Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 30,567 13,519 94,702 14,652 Acquisition-related costs 3,079 3,079 Change in fair value of derivative asset 24,318 (3,943) (23,398) (11,274) Unrealized loss (gain) on equity method investment - marketable securities 38,082 13,620 Loss (gain) on sale/exchange of equipment 5,306 68 5,336 Casualty-related charges (recoveries), net (2,487) 1,526 Other (income) expense (90) (31) (131) (96) License fees (24) (24) (48) (48) Adjusted EBITDA (3,573) (3,119) 166,973 102,908 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of September 30, 2024, we had net working capital of approximately 590.6 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of 355.7 million and marketable securities of 190.1 million. We reported a net loss of 27.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included 143.6 million in non-cash net gains, primarily consisting of revenue recognized from Bitcoin mined of 194.7 million, the change in fair value of Bitcoin of 166.2 million, and the change in fair value of the derivative asset of 23.4 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization of 129.7 million, stock-based compensation of 94.7 million, and the unrealized loss on marketable securities of 13.6 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 212 Bitcoin for proceeds of approximately 9.5 million. Subsequent to those sales, we made the strategic decision to temporarily halt the sale of all our Bitcoin production and instead, increase our Bitcoin holdings. Contractual Commitments (Miners and Related Equipment) Through September 30, 2024, we have paid approximately 448.5 million in total deposits and payments to MicroBT for the purchase of miners. The remaining commitment of approximately 112.5 million is due in installments through approximately December 2024 based on the estimated miner delivery schedule. Through September 30, 2024, we paid 72.4 million in total deposits and payments for the purchase of immersion cooling systems. The remaining commitment of approximately 7.7 million is due upon commissioning of the systems, which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Development of the Corsicana Facility In 2022, we announced our planned development of the Corsicana Facility, our second large-scale Bitcoin mining facility located on a 265-acre site in Navarro County, Texas. The Corsicana Facility is expected, upon completion, to have 1.0 GW of developed capacity for Bitcoin mining, with an additional 200 MW of electrical capacity available for development, at our discretion, which is securely supplied with power by a substation being developed for us on the premises that will be interconnected with the nearby Navarro Switch. The strategic decision to locate the Corsicana Facility next to the Navarro Switch was made to limit electricity lost in transmission and maximize the efficiency of our substation s power distribution facilities. The initial phase of the development of the Corsicana Facility involved the construction of a 400 MW substation and an equal amount of immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining infrastructure spread across multiple buildings, as well as construction of various utilities, offices, warehouses, and infrastructure to support the facility s operations. Our Bitcoin mining operations commenced in April 2024, following commissioning of the substation. As of September 30, 2024, Corsicana deployed 300 MW of Bitcoin mining infrastructure comprised of three 100 MW buildings, Buildings A1, A2 and B1, which were completed, and the fourth 100 MW building, Building B2, was under construction. Development of Building B2 continues on schedule and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024. We estimate that the total cost of the first 400 MW phase of the development will be approximately 381.4 million. Through September 30, 2024, we had incurred costs of approximately 377.6 million related to the development of the Corsicana Facility, including 10.1 million for land. We expect to incur the remaining 3.8 million during the remainder of 2024. Revenue from Operations Bitcoin Mining We expect to generate ongoing revenue from Bitcoin rewards from our Bitcoin Mining operations and our ability to liquidate Bitcoin rewards at future values will be regularly evaluated to generate cash for operations. Generating Bitcoin rewards which exceed our production and overhead costs will determine our ability to report profit margins related to such Bitcoin Mining operations, although accounting for our reported profitability is significantly complex. Furthermore, regardless of our ability to generate proceeds from the sale of our Bitcoin produced from our Bitcoin Mining business, we may elect to continue our strategy of holding the Bitcoin rewards we earn from our Bitcoin Mining operations, and we may need to raise additional capital in the form of equity or debt to fund our operations and pursue our business strategy. The ability to raise funds through the sale of equity, debt financings, or the sale of Bitcoin to maintain our operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and, even if we were successful, future equity issuances or convertible debt offerings could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, and any future debt or debt securities may contain covenants that limit our operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. Our ability to realize revenue through Bitcoin production and successfully convert Bitcoin into cash or fund overhead with Bitcoin is subject to a number of risks, including regulatory, financial and business risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, we have observed significant historical volatility in the market price of Bitcoin and, as such, future prices cannot be predicted. Engineering Substantially all Engineering revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers specifications under fixed-price contracts. Revenue is recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. The length of time required to complete a custom product varies but is typically between four and 12 weeks. Customers are typically required to make periodic progress payments based on contractually agreed-upon milestones. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from our Bitcoin Mining and Engineering operations when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending or explore other strategic alternatives. Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 156.7 million and 12.0 million, respectively. The increase in cash used was primarily attributable to 109.3 million reduction in proceeds from the sale of Bitcoin due to our ceasing of sales of Bitcoin early in 2024, increased power costs of 30.7 million, and a 43.9 million increase in selling, 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 general, and administrative costs, excluding stock-based compensation, both of which were primarily driven by our increased mining capacity and headcount, combined with other general operating costs such as insurance and information technology projects to support our growth. Investing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 726.2 million and 232.4 million, respectively, which was primarily attributable to purchases and deposits paid for miners and purchases of property and equipment for our ongoing expansions, as we continue towards our anticipated 34.9 EH/s of total self-mining hash rate capacity by the end of 2024. We completed our expansion of the Rockdale Facility during the year ended December 31, 2023, and continue to develop the Corsicana Facility, which commenced self-mining operations during the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate incurring additional costs related to the first phase of the Corsicana Facility of approximately 3.8 million during the remainder of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 448.5 million in deposits and payments for the purchase of miners, and anticipate additional payments of 112.5 million to be made in 2024. During 2024, we also purchased 90.1 million shares of Bitfarms common stock for 203.8 million and acquired Block Mining for 7.2 million in cash (net of cash acquired). Financing Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 714.1 million and 304.1 million, respectively, consisting primarily of proceeds from our ATM Offerings of 746.4 million and 324.6 million, respectively. We have approximately 6.3 million in long-term debt, primarily consisting of debt acquired as part of the Block Mining acquisition, and have primarily financed our strategic growth through proceeds from our ATM Offerings and issuances of our common stock. It is reasonably likely that we will continue to finance our ongoing growth with proceeds from current and future ATM Offerings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Business combinations Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for property and equipment and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe our assumptions and estimates have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Estimates used in determining the value of property and equipment included the estimated replacement costs, which included replacement cost new, remaining life, and effective age. Estimates used in determining the value of the contingent consideration included the timing and probability of achieving milestones and a discount rate. PPA Valuation Our PPA is accounted for as a derivative, the valuation of which is based on significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation, which include discounted cash flow estimation models containing quoted commodity exchange spot and forward prices and are adjusted for basis spreads for load zone-to-hub differentials through the term of the PPA. Significant judgement and estimation is required when creating the discounted cash flow estimation models. Should our discounted cash flow estimation models change significantly, potentially material changes to the fair value of the derivative asset may result, which could have a material impact on our financial statements. See Note 9. Power Supply Agreements in the Notes for a discussion of the unobservable inputs and their impact on the valuation. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Judgment is necessary in estimating the Company s various assets useful lives. This includes evaluating the Company s own usage experience with its currently owned assets, the quality of materials used in construction-related projects, and for its miners, the rate 

 46 

Table of Contents 
 of technological advancement and market-related factors such as the price of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network hash rate, which impact the value of the miners. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, which is determined based on a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Significant judgment is used when estimating future cash flows, particularly the price of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network hash rate. If such assets are considered impaired, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Should our estimates of useful lives, undiscounted future cash flows, or asset fair values change, additional and potentially material impairments may be required, which could have a material impact on our reported financial results. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense related to share-based payment awards is recognized at the grant date of the award and is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the time of the grant. Compensation cost for performance-based, share-based payment awards is recognized over the performance period when achievement of the milestones and targets becomes probable. The Company uses significant judgment in determining the likelihood of meeting milestones and market conditions. Inputs into valuation models such as Monte Carlo simulations include both the Company s and the Russell 3000 s historical and expected annual volatilities, and depending on the inputs selected, the Company could calculate significantly different estimated grant date fair values, materially impacting the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements , to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of applicable recent accounting pronouncements and any material impact on our financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. The following discussion about our market risk exposure involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. For more information regarding the forward-looking statements used in this section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, see the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements at the forepart of this Quarterly Report. Risk Regarding the Price of Bitcoin Our business and development strategies are focused on maintaining and expanding our Bitcoin Mining operations to maximize the amount of new Bitcoin rewards we earn. As of September 30, 2024, we held 10,427 Bitcoin that was recognized at its fair value of 660.4 million. All our Bitcoin held were produced from our Bitcoin Mining operations. We cannot accurately predict the future market price of Bitcoin, the future value of which will affect revenue from our operations, and any future declines in the fair value of the Bitcoin we mine and hold for our account would be reported in our financial statements and results of operations as a charge against net income, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price for our securities. As of, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10 increase in both the value of Bitcoin produced and the period end fair value of Bitcoin would have increased the fair value of our Bitcoin held and our net income by approximately 49.4 million, and a 10 decrease in both the value of Bitcoin produced and the period end fair value of Bitcoin would have decreased the fair value of our Bitcoin held and our net income by approximately 49.4 million. Risk Regarding the Price of Power As of, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 10 increase in the future power prices used to derive the fair value of our PPA derivative asset would have increased the fair value of our derivative asset and our net income by approximately 42.4

 million, and a 10 decrease would have decreased the fair value of our derivative asset and our net income by approximately 42.4 million. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) , to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we acquired 100 of the equity interests of Block Mining. The Company has not yet completed an assessment of the design and/or operating effectiveness of Block Mining s internal control over financial reporting. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are incorporating our controls and procedures into this recently acquired business. Other than those changes made in connection with the acquisition of Block Mining, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are currently in the process of integrating the Block Mining operations, control processes, and information systems into our systems and control environment and expect to include them in scope of design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ending December 31, 2025. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Disclosure under this Item is incorporated by reference to the disclosure provided in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes. Item 1A. Risk Factors Investors should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and equity as set forth herein and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. We may disclose changes to our risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material also may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and equity. The following risk factors are in addition to those presented in our 2023 Annual Report: Our revenue generation is subject to risks applicable to our mining pool, including risks outside of our control. We participate in a Full-Pay-Per-Share mining pool, which calculates Bitcoin payouts primarily based on the hash rate provided by us to the mining pool as a percentage of total network hash rate, along with other inputs. We currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from our mining pool participation, which accounted for 83.1 and 63.9 of our revenue for the nine months ended 

 48 

Table of Contents 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We own all of our miners and accompanying infrastructure, and the only connection between our assets and our mining pool is that the total hash rate capacity of our miners is currently allocated to our mining pool, which we are free to change at any time, in our discretion. Further, the mining pool in which we participate, like most mining pools, is decentralized and has protections in place to prevent malicious actors or technical errors from affecting the pool s ability to operate; however, these protections are not foolproof, and we may lose access to the mining pool, perhaps permanently. Because of the monitoring systems we have in place, we would become aware within minutes if our mining pool were to suffer downtime or cease to exist altogether, and we would expect to be able to resume mining without a mining pool within minutes, or redirect our hash rate to another mining pool, within an hour of the downtime event. However, self-mining has, historically, been less successful in earning Bitcoin rewards than participating in a mining pool, and our Bitcoin Mining revenue would become more volatile and may decline perhaps materially as a result of the loss or unavailability of our mining pool. If such unanticipated circumstances associated with our mining pool arise, and we are unable to quickly switch to another pool, self-mine without a pool or otherwise diversify our sources of Bitcoin mining revenue, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may suffer as a result. We rely on intellectual property rights, including third-party intellectual property rights, which exposes us to potential liability. Our business relies on open-source technology and third-party intellectual property in certain respects. As a result, we may become the subject of third-party intellectual property right infringement claims relating to our use of such third-party intellectual property. For example, as further identified under the heading Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report, Green Revolution Cooling, Inc. GRC has alleged that the immersion cooling systems we use, which were purchased from Midas Immersion Cooling, LLC, infringe on certain of GRC s patent claims. While we reasonably rely on the representations and warranties of third-party vendors, such as Midas Immersion Cooling, LLC, it is not possible for us to avoid all potential claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. If such claims are successful, we may be required to pay royalties or be ordered to cease using any technologies found to be infringing on such third-party rights altogether. Additionally, any such legal action would cause the diversion of time, energy, and resources away from our operations and toward defending against such actions, and such risks may dissuade us from pursuing further technological innovation in support of our strategic objectives . We are subject to counterparty risks, including in particular risks and uncertainties relating to our custodians. We rely on the well-known U.S. based third-party digital asset-focused custodian, NYDIG, to safeguard our Bitcoin using cold storage. NYDIG receives and holds our custodied assets, which includes both our digital assets and any cash we may choose to custody with NYDIG. Pursuant to the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, NYDIG has covenanted that it holds our digital assets in a segregated account that will at all times be identifiable in NYDIG's database as being stored for our benefit; that NYDIG has no right, interest or title in our digital assets; and that our digital assets do not constitute an asset on the balance sheet of NYDIG. To the extent NYDIG holds any cash on our behalf, NYDIG may hold our cash in one or more omnibus "for benefit of customers" accounts at one or more U.S. insured depository institutions. However, currently, the Company has no cash custodied, and has no immediate or future plans to custody, any cash with NYDIG. Under the terms of the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, NYDIG has covenanted that our digital assets will not be commingled with other digital assets held by NYDIG , except temporarily (typically for no longer than 12 hours, but in no case longer than 72 hours) as an operational matter, if required, to effect a transfer into or out of our digital asset account. In the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, NYDIG further represents and warrants that beneficial and legal ownership of all our digital assets is, and will remain, freely transferable without the payment of money or value and that NYDIG has no ownership interest in our account. While we believe that the NYDIG Custodial Agreement provides our business with reasonable protections for our business's operations and the safe storage of our digital assets, we make no assurances that storing our digital assets with NYDIG is free from risk. To the best of our knowledge, NYDIG safely stores our digital assets in segregated accounts as represented in the NYDIG Custodial Agreement; however, if NYDIG were to be in breach of the agreement, our digital assets could be compromised. Similarly, if NYDIG were to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy, there is a reasonable risk that recovery of our assets, though kept in segregated accounts, would be delayed or unrecoverable. Applicable insolvency law is not fully developed with respect to the holding of digital assets in custodial accounts. If our custodied Bitcoin were considered to be the property of our custodian s estate in the event that such custodian were to enter bankruptcy, receivership or similar insolvency proceedings, there is a risk that we could be treated as a general unsecured creditor of such custodian, inhibiting our ability to access our Bitcoin. Even if we are able to prevent our Bitcoin from being considered the property of a custodian s bankruptcy estate as part of an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that we would still be delayed or may otherwise experience difficulty in accessing our Bitcoin held by the affected custodian during the pendency of the insolvency proceedings. A delay in our ability to access our Bitcoin could result in the loss of the value related to some or all of our Bitcoin and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market price of our common stock. We also do not have a readily available backup custodian at this time, so if NYDIG were to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy we would need to self-custody our digital assets using cold storage until we

 could contract with another adequate custodian for the safe storage of our assets which may have a disruptive effect on our business. In the meantime, our mined Bitcoin would continue to aggregate in our proprietary wallet until we found a suitable cold storage custodian. Our success depends on external factors affecting the Bitcoin industry. The Bitcoin industry has historically been subject to various risks relating to Bitcoin, as an asset, which have affected, at times adversely, the market price of Bitcoin. The ownership of Bitcoin has, historically, been concentrated in a relatively small number of persons or entities that, collectively, hold a significant number of Bitcoin (referred to as whales in the Bitcoin industry). While the ownership of Bitcoin has diversified significantly in recent years, whales continue to exist whose market activity (e.g., sales of large numbers of Bitcoin) could have an adverse effect on the demand for, and market price of, Bitcoin, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Further, while larger, increasingly regulated exchanges with greater transparency and oversight have begun to proliferate, the Bitcoin economy remains nascent and largely opaque. The venues for Bitcoin transactions may experience greater operational problems and be exposed to a greater risk of facilitating unethical, fraudulent or illicit transactions (such as wash trading ), than traditional financial markets and securities exchanges. Digital asset trading platforms may also be susceptible to front-running activity, which is the process by which someone uses technology or market advantage to obtain prior knowledge of upcoming transactions allowing bad actors to take advantage of forthcoming price movement and make economic gains at the cost of those who introduced the transactions. Front-running is a frequent activity on centralized and decentralized digital asset trading platforms. Further, venues for Bitcoin transactions do not typically make complete information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices, and regulatory compliance available to the public, who are, therefore, unable to verify the impartiality of such venues in respect of the Bitcoin transactions they facilitate. As a result of such lack of regulation and transparency, as well as the risk posed by Bitcoin whales, wash trading and front-running, the public may lose confidence in Bitcoin transactions and the price integrity of the digital asset, which could adversely affect the market price of Bitcoin, perhaps materially, which would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. There is a finite supply of Bitcoin and the number of new Bitcoin rewarded per block algorithmically decreases over time, which poses a risk to our business. We earn revenue from Bitcoin Mining principally by earning Bitcoin rewards for solving blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain; however, the supply of new Bitcoin introduced to the market via Bitcoin mining is finite, permanently capped at 21,000,000 coins, with the last new Bitcoin expected to be mined in the year 2140 (approximately 116 years from now) according to experts. As of September 30, 2024, there were 19,762,573 Bitcoin in circulation. Accordingly, once the final new Bitcoin is introduced into the market, we will no longer earn revenue from Bitcoin Mining by earning Bitcoin rewards for solving a block. Instead, our Bitcoin Mining revenue will be dependent on the fees we earn from the transactions recorded on the blocks we solve. Historically, such transaction fees have been low; however, we have observed that, as the number of new Bitcoin introduced into the market is reduced in each halving, and as Bitcoin ownership and transactions in Bitcoin continue to proliferate, the fees charged for recorded transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain have increased. We cannot, however, predict whether such transaction fees will increase sufficiently to replace the value of earning new Bitcoin once the last Bitcoin in mined in the year 2140, and, therefore, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to earn sufficient revenue from Bitcoin Mining for our Bitcoin Mining business to continue as a going concern. Should any of these events come to pass, our business and results of operation may suffer, and the price of our securities may be affected, perhaps materially. Our limited rights of legal recourse and our lack of insurance protection over our Bitcoin expose us and our stockholders to the risk of loss of our Bitcoin for which there may be no adequate remedy. While we rely on a well-known U.S. based third party digital asset-focused custodian to safeguard our Bitcoin, our Bitcoin is not insured by us, including not being subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection. Accordingly, if our Bitcoin is lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to us, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy our claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for us might be limited, to the extent identifiable, to responsible third parties, such as a thief, terrorist or others, any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to our Bitcoin for which no recourse is available, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and, consequently, an investment in our securities.

 Our access to power is dependent on our electrical distribution provider, grid operator and regulator, which collectively manage whether our operations are performing in accordance with market rules, requirements and regulations, and any adverse determination or action by any such entity may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. PUCT, ERCOT, and Oncor collectively oversee the regulatory, administrative, and delivery aspects of our power supply in Texas. In recent years, regulatory scrutiny on Bitcoin mining facilities and their energy consumption has intensified as the practice has become more widespread. In April 2022, ERCOT established a task force to review the participation of large flexible loads, including Bitcoin mining data centers, in the ERCOT market. This task force is tasked with developing policy recommendations for ERCOT concerning network planning, market operations, and the interconnection processes for large flexible loads. As the grid operator, ERCOT is responsible for monitoring and testing market participants, including our Bitcoin mining data centers in Rockdale and Corsicana, to assess their impact on grid reliability. During this monitoring, ERCOT may determine that our data centers substantial power usage negatively affects grid reliability. If so, ERCOT could issue a curtailment order, requiring us to reduce or cease our power use immediately. Consequently, our power supply in Texas could be partially or fully curtailed. If we cannot secure adequate electrical power, we may be forced to reduce or shut down our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results and, consequently, an investment in our securities. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the three months ended September 30, 2024, certain of our employees surrendered shares of common stock awarded to them to satisfy statutory minimum federal and state tax obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock awards issued under our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan .

 CONFIDENTIAL 23 

a. digital units that are used as a medium of exchange or a form of digitally stored value Virtual Currency are not legal tender, and are not backed by the government; b. although this Agreement uses the term deposit, digital assets in the Digital Asset Account are not deposits within the meaning of U.S. federal or state banking law, and cash in the Cash Account are not deposits of Custodian. Balances of digital assets in the Digital Asset Account are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections; c. legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency; d. if any Custodied Digital Assets are deemed to be securities under state or Federal securities laws or if providing custody services or the ability to withdraw with respect to any Custodied Digital Asset would otherwise violate applicable state or federal laws, Custodian will make reasonable efforts to return such Custodied Digital Assets to Client but such Custodied Digital Assets may become temporarily or permanently inaccessible to Client; e. the software and cryptography that governs the protocols of Digital Asset Networks have short histories and could at any time be found ineffective or faulty, which could result in the complete loss of value or theft of the Custodied Digital Assets; f. no physical, operational and cryptographic system for the secure storage of private keys is perfectly secure, and loss or theft due to operational or other failure is always possible; g. transactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable; h. some Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that an Authorized Person provides an Instruction; i. the value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Virtual Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Virtual Currency should the market for that Virtual Currency disappear; j. there is no assurance that a Person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future; k. the volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to Fiat Currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time; l. the nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack; m. the nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by Custodian may prevent the access or use of Client s Virtual Currency; 
 CONFIDENTIAL 24 

n. any bond or trust account maintained by Custodian for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers; and o. for purposes of calculating Fees and for account statements, the fair market value of each Custodied Asset will be determined by Custodian according to its valuation policy, which may differ from the way that Client values its digital asset holdings. 18. Limitations of Liability (a) Neither Party will be liable to the other Party (whether under contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential losses suffered or incurred by the other Party (whether or not any such losses were foreseeable or within the contemplation of the Parties). (b) Neither Party s total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement will exceed the greater of (i) the fair market value of the amount of Custodied Assets at the time in which the events giving rise to the liability occurred and (ii) the fair market value of the amount of Custodied Assets at the time that Custodian notifies Client in writing or Client otherwise has actual knowledge of the events giving rise to the liability. The fair market value of each digital asset will be determined by Custodian according to its valuation policy, which may differ from the way that Client values its digital asset holdings. 19. Miscellaneous (a) Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which must be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement will become effective when each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties. Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party, this Agreement will have no effect and no Party will have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. (b) Electronic Documents. Client consents to the delivery of confirmations, any other required or optional communication or agreement under any Applicable Law by e-mail, Web site or other electronic means, including through the Portal, subject to compliance with Applicable Law. Any such documents that are delivered to Client electronically are deemed to be in writing. If Client s signature or acknowledgment is required or requested with respect to any such document and Client (if a natural person) or an authorized representative of Client clicks in the appropriate space, Client will be deemed to have signed or acknowledged the document to the same extent and with the same effect as if Client had signed the document manually. Client acknowledges its 
 CONFIDENTIAL 25 

understanding that Client has the right to withdraw its consent to the electronic delivery and signature of documents at any time by providing prior written notice. (c) Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any Party hereunder must be in writing (including e-mail transmission, so long as a confirmation of receipt of any e-mail transmission is requested and received) and must be given, if to Client, using Client Contact Info as given on the Term Sheet; if to Custodian, to: NYDIG Trust Company LLC One Vanderbilt Avenue, 65th Floor New York, NY 10017 Attention: [ ] E-mail: [ ] or such other address as a Party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the other Party. Each of the foregoing addresses will be effective unless and until notice of a new address is given by the applicable Party to the other Party in writing. Notice will not be deemed to be given unless it has been received. (d) Relationship of the Parties .

(e) Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and is to be construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflicts of law rules of that state. (f) Jurisdiction. The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New York City, so long as one of those courts has subject matter jurisdiction over the suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement will be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of those courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting 
 CONFIDENTIAL 26 

the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on that Party as provided in Section 19(c) will be deemed effective service of process on that Party. (g) Claims; Third-Party Beneficiaries . It is the intention of the Parties that no party other than the Parties will have or assert any rights, claims or remedies against any Party in respect of any action, omission, failure or neglect in the performance of any responsibilities referred to in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing sentence does not affect the right of any party to recover from Custodian pursuant to Section 10 the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses specified in Section 10. Custodian will advise Client as soon as reasonably practicable in the event any such claim is asserted by a third party against Custodian. (h) Modifications, Amendments and Waivers .

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Custodian may unilaterally waive any provision of this Agreement that it determines in good faith does not adversely affect Client. (iii) Custodian may change its internal policies and procedures, including its valuation policy, without notice to, or consent by, Client. However, to the extent of any conflict between this Agreement and updated policies and procedures, this Agreement shall control. (iv) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder operates as a waiver thereof nor may any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. (i) Headings; Internal References; Rule of Construction. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Appendices, such reference shall be to a Section or Appendix to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, whenever in this Agreement a Person is permitted or required to make a decision (i) in its sole discretion, discretion or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, the Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its 
 CONFIDENTIAL 27 

own interests or the interests of any other Person, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the any other Person; or (ii) in its good faith or under another express standard, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) the Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, under any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity. Further, whenever in this Agreement a Person is permitted or required to rely or to make a decision, determination, judgment or a similar action in good faith, such provision shall be satisfied by such Person s subjective belief as to the matter specified. (j) Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns but the Parties agree that no Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Custodian may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any affiliate of Custodian that is chartered or licensed to provide the Services or to any entity which succeeds to all or substantially all of the assets and business of Custodian without the prior written consent of Client. (k) Entire Agreement . This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, except that any non-disclosure agreement or agreements previously entered into between the Parties continue to be in force. (l) Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Services contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Services contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. (m) No Advice . Client acknowledges that Custodian is not providing, and it is not relying on Custodian to provide, any legal, tax, or investment advice in providing the Services.
