Concentration of Revenue 

The following table indicates the percentage of consolidated revenue represented by each customer that represented more than 10 percent of consolidated revenue in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Most of our customers have multi-year contracts with recurring revenue as well as professional services fees that vary by period depending on their business needs. 

Promissory Note with a privately held technology company and program manager in the FinTech industry. The note had an interest rate of percent annually and was paid in full in August 2023. In 2023, we entered into and advanced on a Promissory Note with a maturity date of October 2025 and an annual interest rate of percent. In the first quarter of 2024, we entered into and advanced a Promissory Note with a maturity date of October 2025 and an annual interest rate of percent. The carrying value of the current portion of our notes receivable of at September 30, 2024, is included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the noncurrent portion of our note receivable of as of September 30, 2024 is included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

percent ownership interest in a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry. The carrying value of our investment was at September 30, 2024, included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We account for this investment using the equity method of accounting which resulted in losses of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and losses of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, included in investment income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We evaluate on a continuing basis whether any impairment indicators are present that would require additional analysis or write-downs of the investment. While we have not recorded an impairment related to this investment as of September 30, 2024, variations from current expectations could result in future impairment charges. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of this investment exceeded our share of the investee s net assets by approximately million. Substantially all of this difference is comprised of goodwill and other intangible assets. 

In the second quarter of 2021, we invested in a privately held company that provides supply chain and receivables financing. During the third quarter of 2023, due to the failure of the business to successfully monetize its product offerings, we recorded an impairment charge of included in investment income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to reduce the carrying value of the investee company to as of September 30, 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, after the investee company signed its first revenue contracts, we invested an additional as part of a Series A-2 financing. 

and of stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Stock Options 

As of September 30, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options. There were no options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. No options expired unexercised during the quarter. The following table summarizes options as of September 30, 2024:

The estimated fair value of options granted is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions as previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company s closing stock price on the last trading day of the third quarter of 2024 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2024. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the market value of the Company s stock.

The Company classifies money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. government securities, asset-backed securities and corporate securities within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company values these investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. 

There were no transfers of financial instruments between the fair value hierarchy levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

The Company had one marketable security in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not identify any marketable securities that were other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not intend to sell any marketable securities that have an unrealized loss at September 30, 2024 and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such securities before any anticipated recovery.

Legal Matters 

There are no pending or threatened legal proceedings. However, in the ordinary course of business, from time to time we may be involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. We accrue for unpaid legal fees for services performed to date.

For purposes of this discussion and analysis, we are assuming and relying upon the reader s familiarity with the information contained in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Form 10- K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Overview 

CoreCard Corporation, a Georgia corporation, and its predecessor companies have operated since 1973 and its securities have been publicly traded since 1980. In this report, sometimes we use the terms Company , CoreCard , us , ours , we , Registrant and similar words to refer to CoreCard Corporation and subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located in Norcross, Georgia and our website is www.corecard.com. 

We are primarily engaged in the business of providing technology solutions and processing services to the financial technology and services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. Our revenue comes from a number of different offerings to companies in that industry, including the following: 

Licenses which allow a customer to use our software for a specified number of active accounts on the system; 

Professional services for development of new features or system functionality; 

Support and maintenance services tied to the number of active accounts under license; and 

Processing services based on the number of active accounts on the system. 

Our operations are conducted through our affiliate companies located in Romania, India, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia, as well as our corporate office in Norcross, Georgia which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support. CoreCard s foreign subsidiaries that perform software development and testing as well as processing operations support are CoreCard SRL in Romania, CoreCard Software Pvt Ltd in India, CoreCard Colombia SAS in Colombia and CoreCard Software DMCC in the United Arab Emirates. 

Our results vary in part depending on the size and number of software licenses recognized as well as the value and number of professional services contracts recognized in a particular period. As we continue to grow our Processing Services business, we continue to gain economies of scale on the investments we have made in the infrastructure, resources, processes and software features developed over the past number of years to support this growing side of our business. We are adding new processing customers at a faster pace than we are adding new license customers, resulting in steady growth in the processing revenue stream. 

We also receive license revenue and professional services revenue, including such revenue from Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Goldman ), which was added as a customer in 2018 and is referred to as Customer A in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In total, this customer represented 62 and 68 of our consolidated revenues in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. On October 23, 2024, we executed an Omnibus Amendment with Goldman covering the following agreements between the Company and Goldman: 

Software License and Support Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2018 (the SLSA 

Master Professional Services Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2019 (the MPSA , and together with the SLSA, the Agreements 

Schedule of Work No. 1 to Professional Services Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2019, and Amendment No. 2 to Schedule of Work No. 1, dated as of January 13, 2021 SOW 1 and 

Schedule of Work No. 2 to Professional Services Agreement, dated as of August 1, 2019, and Amendment No. 2 to Schedule of Work No. 2, dated as of January 13, 2021 SOW 2 , and together with SOW 1, the SOWs ). 

13

The Amendment, which is effective as of October 23, 2024, extends the Support Services term of the SLSA through December 31, 2030, and extends the term of the SOWs through December 31, 2030. Among other things, the Amendment also (i) provides for increased monthly fees under SOW 2 starting January 2025, and (ii) allows Goldman to terminate the agreements no earlier than January 1, 2027, with termination payments due if terminated prior to December 31, 2030. All other material terms of the Agreements and SOWs, as amended, remain unchanged. 

The amount and timing of future revenues from Goldman will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file and the level of customization needed by the customer and whether the customer continues the credit card line of business. License revenue from this customer, similar to other license arrangements, is tiered based on the number of active accounts on the system. Once the customer achieves each tier level, they receive a perpetual license up to that number of accounts; inactive accounts do not count toward the license tier. The customer receives an unlimited perpetual license at a maximum tier level that allows them to utilize the software for any number of active accounts. Support and maintenance fees are charged based on the tier level achieved and increase at new tier levels. 

Goldman recently announced the transition of its General Motors co-branded credit card to a new issuer, which is processed under our agreement with Goldman, with an expected close in 2025. Sale of the loans by Goldman will not affect the maintenance revenue that we receive under the agreement, which is set based on the most recently achieved license tier. However, the removal of active accounts following a sale of the loans will proportionately increase the number of accounts that will need to be added to earn the license fees attributable to the next license tier under the agreement. Additionally, selling one of their two portfolios could make it more likely that Goldman will exit the credit card business. 

The infrastructure of our multi customer environment is designed to be scalable for the future. A significant portion of our expense is related to personnel, including approximately 1,000 employees located in India, Romania, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia. In October 2020, we opened a new office in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates to support CoreCard s expansion of processing services into new markets in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and European regions. In October 2021, we opened a new location in Bogot , Colombia to support existing customers and continued growth. Our ability to hire and train employees on our processes and software impacts our ability to onboard new customers and deliver professional services for software customizations. In addition, we have certain corporate office expenses associated with being a public company that impact our operating results. 

Our revenue fluctuates from period to period and our results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods. It is difficult to predict the level of consolidated revenue on a quarterly or annual basis for a number of reasons, including the following: 

Software license revenue in a given period may consist of a relatively small number of contracts and contract values can vary considerably depending on the software product and scope of the license sold. Consequently, even minor delays in delivery under a software contract (which may be out of our control) could have a significant and unpredictable impact on the consolidated revenue that we recognize in a given quarterly or annual period. 

Customers may decide to postpone or cancel a planned implementation of our software for any number of reasons, which may be unrelated to our software or contract performance, but which may affect the amount, timing and characterization of our deferred and/or recognized revenue. 

Customers typically require our professional services to modify or enhance their CoreCard software implementation based on their specific business strategy and operational requirements, which vary from customer to customer and period to period. 

The timing of new processing customer implementations is often dependent on third party approvals or processes which are typically not under our direct control. 

We continue to believe that we have a strong cash position, and we intend to use cash balances to support the domestic and international operations associated with our CoreCard business and to expand our operations in the FinTech industry through financing the growth of CoreCard and, if appropriate opportunities become available, through acquisitions of businesses in this industry. In May 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board authorized a new 20 million share repurchase program, and we had approximately 9.3 million of authorized share repurchases remaining as of September 30, 2024.

Results of Operations 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this quarterly report. 

Revenue Total revenue in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 was 15,703,000 and 42,576,000, respectively, which represents an increase of 17 and a decrease of 3 percent compared to the respective periods in 2023. 

Revenue from services was 14,283,000 and 41,156,000 in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which represents an increase of 7 percent and a decrease of 2 percent compared to the respective periods in 2023. Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in the number and value of professional services contracts completed during the third quarter of 2024 and increased revenue from transaction processing services and software maintenance and support services in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in the number of customers and accounts on file. Revenue from transaction processing services, software maintenance and support services were greater in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, due to an increase in the number of customers and accounts on file and the acceleration of approximately 500,000 of processing revenue from a customer that was acquired in 2023 and, as a result, formally terminated their contract in the first quarter of 2024. This increase was offset by a decrease in the number and value of professional services contracts completed during the first nine months of 2024, primarily related to lower professional services revenue from our largest customer, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. We expect that processing services will continue to grow as our customer base increases; however, the time required to implement new customer programs could be delayed due to third party integration and approval processes and other factors. It is difficult to predict with accuracy the number and value of professional services contracts that our customers will require in a given period. Customers typically request our professional services to modify or enhance their CoreCard software implementation based on their specific business strategy and operational requirements, which vary from customer to customer and period to period. 

Revenue from products , which is primarily software license fees, was 1,420,000 in both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0 and 1,794,000 in the respective comparable periods of 2023. 

Cost of Revenue Total cost of revenue was 57 percent and 65 percent of total revenue in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 69 percent and 65 percent of total revenue in the corresponding periods of 2023. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by higher license revenue. Cost of revenue includes costs to provide annual maintenance and support services to our installed base of licensed customers, costs to provide professional services, and costs to provide our financial transaction processing services. The cost and gross margins on such revenues can vary considerably from period to period depending on the customer mix, customer requirements and project complexity as well as the mix of our U.S. and offshore employees working on the various aspects of services provided. In addition, we continue to devote the resources necessary to support our growing processing business, including direct costs for regulatory compliance, infrastructure, network certifications, and customer support. Investments in our infrastructure are in anticipation of adding customers in future periods. As such, we will not experience economies of scale unless we add additional customers, as anticipated. This may be subject to change in the future if new regulations or processing standards are implemented causing us to incur additional costs to comply. 

Operating Expenses In the three month and nine month period ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses from consolidated operations were higher by 6 and were flat compared to the corresponding period in 2023, respectively. In the three month period ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses from consolidated operations were higher than in the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were 16 percent higher in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher bonus accruals. Marketing expenses increased 25 percent and 30 percent for the three and nine month periods in 2024, respectively. Our client base continues to increase with minimal marketing efforts as we continue to have prospects contact us via online searches; however, we will continue to re-evaluate our marketing expenditures as needed to competitively position the Processing Services business. 

Investment Income (Loss) In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 90,000 and 528,000 of investment loss, respectively, compared to investment losses of 1,015,000 and 1,701,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The investment losses in 2024 relate to losses on our equity method investment. The investment losses in 2023 relate to a third quarter impairment charge on a cost method investment and losses on our equity method investment in a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry (see Note 4). The privately held company has incurred losses as they invest in future growth. 

Other Income (Loss) In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income of 233,000 and 758,000, respectively, compared to income of 308,000 and 653,000 for the comparable 2023 periods. 

15

Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 25.0 percent and 24.9 percent compared to effective tax rates of 24.5 percent and 24.8 percent for the respective periods in 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash and cash equivalent balance at September 30, 2024 was 22,498,000 compared to 26,918,000 at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operations was 5,039,000 compared to cash provided by operations of 18,252,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to lower accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances, lower depreciation and amortization and a non-cash impairment charge in the 2023 period that did not recur in 2024, partially offset by higher net income and higher stock compensation expense. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 1,831,000 in publicly traded multi sector corporate and municipal debt and treasury securities, offset by related maturities of 1,728,000, which is described in more detail in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 3,733,000 of cash, compared to 4,845,000 of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to acquire computer equipment and related software and for personnel and contractor development costs for the development of a new processing platform, to enhance our existing processing environment in the U.S., and a new data center in India for international operations. 

We expect to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand as well as projected customer payments to support our operations and capital equipment purchases in the foreseeable future. Currently we expect to use cash in excess of what is required for our current operations for opportunities we believe will expand our FinTech business, as exemplified by transactions described in Note 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, although there can be no assurance that appropriate opportunities will arise. In May 2022, the Board authorized an additional 20 million for our share repurchase program. We made share repurchases of 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and share repurchases of 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had approximately 9.3 million of authorized share repurchases remaining as of September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and valuation of investments to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. Management discusses its estimates and judgments with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. For a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). Reference is also made to the discussion of the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates contained in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant or material changes in the application of critical accounting policies. 

Factors That May Affect Future Operations 

Future operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future results of operations or projected cash requirements. It is difficult to predict future quarterly and annual results with certainty. 

Among the numerous factors that may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition are the following: 

Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., our largest customer, represented 62 of our consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the event of material failures to meet contract obligations related to the services provided, there is risk of breach of contract and loss of the customer and related future revenues. Additionally, loss of the customer and related future revenues or a reduction in revenues could result if they or their customers choose an alternative service provider, build an in-house solution, or decide to exit the business or service line that falls under the services that we provide for them. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. recently announced the transition of its General Motors co-branded credit card to a new issuer, with an expected close in 2025, which could make it more likely that they exit the credit card business. The General Motors program was added to their portfolio in the first quarter of 2022. 

16

Weakness or instability in the global financial markets could have a negative impact due to potential customers (most of whom perform some type of financial services) delaying decisions to purchase software or initiate processing services. 

Increased federal and state regulations and reluctance by financial institutions to act as sponsor banks for prospective customers could result in losses and additional cash requirements. 

Delays in software development projects could cause our customers to postpone implementations or delay payments, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenue and cash. 

We could fail to deliver software products which meet the business and technology requirements of our target markets within a reasonable time frame and at a price point that supports a profitable, sustainable business model. 

Our processing business is impacted, directly or indirectly, by more regulations than our licensed software business. If we fail to provide services that comply with (or allow our customers to comply with) applicable regulations or processing standards, we could be subject to financial or other penalties that could negatively impact our business. 

A security breach in our platform could expose confidential information of our customers account holders, hackers could seize our digital infrastructure and hold it for ransom or other cyber risk events could occur and create material losses in excess of our insurance coverage. 

Software errors or poor-quality control may delay product releases, increase our costs, result in non-acceptance of our software by customers or delay revenue recognition. 

We could fail to expand our base of customers as quickly as anticipated, resulting in lower revenue and profits and increased cash needs. 

We could fail to retain key software developers and managers who have accumulated years of know-how in our target markets and company products or fail to attract and train a sufficient number of new software developers and testers to support our product development plans and customer requirements at projected cost levels. 

Increasing and changing government regulations in the United States and foreign countries related to such issues as data privacy, financial and credit transactions could require changes to our products and services which could increase our costs and could affect our existing customer relationships or prevent us from getting new customers. 

Delays in anticipated customer payments for any reason would increase our cash requirements and could adversely impact our profits. 

Competitive pressures (including pricing, changes in customer requirements and preferences, and competitor product offerings) may cause prospective customers to choose an alternative product solution, resulting in lower revenue and profits (or losses). 

Our future capital needs are uncertain and depend on a number of factors; additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Volatility in the markets, including as a result of political instability, civil unrest, war or terrorism, or pandemics or other natural disasters, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus, could adversely affect future results of operations and could negatively impact the valuation of our investments. 

Other general economic and political conditions could cause customers to delay or cancel purchases. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no significant changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors identified in connection with this evaluation that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

17

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may be involved in certain claims and litigation arising out of the ordinary course and conduct of business. Management assesses such claims and, if it considers that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, provisions for loss are made based on management s assessment of the most likely outcome. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Repurchases of Securities 

In May 2022, the Board authorized an additional 20 million for our share repurchase program. Under this program, which was publicly announced in November 2018, we are authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We had approximately 9.3 million of authorized share repurchases remaining at September 30, 2024.
