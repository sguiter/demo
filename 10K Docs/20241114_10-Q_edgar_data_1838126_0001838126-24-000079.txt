 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about HPS Corporate Lending Fund (together, with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company , we or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies, including our and their ability to achieve our respective objectives as a result of inflation, increases in borrowing costs and a potential global recession; 
 the impact of geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the broader Middle East conflict; 
 the impact of the investments that we expect to make; 
 our ability to raise sufficient capital to execute our investment strategy; 
 our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 
 the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 
 changes in the general interest rate environment, including a sustained elevated interest rate environment, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve s intentions regarding interest rates in the upcoming year; 
 the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with HPS Advisors, LLC (the Adviser or any of its affiliates; 
 the elevated levels of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we invest; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 
 the availability of credit and/or our ability to access the capital markets; 
 our use of financial leverage; 
 the ability of the Adviser to source suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the ability of the Adviser or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
 our ability to qualify for and maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company and as a business development company BDC 
 the impact on our business of new or amended legislation or regulations; 
 currency fluctuations, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in currency other than U.S. dollars; 
 the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and 
 the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of any projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status.

 and portfolio companies on non-accrual status, respectively. 
 PIK Income 
 The Company has loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. Such income is included in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest is generally reversed through interest income. To maintain the Company s status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected cash. 
 Dividend Income 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities and on the Company s membership interests in its joint ventures are recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. To the extent a preferred equity security contains PIK provisions, PIK dividends, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable agreement, are accrued and recorded as dividend income and added to the principal balance of the preferred equity security.

 term ending on June 30, 2024 and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of the Company s outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the Independent Trustees. The Company may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon days written notice. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC guidance and interpretations. The Investment Advisory Agreement was most recently renewed and approved by the Board, on May 13, 2024, for a period ending on June 30, 2025. 
 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays the Adviser a fee for its services. The fee consists of components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee are ultimately borne by the shareholders. 
 Base Management Fee 
 
 The management fee is payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Company s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable month. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, net assets means the Company s total assets less the carrying value of liabilities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For the first calendar month in which the Company had operations, net assets were measured as the beginning net assets as of the date on which the Company broke escrow for the Offering. 
 
 The Adviser agreed to waive the base management fee from the date on which the Company broke escrow for the Offering through December 31, 2022. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, base management fees were million and million , respectively . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, base management fees were million and million , respectively . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, were payable to the Adviser related to management fees. 
 Incentive Fees 
 
 The incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Company s income and a portion is based on a pe rcentage of the Company s capital gains, each as described below. 
 
 (i) Income based incentive fee 
 
 The income based incentive fee is based on the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, as defined below. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means interest income, dividends, cash interest or other distributions or other cash income and any third-party fees received from portfolio companies (such as upfront fees, commitment fees, origination fee, amendment fees, ticking fees and break-up fees, as well as prepayments premiums, but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and an administration agreement with the administrator, any expense of securitizations, and interest expense or other financing fees and any dividends paid on preferred stock, but excluding incentive fees and shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero-coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or

 per quarter annualized). 
 
 The Company pays the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 
 i. No incentive fee will be paid on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the Hurdle Rate; 
 
 ii. of the dollar amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre- Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). This portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than is referred to as the Catch-Up. The Catch-Up is meant to provide the Adviser with of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a Hurdle Rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 
 iii. of the dollar amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). 
 These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months, including the first quarter the Company commenced operations, and are adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. 
 
 The Adviser agr eed to waive the income based incentive fee from the date on which the Company broke escrow for the Offering through December 31, 2022. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, income based incentive fees were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, income based incentive fees were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, were payable to the Adviser relating to income based incentive f ees. 
 
 (ii) Capital gains incentive fee 
 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. This U.S. GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then U.S. GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, capital gains incentive fees accrued were million and million , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, capital gains incentive fees accrued were million and million, respectively . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company accrued million and million, respectively, of capital gains incentive fees, none of which were payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement.

 The shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees are paid monthly in arrears, calculated using the net asset value of the applicable class as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the month and subject to FINRA and other limitations on underwriting compensation.

Because the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees with respect to Class D, Class F or Class S shares are calculated based on the aggregate net asset value for all of the outstanding shares of each such class, it reduces the net asset value with respect to all shares of each such class, including shares issued under the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. 
 Eligibility to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee is conditioned on a broker providing the following ongoing services with respect to the Class D, Class F or Class S shares: assistance with recordkeeping, answering investor inquiries regarding the Company, including regarding distribution payments and reinvestments, helping investors understand their investments upon their request, and assistance with share repurchase requests. If the applicable broker is not eligible to receive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee due to failure to provide these services, the Managing Dealer will waive the shareholder servicing fee and/or distribution that broker would have otherwise been eligible to receive.

 Note 5. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. 
 In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company applies the valuation policy approved by its Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Company evaluates the source of the inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. 
 Investments whose values are based on the listed closing price quoted on the securities principal exchange are classified within Level 1 and include active listed equities. The Adviser does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.

 (2) Weighted averages are calculated based on fair value of investments. 
 The significant unobservable input used in the yield analysis is the discount rate based on comparable market yields. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the recovery analysis is the recovery rate. The recovery rate represents the extent to which proceeds can be recovered and an increase or decrease in the recovery rate would result in an increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value. The significant unobservable input used in the enterprise value technique is the EBITDA multiple. Increases or decreases in market multiples would result in an increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which the Company will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Company on behalf of its shareholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Company declares a cash distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of our distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 Character of Distributions 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Company, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from the Adviser, which is subject to recoupment. 
 Through September 30, 2024, a portion of the Company s distributions resulted from expense support from the Adviser, and future distributions may result from expense support from the Adviser, each of which is subject to repayment by the Company within from the date of payment. The purpose of this arrangement avoids distributions being characterized as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should understand that any such distribution is not based solely on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Adviser continues to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that the Company s future repayments of expense support will

 Share Repurchase Program 
 The Company has commenced a share repurchase program in which the Company intends to repurchase, in each quarter, up to of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of the Company and the best interest of the shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the Company s share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, the Company expects to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at the Company s discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders across all shares.

 Overview and Investment Framework 
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on December 23, 2020 that commenced operations on February 3, 2022, we are externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments and monitoring our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Our Adviser is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HPS. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. 
 Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser an annual management fee as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. Also, under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including, but not limited to, our allocable portion of the costs of compensation (including salaries, bonuses and benefits) and related expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs. 
 
 Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, predominately in the form of current income, with select investments exhibiting the ability to capture long-term capital appreciation. Our investment strategy focuses primarily on newly originated, privately negotiated senior credit investments in high-quality, established upper middle market companies and, in select situations, companies in special situations. We use the term upper middle market companies to generally mean companies with EBITDA of 75 million to 1 billion annually or 250 million to 5 billion in revenue annually at the time of investment. We have and may continue to invest in smaller or larger companies if the opportunity presents attractive investment characteristics and risk-adjusted returns. While our investment strategy primarily focuses on companies in the United States, we also intend to leverage HPS s global presence to invest in companies in Europe, Australia and other locations outside the U.S., subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of assets in eligible portfolio companies. We also include a smaller allocation to more liquid credit investments such as broadly syndicated loans and corporate bonds. We intend to use these investments to maintain liquidity for our share repurchase program and to manage cash while seeking attractive returns before investing subscription proceeds into originated loans. We invest at least 80 of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in credit and credit-related instruments issued by corporate issuers (including loans, notes, bonds and other corporate debt securities). If we change our 80 test, we will provide shareholders with at least 60 days prior notice of such change. Although not expected to be a primary component of our investment strategy, in select situations, we may also make certain opportunistic investments in instruments other than secured debt with a view to enhancing returns, such as mezzanine debt, payment-in-kind notes, convertible debt and other unsecured debt instruments, structured debt that is not secured by financial or other assets, debtor-in-possession financings and equity in loan portfolios or portfolios of receivables Opportunistic Investments ), in each case taking into account availability of leverage for such investments and our target risk/return profile. In addition, we may also participate in programmatic investments through partnerships or joint ventures with one or more unaffiliated banks or other financial institutions, including structures where a partner assumes senior exposure to each investment, and we participate in the junior exposure. 
 
 Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by the Adviser or HPS. We expect to invest in co-investment transactions with other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by the Adviser or HPS. 
 
 To seek to enhance our returns, we employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Adviser, but we are subject to the limitations set forth in the 1940 Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to a 2:1 debt to equity ratio. We intend to use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from certain financial institutions and the issuance of debt securities. We may also use leverage in the form of the issuance of preferred shares, but do not currently intend to do so. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. Any such leverage, if incurred, would be expected to increase our total capital available for investment. 
 
 To finance investments, we have in the past and may in the future securitize certain of our secured loans or other investments, including through the formation of one or more CLOs, while retaining all or most of the subordinated notes issued in the securitization.

 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on senior secured loans and securities of private U.S. companies. Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and will vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to private companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly or quarterly. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue from various fees in the ordinary course of business such as in the form of structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication and other miscellaneous fees. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to: 
 
 investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 
 our allocable portion of compensation (including salaries, bonuses, and benefits), overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that performs duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of HPS or any of its affiliates; provided, that such expenses shall exclude (1) rent or depreciation, utilities, capital equipment and other administrative items of the Administrator, and (2) salaries, fringe benefits, travel expenses and other administrative items incurred or allocated to any Controlling Person (as defined in the Omnibus Guidelines) of the Administrator; 
 
 all other expenses of the Company s operations, administrations and transactions. 
 
 The Adviser agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf through February 3, 2022, the date on which we broke escrow for our initial offering of Common Shares. On such date, the Company became obligated to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses and the Adviser subsequently requested reimbursement of these expenses and was paid pursuant to the prior expense support agreement. After such date, the Company bears all such expenses, subject to the Expense Support Agreement. Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser is obligated to advance all of our Other Operating Expenses to the effect that such expenses do not exceed 1.00 (on an annualized basis) of the Company s NAV. We are obligated to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses (including any additional expenses the Adviser elects to pay on our behalf), subject to certain conditions. See Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement. Any reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. 
 
 From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers for goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses are ultimately borne by our shareholders. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 We have entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Adviser. F or additional information see Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements.

 Interest Expense 
 Total interest expense (including unused fees, original issue discounts and amortization of deferred financing costs) increased to 106.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 66.7 million for the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased borrowings under the Unsecured Notes and debt securitization issuances. The average principal debt outstanding increased to 4,794.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3,161.6 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Total interest expense (including unused fees, original issue discounts and amortization of deferred financing costs) increased to 281.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 178.2 million for the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased borrowings under the Unsecured Notes and debt securitization issuances. The average principal debt outstanding increased to 4,180.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2,978.2 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 Management Fees 
 Management fees increased to 24.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.7 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net assets. Management fees increased to 63.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 36.9 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in net assets. Management fees are payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of 1.25 of the value of our net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable m onth. 
 Income Based Incentive Fee 
 Income based incentive fees increased to 29.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.7 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to our deployment of capital and an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Income based incentive fees increased to 81.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 50.1 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to our deployment of capital and an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. 
 Capital Gains Incentive Fees 
 U.S. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at 
 99 

Table of Contents 

 the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 12.5 of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. 
 Capital gains based incentive fees decreased to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.2 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher net unrealized gains earned in the prior year period relative to the current period, none of which were payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Capital gains based incentive fees increased to 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.2 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to net unrealized gains on investments, none of which were payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Other Expenses 
 Organization costs and offering costs include expenses incurred in our initial formation and our continuous offering. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service expenses represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers, their respective staff and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, our sub-administrator, subscriptions and other costs. 
 Total other expenses increased to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.4 million for the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase of professional fees, administrative service expenses and other general administrative expenses due to servicing a growing portfolio. 
 Total other expenses increased to 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 11.5 million for the same period in the prior year primarily driven by an increase of administrative service expenses and other general administrative expenses due to servicing a growing portfolio. 
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement and Investment Advisory Agreement, we reimburse the Administrator and Adviser, respectively, for services performed for us. In addition, pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Administrator and Adviser may delegate its obligations under these agreements to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Administrator and Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Administrator charged 0.9 million, an increase from 0.5 million for the same period in the prior year, for certain costs and expenses allocable to the Company under the terms of the Administration Agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Administrator charged 2.6 million, an increase from 1.6 million for the same period in the prior year, for certain costs and expenses allocable to the Company under the terms of the Administration Agreement. 
 
 Shareholder servicing and/or distributions fees increased to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.8 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in shares outstanding. Shareholder servicing and/or distributions fees increased to 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.2 million for the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in shares outstanding. 
 
 We entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify each taxable year for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income (if any) for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal

 excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred U.S. federal excise tax of 3.6 million and 0.9 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred U.S. federal excise tax of 4.2 million and 0.9 million, respectively. 
 Net Realized Gain (Loss) 
 Net realized gains and losses were comprised of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments (4,548) (6,383) (16,022) (16,749) Foreign currency forward contracts (763) 5,924 (3,417) (1,757) Foreign currency transactions 791 (6,721) 9,912 (6,863) Net realized gain (loss) (4,520) (7,180) (9,527) (25,369) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated net realized gains (losses) of (4.5) million, driven primarily by net realized losses of (5.5) million from the sales of syndicated loans, offset by a 0.4 million gains on sales of private debt investments and foreign currency realized gains of 0.5 million on investments (included in realized losses on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments) primarily due to the sale of a EUR denominated investment. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated net realized gains (losses) of (9.5) million, driven by net realized losses on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments of (8.9) million primarily from the sales of syndicated loans and bonds and the restructuring of a private debt investment, and foreign currency realized losses of (7.1) million on investments (included in realized losses on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments) primarily due to a repayment of a AUD denominated investment. We generated realized losses on foreign currency forwards contracts, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the AUD, EUR and GBP exchange rates. Realized losses were partially offset by 9.9 million of gains on foreign currency transactions, as a result of repayments of foreign borrowings and conversions of foreign cash balances, primarily attributable to fluctuations in the AUD, EUR, GBP and CAD exchange rates. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated net realized gains (losses) of (7.2) million and (25.4) million, respectively, which was primarily comprised of net realized losses on broadly syndicated loans, the restructuring of debt investments, foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency transactions. 
 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 
 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) was comprised of the following: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Non-controlled/non-affiliated investments 72,233 47,292 110,952 163,282 Non-controlled/affiliated investments 31 (225) 405 (225) Controlled/affiliated investments 7,763 20,685 Foreign currency forward contracts (49,758) 4,931 (32,510) 5,835 Translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies (22,335) 32,986 (10,363) 25,493 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) 7,934 84,984 89,169 194,385 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of the investment portfolio remained relatively flat as there were net unrealized gains of 4.6 million, excluding the impact of foreign currency. The remaining 3.3 million represents the net unrealized gains as a result of foreign currency fluctuations impacting the value of the investment portfolio, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign debt and cash balances. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the fair value of our debt investments increased due to spread tightening in both the public and private credit markets.

Table of Contents 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of the investment portfolio increased 79.6 million primarily resulting from spread tightening in both the public and private credit markets. The remaining 9.6 million represents the net unrealized gains as a result of foreign currency fluctuations impacting the value of the investment portfolio, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign debt and cash balances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the fair value of our debt investments increased due to spread tightening in both the public and private credit markets. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 We use interest rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the Company's fixed rate liabilities. We have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship. See our schedule of investments for additional disclosure regarding these derivative instruments. See Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Borrowings for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of our debt.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our continuous offering of Common Shares, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facilities, unsecured debt issuances, debt securitization issuances , income earned and repayments on principal on our debt investments. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (i) originating and purchasing debt investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to our Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of our borrowings, (iv) funding repurchases under our share repurchase program and (v) cash distributions to our shareholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had several asset-based leverage facilities, a corporate-level revolving credit facility, unsecured note issuances and debt securitization issuances . From time to time, we may enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities and/or issue debt securities, including additional unsecured notes and debt securitizations. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate amount of 5,533.4 million and 4,210.4 million, respectively, of debt outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 242.5 and 223.2 , respectively. We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our 2,164.6 million of available capacity under our credit facilities (subject to borrowing base availability) and the continuous offering of our Common Shares is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. This determination is based in part on our expectations for the timing of funding investment purchases and the timing and amount of future proceeds from sales of our Common Shares and the use of existing and future financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we had significant amounts payable and commitments for existing and new investments, which we planned to fund using proceeds from offering our Common Shares and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities. Additionally, we held 1,199.4 million of syndicated loans and other liquid investments as of September 30, 2024, which could provide additional liquidity if necessary. 
 Although we were able to close on credit facilities and issue debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, any disruption in the financial markets or any other negative economic development could restrict our access to financing in the future. We may not be able to find new financing for future investments or liquidity needs and, even if we are able to obtain such financing, such financing may not be on as favorable terms as we could have obtained in the past. These factors may limit our ability to make new investments and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 228.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 3,262.1 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of 5,238.4 million and partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments and principal repayments of 1,795.8 million and other operating uses of 180.6 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 3,301.3 million during the period, primarily as a result of new share issuances related to 2,530.1 million of subscriptions and net borrowings (repayments) of 1,313.4 million.

 With respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared cash distribution or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. The following table reflects the sources of cash distributions on a U.S. GAAP basis that we declared on our Common Shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Share Repur chase Program 
 At the discretion of the Board, we have commenced a share repurchase program in which we may repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of the NAV of our Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the best interest of shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on us as a whole that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, it is expected to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at our discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by us for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Investments and Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. 
 Investments that are listed or traded on an exchange and are freely transferable are valued at either the closing price (in the case of securities and futures) or the mean of the closing bid and offer (in the case of options) on the principal exchange on which the investment is listed or traded. Investments for which other market quotations are readily available will typically be valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Where it is possible to obtain reliable, independent market quotations from a third party vendor, the Company uses these quotations to determine the value of its investments. The Company utilizes mid-market pricing (i.e., mid-point of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. The Adviser obtains these market quotations from independent pricing services, if available; otherwise from one or more broker quotes. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. 
 
 Where prices or inputs are not available or, in the judgment of the Adviser, not reliable, valuation approaches based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available, as will be the case for a substantial portion of the Company s investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, pursuant to the Company s valuation 
 114 

Table of Contents 

 policy, and under the oversight of the Board, based on, among other things, the input of one or more independent valuation firms retained by the Company to review the Company s investments. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments complexity. 
 With respect to the quarterly valuation of investments, the Company undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each quarter, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser s valuation team in consultation with the Adviser s investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment; 
 In addition, independent valuation firms retained by the Company prepare quarter-end valuations of each such investment that was (i) originated or purchased prior to the first calendar day of the quarter and (ii) is not a de minimis investment, as determined by the Adviser. The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations; 
 The Adviser s valuation committee with respect to the Company (the Valuation Committee reviews the valuation recommendations prepared by the Adviser s valuation team and, as appropriate, the independent valuation firms valuation ranges; 
 The Adviser s Valuation Committee then determines fair value marks for each of the Company s portfolio investments; and 
 The Board and Audit Committee periodically review the valuation process and provide oversight in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 
 As part of the valuation process, the Company takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, generally based on an analysis of discounted cash flows, publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and (v) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Adviser considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 The Company has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of the Company s portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Company and the Adviser may reasonably rely on that assistance. However, the Adviser is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company s valuation policy, the Board s oversight and a consistently applied valuation process. 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. 
 The Company s accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to the Company s consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the consolidated financial statements. 
 See Note 5. Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the fair value of the Company s investments.

 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firms retained by the Company, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to

 liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 99.1 of our performing debt investments at fair value were at floating rates. Additionally, we entered into interest rate swaps with certain of our Unsecured Notes in order to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio. Based on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments) and assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income Up 300 basis points 377,847 (160,768) 217,079 Up 200 basis points 251,898 (107,179) 144,719 Up 100 basis points 125,949 (53,589) 72,360 Down 100 basis points (125,949) 53,589 (72,360) Down 200 basis points (251,286) 107,179 (144,107) Down 300 basis points (374,713) 160,768 (213,945) 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in Item 1A Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as well as the risk factors set forth in Risk Factors of our registration statement on Form N-2 filed on June 12, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors set forth in Risk Factors of our registration statement on Form N-2 filed on June 12, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Except as described and as previously reported by the Company on its current reports on Form 8-K, we did not sell any securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 We have commenced a share repurchase program in which we intend to offer to repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board of Trustees may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company as a whole, or should we otherwise determine that investing our liquid assets in originated loans or other illiquid investments rather than repurchasing our shares is in the best interests of the Company as a whole. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. We intend to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 Under our share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of such NAV. 
 
 The following table sets forth information regarding repurchases of shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Offer Date Repurchase Deadline Request Purchase Price per Share Number of Shares Repurchased (all classes) Amount Repurchased (all classes) February 1, 2024 March 1, 2024 25.36 2,347,231 1.13 May 1, 2024 May 30, 2024 25.52 2,204,546 0.89 August 1, 2024 August 29, 2024 25.56 1,766,987 0.64
