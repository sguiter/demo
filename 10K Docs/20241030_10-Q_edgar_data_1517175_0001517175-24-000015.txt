 The higher effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2023 was primarily driven by a 2.1 million charge in the prior year period for return-to-provision adjustments identified in the completion of our fiscal 2022 tax return and the impact of those adjustments on the fiscal 2023 estimated annual effective tax rate.

 Other Operating Expenses, Net 
 2024 2023 Change Change Other operating expenses, net 3,385 8,269 (4,884) (59.1)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We finance our day-to-day operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and other indebtedness, operating leases, trade payables and equity financing. 
 
 Indebtedness 
 
 The following table presents selected financial information on our indebtedness (in thousands): 
 September 27, 2024 December 29, 2023 Senior secured term loan 262,750 276,250 Total convertible debt 327,184 327,184 Borrowings outstanding on asset-based loan facility 100,000 100,000 Finance leases and other financing obligations 55,651 31,892 
 
 Recent Financing Transactions 
 
 In March 2024, we amended our senior secured term loan agreement, which reduced the interest rate spread by 75 basis points on our senior secured term loan facility. On October 22, 2024, we further amended our senior secured term loan agreement, which reduced the interest rate spread by an additional 50 basis points. Additionally, during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2024, we made voluntary principal prepayments of 12.0 million towards the senior secured term loan. 
 
 During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2024, we made a scheduled principal payment of 5.0 million towards the unsecured note issued in connection with the GreenLeaf acquisition. The note is presented under the caption Finance leases and other financing obligations in the table above. 
 
 In November 2023, we announced a two-year share repurchase program in an amount up to 100.0 million, targeting 25.0 million to 100.0 million of share repurchases by the end of fiscal 2025. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2024, we repurchased and retired 264,076 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of 37.86 per share. The share repurchases were funded by our available cash. The remaining share purchase authorization was 90.0 million at September 27, 2024. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and may suspend or discontinue the program at any time.

Liquidity 
 
 The following table presents selected financial information on liquidity (in thousands): 
 September 27, 2024 December 29, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 50,705 49,878 Working capital (1) , excluding cash and cash equivalents 
 312,496 295,288 Availability under asset-based loan facility 170,623 172,030 
 (1) We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. 
 
 We expect our capital expenditures, excluding cash paid for acquisitions, for fiscal 2024 will be approximately 45.0 million to 50.0 million. We believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, working capital and the availability under our asset-based loan facility, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service and other liquidity requirements associated with our current operations over the next twelve months. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents selected financial information on cash flows (in thousands): 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 80,057 20,045 Net cash used in investing activities (41,446) (155,730) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (37,826) 10,473 
 
 Our cash provided by operating activities is predominately driven by net sales to our customers. Our cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our payments to suppliers for our inventory, employee compensation, payments to support our facilities, our distribution network, interest on our indebtedness, payments to tax authorities and other general corporate expenditures. Net cash provided by operations was 80.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2024 compared to 20.0 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to sales growth and lower inventory purchase levels in the current period as the prior year results included a strategic pull forward of inventory purchases that did not recur. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 41.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2024, driven by capital expenditures of 41.1 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 37.8 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2024 driven by 18.5 million of payments of debt and other financing obligations, 10.0 million used to repurchase our common stock, 7.4 million paid for shares surrendered to pay tax withholding related to the vesting of equity incentive plan awards, 3.8 million of earn-out payments and 5.0 million of finance lease payments, partially offset by 6.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.
