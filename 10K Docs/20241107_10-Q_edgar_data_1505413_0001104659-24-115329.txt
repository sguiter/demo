VOC ENERGY TRUST 

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

Note 1. Organization of the Trust 

VOC Energy Trust (the Trust is a
statutory trust formed on November 3, 2010 (capitalized on December 17, 2010) under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant
to a Trust Agreement dated November 3, 2010 (as amended and restated on May 10, 2011, the Trust Agreement among
VOC Brazos Energy Partners, L.P., a Texas limited partnership VOC Brazos ), as trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the Trustee ), and Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the Delaware Trustee ).
The Trust was created to acquire and hold a term net profits interest for the benefit of the Trust unitholders. 

VOC Brazos is a privately held limited partnership
engaged in the production and development of oil and natural gas from properties located in Texas. VOC Kansas Energy Partners, L.L.C.,
a Kansas limited liability company VOC Kansas ), is a privately held limited liability company engaged in the production
and development of oil and natural gas from properties primarily located in Kansas along with a limited number of Texas properties. In
connection with the closing of the initial public offering of units of beneficial interest in the Trust Trust Units in
May 2011, VOC Brazos acquired all of the membership interests in VOC Kansas in exchange for newly issued limited partner interests
in VOC Brazos pursuant to a Contribution and Exchange Agreement, dated August 30, 2010, as amended, by and between VOC Brazos and
VOC Kansas. This resulted in VOC Kansas becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of VOC Brazos. 

The Trust was created to acquire and hold a term
net profits interest representing the right to receive 80 of the net proceeds (calculated as described below in Note 5) from production
from the underlying properties (as defined below). The net profits interest consists of working interests in substantially all of the
oil and natural gas properties held by VOC Brazos and VOC Kansas in the States of Kansas and Texas as of the date of the conveyance of
the net profits interest to the Trust. We refer to the properties in which the Trust holds the net profits interest as the underlying
properties. 

The net profits interest is passive in nature,
and the Trustee has no management control over and no responsibility relating to the operation of the underlying properties. The net profits
interest entitles the Trust to receive 80 of the net proceeds attributable to VOC Brazos interest from the sale of production
from the underlying properties during the term of the Trust. The net profits interest will terminate on the later to occur of (1) December 31,
2030 or (2) the time when 10.6 million barrels of oil equivalent MMBoe (which is the equivalent of 8.5 MMBoe
in respect of the net profits interest) have been produced from the underlying properties and sold, and the Trust will soon thereafter
wind up its affairs and terminate. 

As of September 30, 2024, cumulatively, since
inception, the Trust has received payment for 80 of the net proceeds attributable to VOC Brazos interest from the sale of 9.0
MMBoe of production from the underlying properties (which is the equivalent of 7.2 MMBoe in respect of the net profits interest). 

The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money
to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the Trust that exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow
from the Trustee or the Delaware Trustee as a lender provided the terms of the loan are similar to the terms it would grant to a similarly
situated commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting distribution
in an account with itself and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. 

Note 2. Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying Statement of Assets and Trust
Corpus as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim financial statements
as of September 30, 2024 and for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, have been prepared pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Accordingly, certain information
and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. 

The preparation of financial statements requires
the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trustee believes such information includes all the disclosures necessary to make
the information presented not misleading. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of the Trustee,
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim period presented. The financial information should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023.

Note 3. Trust Accounting Policies 

The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting
to report receipts of the net profits interest and payments of expenses incurred. The net profits interest represents the right to receive
revenues (oil and natural gas sales), less direct operating expenses (lease operating expenses, lease maintenance, lease overhead, and
production and property taxes) and an adjustment for lease equipment costs and lease development expenses (which are capitalized in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ))
of the underlying properties, times 80 . Actual cash receipts may vary due to timing delays of actual cash receipts from the property
operators or purchasers and due to wellhead and pipeline volume balancing agreements or practices. The actual cash distributions of the
Trust will be made based on the terms of the conveyance that created the Trust s net profits interest. Expenses of the Trust, which
include accounting, engineering, legal and other professional fees, Trustee fees, an administrative fee paid to VOC Brazos and out-of-pocket
expenses, are recognized when paid. Under U.S. GAAP, revenues and expenses would be recognized on an accrual basis. Amortization of the
investment in net profits interest is recorded on a unit-of-production method in the period in which the cash is received with respect
to such production. Such amortization does not reduce distributable income, rather it is charged directly to Trust corpus. 

This comprehensive basis of accounting other than
U.S. GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,
Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. 

Investment in the net profits interest was recorded
initially at the historical cost of VOC Brazos and is periodically assessed to determine whether its aggregate value has been impaired
below its total capitalized cost based on the underlying properties. The Trust will provide a write-down to its investment in the net
profits interest if and when total capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization, exceeds undiscounted future net revenues attributable
to the proved oil and gas reserves of the underlying properties. There was no impairment of the investment in the net profits interest
during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

No new accounting pronouncements were adopted or
issued during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that would impact the financial statements of the Trust. 

Note 4. Investment in Net Profits Interest 

The net profits interest was recorded at the historical
cost of VOC Brazos on May 10, 2011, the date of the conveyance of the net profits interest to the Trust, and was calculated as follows:

 12,337,945 

(1) Excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs reflect expenses and costs incurred by
VOC Brazos during each of the March through May production periods for the three months ended September 30 and during each
of the September through May production periods for the nine months ended September 30. Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance
of the net profits interest, lease equipment and development costs are to be deducted when calculating the distributable income to the
Trust. 

(2) Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance of the net profits interest, VOC Brazos can reserve up to 1.0 million for future development,
maintenance or operating expenditures at any time. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, VOC Brazos did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust from the reserve. The
reserve balance was 1.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 (3) The income from net profits interest is based upon the cash receipts from VOC Brazos for the oil and gas production. The revenues
from oil production are typically received by VOC Brazos one month after production; thus, the cash received by the Trust during the three
months ended September 30, 2024 substantially represents production by VOC Brazos from March 2024 through May 2024, and
the cash received by the Trust during the three months ended September 30, 2023 substantially represents production by VOC Brazos
from March 2023 through May 2023. The cash received by the Trust during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 substantially
represents production by VOC Brazos from September 2023 through May 2024, and the cash received by the Trust during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 substantially represents production by VOC Brazos from September 2022 through May 2023. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, MV Purchasing, LLC, an affiliate of VOC Brazos, purchased a significant portion of the production of the underlying properties.
Sales to MV Purchasing, LLC are under short-term arrangements, ranging from one to six months, using market sensitive pricing.

Note 6. Income Taxes 

The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust and is
not required to pay federal or state income taxes. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes has been made. 

Note 7. Distributions to Unitholders 

VOC Brazos makes quarterly payments of the net
profits interest to the Trust. The Trustee determines for each quarter the amount available for distribution to the Trust unitholders.
This distribution is expected to be made on or before the 45th day following the end of each quarter to the Trust unitholders of record
on the 30th day of the month following the end of each quarter (or the next succeeding business day). Such amounts will be equal to the
excess, if any, of the cash received by the Trust relating to the preceding quarter, over the expenses of the Trust paid for such quarter,
subject to adjustments for changes made by the Trustee during such quarter in any cash reserves established for future expenses of the
Trust. From the first quarter of 2022 to the second quarter of 2023, the Trustee withheld a portion of the proceeds otherwise available
for distribution each quarter to build an approximately 1.175 million cash reserve for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent
expenses or liabilities of the Trust. The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted amount at any time and may increase or decrease
the rate at which it is withholding funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance notice to the unitholders. Cash held
in reserve will be invested as required by the Trust Agreement. Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary to pay or provide
for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to unitholders, together
with interest earned on the funds. This cash reserve is included in cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying Statements of Assets
and Trust Corpus. 

The first quarterly distribution during 2024 was
 3,230,000, or 0.19 per Trust Unit, and was made on February 14, 2024 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of January 30, 2024.
Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by VOC Brazos from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. 

The second quarterly distribution during 2024 was
 3,060,000, or 0.18 per Trust Unit, and was made on May 15, 2024 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of April 30, 2024. Such distribution
included the net proceeds of production collected by VOC Brazos from January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024. 

The third quarterly distribution during 2024 was
 3,060,000, or 0.18 per Trust Unit, and was made on August 14, 2024 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of July 30, 2024.
Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by VOC Brazos from April 1, 2024 through June 30, 2024. 

The first quarterly distribution during 2023 was
 3,910,000, or 0.23 per Trust Unit, and was made on February 14, 2023 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of January 30,
2023. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by VOC Brazos from October 1, 2022 through December 31,
2022 and was net of 231,030 withheld by the Trustee towards the building of the cash reserve described above and with that amount, the
targeted reserve was fully funded. 

The second quarterly distribution during 2023 was
 3,910,000, or 0.23 per Trust Unit, and was made on May 12, 2023 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of May 1, 2023.
Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by VOC Brazos from January 1, 2023 through March 31,
2023. 

The third quarterly distribution during 2023 was
 3,570,000, or 0.21 per Trust Unit, and was made on August 14, 2023 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of August 1,
2022. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production collected by VOC Brazos from April 1, 2023 through June 30,
2023.

Note 8. Advance for Trust Expenses 

Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee
is allowed to borrow money to pay Trust expenses. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were
no borrowings or amounts owed for money borrowed in previous quarters. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, VOC Brazos has provided
a letter of credit in the amount of 1.7 million to the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient
cash to pay future expenses. 

Note 9. Subsequent Events 

On October 17, 2024, the Trust announced a
Trust distribution of net profits for the quarterly payment period ended September 30, 2024. Unitholders of record on October 30,
2024 will receive a distribution amounting to 3,060,000, or 0.18 per Trust Unit, which will be paid on November 14, 2024. 

Item 2. Trustee s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

or 0.3 from 9,240,585 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues are a function of oil and natural gas volumes sold
and prices received. The increase in gross proceeds was due to an increase in the market price for oil sales partially offset by decreases
in oil and natural gas sales volumes and the market price for natural gas sales during the third quarter of 2024. During the three months
ended September 30, 2024, the average price for oil increased 9.6 to 78.36 per Bbl and the average price for natural gas decreased
5.8 to 2.74 per Mcf. Oil sales volumes were 116,006 Bbls for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10,367
Bbls or 8.2 from 126,373 Bbls for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while natural gas sales volumes were 65,815 Mcf,
a decrease of 5,149 Mcf or 7.3 from 70,964 Mcf for the same period in 2023. 

Costs .
Lease operating expenses were 3,784,091 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 230,900 or 6.5 from 3,553,191
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Production and property taxes were 539,469 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, a decrease of 118,015 or 17.9 from 657,484 for the same period in 2023. Such decrease is the result of a decrease of 72,803
or 29.2 in production taxes due primarily to lower sales volumes for oil and natural gas and a decrease of 45,212 or 11.1 in property
taxes. Development expenses were 699,074 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 403,103 or 136.2 from 295,971
for the same period in 2023. Such increase was primarily due to increased development activity during the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Excess
of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs . The excess of revenues over direct operating
expenses and lease equipment and development costs from the underlying properties was 4,248,273 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, a decrease of 485,666 or 10.3 from 4,733,939 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Trust s 80 net profits
interest of these totals was 3,398,618 and 3,787,151, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
VOC Brazos did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust from the previously established cash reserve for future development,
maintenance or operating expenditures, which resulted in income from the net profits interest of 3,398,618 and 3,787,151 for such periods,
respectively. These amounts were reduced by a Trustee holdback for current estimated Trust expenses of 338,618 and 217,151 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Trustee paid general and administrative expenses of 202,488 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 54,732 from 257,220 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These
factors resulted in distributable income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 3,060,000, a decrease of 510,000 from
 3,570,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The cash received by the Trust from VOC Brazos
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 substantially represents the production by VOC Brazos from September 2023 through
May 2024. The cash received by the Trust from VOC Brazos during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 substantially
represents the production by VOC Brazos from September 2022 through May 2023. The revenues from oil production are typically
received by VOC Brazos one month after production. 

Gross
proceeds . Oil and natural gas sales were 27,041,669 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of
 2,751,509 or 9.2 from 29,793,178 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues are a function of oil and natural
gas volumes sold and prices received. The decrease in gross proceeds was due to decreases in oil and natural gas sales volumes and
in the market price for natural gas sales partially offset by a slight increase in the market price for oil sales during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average price for oil increased 1.2 to
 77.10 per Bbl and the average price for natural gas decreased 44.3 to 3.03 per Mcf. Oil sales volumes were 342,945 Bbls for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 31,799 Bbls or 8.5 from 374,744 Bbls for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, while natural gas sales volumes were 198,544 Mcf, a decrease of 30,565 Mcf or 13.3 from 229,109 Mcf for the same period in
2023. These oil and natural gas sales volume decreases are partially the result of severe winter storms in January 2024 that affected
Kansas and Texas and resulted in a curtailment of production on certain of the underlying properties, as discussed in the Trust s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 19, 2024. The snow and ice associated with those storms disabled electrical power to the affected
underlying properties for an extended period, rendering some properties inaccessible, and generally created difficult working conditions. 

Costs . 
Lease operating expenses were 11,004,093 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 209,285 or 1.9 from 11,213,378
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Production and property taxes were 1,557,681 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, a decrease of 273,245 or 14.9 from 1,830,926 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Such decrease is the result of
a decrease of 201,827 or 24.1 in production taxes due primarily to lower sales volumes for oil and natural gas and a decrease of 71,418
or 7.2 in property taxes. Development expenses were 1,504,651 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 178,208
or 13.4 from 1,326,443 for the same period in 2023. Such increase was primarily due to increased development activity during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Excess
of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs. The excess of revenues over direct
operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs from the underlying properties was 12,975,244 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2,447,187 or 15.9 from 15,422,431 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
Trust s 80 net profits interest of these totals was 10,380,195 and 12,337,945, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, VOC Brazos did not withhold or release any dollar amounts due to the Trust from the previously established cash reserve
for future development, maintenance or operating expenditures, which resulted in income from the net profits interest of 10,380,195 and
 12,337,945 for such periods, respectively. These amounts were reduced by a Trustee holdback for current estimated Trust expenses of 1,030,195
and 716,915 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a Trustee holdback for future estimated Trust
expenses of 231,030 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Trustee paid general and administrative expenses of 679,784
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 188,864 from 868,648 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
These factors resulted in distributable income of 9,350,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 11,390,000 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Other than Trust administrative expenses, including
any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, the Trust s only use of cash is for distributions to Trust unitholders.
Administrative expenses include payments to the Trustee as well as a quarterly administrative fee to VOC Brazos pursuant to an administrative
services agreement. Each quarter, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the
excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the net profits interest and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved
by the Trustee) in that quarter, over the Trust s expenses paid for that quarter. Available funds are reduced by any cash that
the Trustee decides to reserve for future development, maintenance or operating expenses. As of September 30, 2024, the Trustee held
 1,779,712 as cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying Statements of Assets and Trust Corpus, which includes the 1.175 million cash
reserve described below, as such a reserve. 

The Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow funds
required to pay expenses if the Trustee determines that the cash on hand and the cash to be received are insufficient to cover the Trust s
expenses. If the Trust borrows funds, the Trust unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no such borrowings. VOC Brazos has provided a letter of credit
in the amount of 1.7 million to the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient cash to pay future
expenses. 

From the first quarter of 2022 to the second quarter
of 2023, the Trustee withheld a portion of the proceeds otherwise available for distribution each quarter to build an approximately 1.175
million cash reserve for the payment of future known, anticipated, or contingent expenses or liabilities of the Trust. This amount is
in addition to the 1.7 million letter of credit described above. The Trustee may increase or decrease the targeted amount at any time
and may increase or decrease the rate at which it withholds funds to build the cash reserve at any time, without advance notice to the
unitholders. Cash held in reserve will be invested as required by the Trust Agreement. Any cash reserved in excess of the amount necessary
to pay or provide for the payment of future known, anticipated or contingent expenses or liabilities eventually will be distributed to
unitholders, together with interest earned on the funds. 

Income to the Trust from the net profits interest
is based on the calculation and definitions of gross proceeds and net proceeds contained in the conveyance. 

As substantially all of the underlying properties
are located in mature fields, VOC Brazos does not expect future costs for the underlying properties to change significantly compared to
recent historical costs other than changes due to fluctuations in the general cost of oilfield services. VOC Brazos may establish
a cash reserve of up to 1,000,000 in the aggregate at any given time from the dollar amount otherwise distributable to the Trust to reduce
the impact on distributions of uneven capital expenditure timing. The cash reserve balance was 1,000,000 at September 30, 2024 and
2023.

the Trust s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. The Trustee notes for purposes of clarification that it has no authority
