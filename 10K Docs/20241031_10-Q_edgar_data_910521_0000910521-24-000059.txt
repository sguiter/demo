 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for our second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 (Quarterly Report), and the information and documents incorporated by reference within this Quarterly Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), which statements are subject to considerable risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements other than statements of historical fact contained in, or incorporated by reference within, this Quarterly Report. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, should, will, or would, and similar expressions or the negative of these expressions. Specifically, this Quarterly Report, and the information and documents incorporated by reference within this Quarterly Report, contain forward-looking statements relating to, among other things: 
 
 changes in consumer preferences impacting our brands and products, and the footwear and fashion industries; 
 global economic trends, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in interest rates, inflationary pressures, changes in commodity pricing, and recessionary concerns; 
 the ability to effectively compete in a highly competitive footwear, apparel, and accessories industry; 
 our business, operating, investing, capital allocation, marketing, and financing plans and strategies; 
 the operational challenges faced by our warehouses and distribution centers (DCs), wholesale partners, global third-party logistics providers (3PLs), and third-party carriers, including as a result of global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages; 
 trends, seasonality, and weather impacting the demand for our products and the purchasing behavior of wholesale partners and consumers; 
 changes to the geographic and seasonal mix of our brands and products; 
 availability of materials and manufacturing capacity, and reliability of overseas production and storage; 
 changes to our product distribution strategies, including product allocation and segmentation strategies; 
 the impact of our efforts to continue to advance sustainable and socially conscious business operations, and to meet the expectations that our investors and other stakeholders have with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices; 
 the effects of climate change, natural disasters, and the impacts of public health issues, and the related changes in the regulatory environment and consumer demand to mitigate these effects, and the resulting impact on our business and the businesses of our customers, consumers, suppliers, and business partners; 
 expansion of our brands, product offerings, and investments in our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) capabilities, including our distribution facilities, e-commerce websites, and our retail store footprint; 
 global geopolitical tensions, including the impact of economic sanctions on our transportation and energy costs; 
 security breach or other disruption to our information technology (IT) systems, or those of our vendors; 
 our interpretation of applicable global tax regulations and changes in tax laws and audits that may impact our tax liability and effective tax rates; 
 our cash repatriation strategy regarding earnings of non-United States (US) subsidiaries and the resulting tax impacts; 
 the outcomes of legal proceedings, including the impact they may have on our business and intellectual property rights; and 
 the value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and potential write-downs or impairment charges. 
 
 Forward-looking statements represent management s current expectations and predictions about trends affecting our business and industry and are based on information available at the time such statements are made. Although we do not make forward-looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. Forward-looking statements involve numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements predicted, assumed, or implied by the forward-looking statements. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to materially differ from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements are described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, within this Quarterly Report, as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which are available free of charge on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov and our website at ir.deckers.com . You should read this Quarterly Report, including the information and documents incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from the results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Moreover, new risks and uncertainties emerge occasionally, and it is not possible for management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause our actual future results to be materially different from any results expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law or the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange, we expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We qualify all our forward-looking statements with these cautionary statements.

NOTE 1. 

proprietary brands include the UGG, HOKA, Teva, Koolaburra, and AHNU brands. Refer to the section titled Reportable Operating Segments, below within this Note 1, General, for more information on the sale of the Sanuk brand during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company sells its products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to its global consumers through its DTC business, which is comprised of its e-commerce business and retail stores. Independent third-party contractors manufacture all of the Company s products. 
 Seasonality . A significant part of the UGG brand s business has historically been seasonal, requiring the Company to build inventory levels during certain quarters in its fiscal year to support higher selling seasons, which has contributed to variation in its results from quarter to quarter. However, as the Company continues to take steps to diversify and expand its product offerings by creating more year-round styles, and as net sales of the HOKA brand, which generally occur more evenly throughout the year, continue to increase as a percentage of the Company s aggregate net sales, the Company expects to continue to see the impact from seasonality decrease over time. 
 
 -for-one forward stock split of its common stock and preferred stock (the stock split), and (ii) increased the number of authorized shares of its common stock from to , and the number of authorized shares of its capital stock from to (the authorized share increase). The stock split and the authorized share increase were effected through the filing of an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Charter Amendment) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which was approved by the Company s stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on September 9, 2024 (Annual Meeting). The Charter Amendment did not provide for any increase in the number of authorized shares of preferred stock, which remains at shares. There are shares of preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024. As a result of the stock split, every one share of common stock outstanding on September 6, 2024, the record date for the stock split, was automatically split into shares of common stock. The common stock commenced t rading on a post-stock split adjusted basis on September 17, 2024.

NOTE 4. 

Effective income tax rate 
 
 The tax provisions during the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were computed using the estimated effective income tax rate applicable to each of the domestic and foreign taxable jurisdictions for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, respectively, and were adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented above. During the current period, the net increase in the effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to the effects of discrete items, including a change in valuation allowance on tax attributes and a change in return-to-provision differences, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits for stock-based compensation. 
 
 Recent Tax Law Changes. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (commonly known as OECD) has released Pillar Two model rules introducing a 15 global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations to be effective starting with tax periods ending in 2024. Various jurisdictions the Company operates in have enacted or plan to enact legislation beginning in calendar year 2024 or in subsequent years. The enactment of Pillar Two legislation did not have a material effect on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income during the current period. The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future periods, as each of the respective jurisdictions enact the legislation and the legislation becomes effective.

of undiscounted minimum lease payments due pursuant to leases signed but not yet commenced during the six months ended September 30, 2024, and through October 11, 2024, primarily for a new HOKA brand retail store lease in Paris that the Company expects will be operational during the quarter ending December 31, 2024. 
 
 Purchase Obligations. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business during the six months ended September 30, 2024, to purchase obligations disclosed in the 2024 Annual Report. 
 
 Litigation. From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings, disputes, and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property, and product liability claims. Although the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes it is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, disputes, or other claims for which a material loss is considered probable and for which the amount (or range) of loss is reasonably estimable. However, regardless of the merit of the claims raised or the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management s time and resources, and other factors. 
 
 Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part IV of the 2024 Annual Report for further information on the Company s contractual obligations and commitments. 

NOTE 6. 

shares of the Company s common stock for issuance to employees, directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors. The 2015 SIP provided for the issuance of a variety of stock-based compensation awards, including time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs), long-term incentive plan PSUs (LTIP PSUs), stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, incentive stock options (ISOs), and non-qualified stock options (NQSOs). Refer to Note 8, Stock-Based Compensation, in the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part IV of the 2024 Annual Report for additional information about the terms of the 2015 SIP. 
 
 In September 2024, the Company s stockholders approved the 2024 Stock Incentive Plan (2024 SIP), which is intended to replace the 2015 SIP. Consistent with the 2015 SIP, the primary purpose of the 2024 SIP is to encourage ownership in the Company by key personnel, whose long-term service is considered essential to the Company s continued success. As a result of the stock split , the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2024 SIP and the number of shares underlying outstanding equity awards and the exercise price of stock options were adjusted proportionately. 
 
 The 2024 SIP initially reserves shares of the Company s common stock for issuance to employees, directors, consultants, and independent contractors, less share for every one share granted under the 2015 SIP after March 31, 2024 and prior to September 9, 2024, the effective date of the 2024 SIP, subject to an increase from the return of shares under the 2015 SIP as described below. The terms of the 2024 SIP are substantially similar to the terms of the 2015 SIP. The 2024 SIP provides for the issuance of a variety of stock-based compensation awards, including RSUs, PSUs, LTIP PSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, ISOs, and NQSOs. The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued to employees under the 2024 SIP through the exercise of ISOs is .

 Segment Net Sales and Income from Operations. The Company evaluates reportable operating segment performance primarily based on net sales and income (loss) from operations. The wholesale operations of each brand are managed separately because each requires different marketing, research and development, design, sourcing, and sales strategies. The income (loss) from operations of each of the reportable operating segments includes only those costs which are specifically related to each reportable operating segment, which consist primarily of cost of sales, research and development, design, sales and marketing, depreciation, amortization, and the direct costs of employees within those reportable operating segments. 
 
 The Company does not allocate corporate overhead costs or non-operating income and expenses to reportable operating segments, which include unallocable overhead costs associated with the Company s warehouses and DCs, certain executive and stock-based compensation, accounting, finance, legal, IT, human resources, and facilities, among others. Inter-segment sales from the Company s wholesale reportable operating segments to the DTC reportable operating segment are at the Company s cost, and there is no inter-segment profit on these inter-segment sales, nor are they reflected in income (loss) from operations of the wholesale reportable operating segments as these transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 

We disclose financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP; however, throughout this Quarterly Report we provide certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis (non-GAAP financial measures). We provide non-GAAP financial measures to provide information that may assist investors in understanding our results of operations and assessing our prospects for future performance, which consist of constant currency measures. We believe evaluating certain financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis is important as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not indicative of our core results of operations and are largely outside of our control. However, our non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be considered more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of financial or operating performance as determined in accordance with US GAAP. 
 
 We calculate our constant currency non-GAAP financial measures for current period financial information, such as total net sales using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period, excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate hedges and remeasurements in the condensed consolidated financial statements. We also report comparable DTC sales on a constant currency basis for DTC operations that were open throughout the current and prior reporting periods, and we may adjust prior reporting periods to conform to current year accounting policies. The information presented on a constant currency basis, as we present such information, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled information presented by other companies, and may not be appropriate measures for comparing our performance relative to other companies. Constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to US dollar measures that reflect current period foreign currency exchange rates or to other financial or operating measures presented in accordance with US GAAP. 
 
 SEASONALITY 

Refer to Note 1, General, of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report and to Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our 2024 Annual Report for detailed information on the seasonality of our business.

Refer to the section titled Reportable Operating Segments, in Note 1, General, of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 
 Total net sales increased primarily due to higher global net sales across all channels for the HOKA and UGG brands. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 20.4 , compared to the prior period. Further, we experienced an increase of 19.0 in the total volume of units sold to 21,300 from 17,900, compared to the prior period. Units sold represents all units related to the total net sales presented, inclusive of all categories such as footwear, apparel, accessories, home goods, and care kits. The prior period total volume of units sold for only footwear has been modified to conform to the current period presentation. 
 
 Drivers of significant changes in net sales, compared to the prior period, were as follows: 
 
 Wholesale net sales of the HOKA brand increased primarily due to higher global net sales across the brand s product assortment, driven by market share gains and benefits from select new points of distribution with key partners globally, as well as the timing of certain distributor shipments. 
 
 DTC net sales increased primarily due to higher global sales for the HOKA and UGG brands, driven primarily by consumer acquisition and retention online as we continued to experience increased demand for both brands, especially among international regions. Comparable DTC channel net sales for the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2024, increased by 17.0 , compared to the prior period. 
 
 Wholesale net sales of the UGG brand increased primarily due to higher global net sales as a result of increased demand for year-round key product franchises, also benefiting from timing of sell-in for fall and winter franchises. 
 
 International net sales, which are included in the reportable operating segment net sales presented above, increased by 33.0 and represented 34.9 and 31.5 of total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by higher global net sales across all channels for the HOKA and UGG brands. 
 
 Gross Profit. Gross margin increased to 55.9 from 53.4 , compared to the prior period, primarily due to favorable brand and product mix for the HOKA brand along with higher margin product driving a higher proportion of growth for both the HOKA and UGG brands, and reduced closeouts to the wholesale channel. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable freight costs due to rising ocean freight costs, and slightly unfavorable channel mix shifts.

Table of Contents 

 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. The net increase in SG A expenses, compared to the prior period, was primarily the result of the following: 
 
 Increased variable advertising and promotion expenses of approximately 32,000, primarily due to higher promotional marketing expenses for the HOKA and UGG brands to drive global brand awareness and market share gains, highlight new product categories, and provide localized marketing. 
 
 Increased other operating expenses of approximately 25,600, primarily due to higher contract expenses, legal expenses, and infrastructure investments and related depreciation. 
 
 Increased payroll and related costs of approximately 20,300, primarily due to investments in talent for key functions for corporate and HOKA brand roles driving higher employee headcount and full-year costs for prior comparable period hiring. 
 
 Increased other variable net selling expenses of approximately 11,300, primarily due to higher warehouse expenses, sales commissions and related fees, and credit card fees, as well as higher rent and occupancy costs related to HOKA brand growth. 
 
 Increased net foreign currency-related gains of approximately 19,500, primarily driven by favorable changes in Asian and European exchange rates against the US dollar.

 The increase in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, combined with slightly lower SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales.

 The increase in income from operations of HOKA brand wholesale was due to higher global net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 The increase in income from operations of the DTC channel was due to higher global net sales for the HOKA and UGG brands at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales.

 The increase in income from operations of UGG brand wholesale was due to higher global net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 Unallocated overhead costs were a lower percentage of net sales, but increased primarily due to higher other operating expenses and payroll costs for key corporate roles to support growth of our brands, partially offset by increased foreign currency-related gains. 
 
 Total Other Income, Net. The increase in total other income, net, compared to the prior period, was due to higher interest income from higher invested cash balances. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense and our effective income tax rate were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Income tax expense 76,591 55,770 Effective income tax rate 24.0 23.8 
 
 The net increase in our effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to the effects of discrete items, including a change in valuation allowance on tax attributes and a change in return-to-provision differences, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits for stock-based compensation. 
 
 Net Income. The increase in net income, compared to the prior period, was due to higher net sales and operating margins, as well as higher interest income. Net income per share increased, compared to the prior period, due to higher net income and lower weighted-average common shares outstanding driven by stock repurchases. 
 
 Total Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax. The increase in total other comprehensive income, net of tax, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher foreign currency translation gains relating to changes in the net asset position against Asian and European foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher unrealized losses on cash flow hedges.

 Total net sales increased primarily due to higher global net sales across all channels for the HOKA and UGG brands. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 21.4 , compared to the prior period. Further, we experienced an increase of 16.8 in the total volume of units sold to 34,000 from 29,100, compared to the prior period. Units sold represents all units related to the total net sales presented, inclusive of all categories such as footwear, apparel, accessories, home goods, and care kits. The prior period total volume of units sold for only footwear has been modified to conform to the current period presentation. 
 
 Drivers of significant changes in net sales, compared to the prior period, were as follows: 
 
 Wholesale net sales of the HOKA brand increased primarily due to higher global sales across the brand s product assortment, driven by market share gains, refilling channel inventory, and benefits from select new points of distribution with key partners, as well as the timing of certain distributor shipments.

Table of Contents 

 DTC net sales increased primarily due to higher global sales for the HOKA and UGG brands, driven primarily by consumer acquisition and retention online as we continued to experience increased demand for both brands, as well as a slight benefit from higher levels of full-price selling. Comparable DTC channel net sales for the 26 weeks ended September 29, 2024, increased by 19.3 , compared to the prior period. 
 
 Wholesale net sales of the UGG brand increased primarily due to higher global sales as a result of increased demand for year-round key product franchises, also benefiting from timing of sell-in for fall and winter franchises. 
 
 International net sales, which are included in the reportable operating segment net sales presented above, increased by 27.8 and represented 35.9 and 33.9 of total net sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by higher global net sales for both channels for the HOKA and UGG brands. 
 
 Gross Profit. Gross margin increased to 56.3 from 52.6 , compared to the prior period, primarily due to favorable brand and product mix for the HOKA brand along with higher margin product driving a higher proportion of growth for both the HOKA and UGG brands and higher full-price selling, including reduced closeouts to the wholesale channel. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. The net increase in SG A expenses, compared to the prior period, was primarily the result of the following: 
 
 Increased variable advertising and promotion expenses of approximately 47,800, primarily due to higher promotional marketing expenses for the HOKA and UGG brands to drive global brand awareness and market share gains, highlight new product categories, and provide localized marketing. 
 
 Increased payroll and related costs of approximately 45,200, primarily due to investments in talent for key functions for corporate and HOKA brand roles driving higher employee headcount and full-year costs for prior comparable period hiring. 
 
 Increased other operating expenses of approximately 33,200, primarily due to higher infrastructure investments and related depreciation, contract expenses, and travel expenses. 
 
 Increased other variable net selling expenses of approximately 20,100, primarily due to higher rent and occupancy costs related to HOKA brand growth, higher warehouse expenses and credit card fees, as well as higher selling expenses, including sales commissions and related fees, and materials and supplies. 
 
 Increased net foreign currency-related gains of approximately 15,100, primarily driven by favorable changes in Asian and European exchange rates against the US dollar. 
 
 Income from Operations. Income (loss) from operations by reportable operating segment was as follows:

Refer to the section titled Reportable Operating Segments, in Note 1, General, of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 
 The increase in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, combined with slightly lower SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 Drivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, were as follows: 
 
 The increase in income from operations of the DTC channel was due to higher global net sales for the HOKA and UGG brands at higher gross margins, partially offset by a slightly higher rate of SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 The increase in income from operations of HOKA brand wholesale was due to higher global net sales at higher gross margins, combined with relatively flat SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 The increase in income from operations of UGG brand wholesale was primarily due to higher global net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales. 
 
 Unallocated overhead costs were lower as a percentage of net sales, but increased primarily due to higher payroll costs for key corporate roles to support growth of our brands, and higher other operating expenses, partially offset by increased foreign currency-related gains. 
 
 Total Other Income, Net. The increase in total other income, net, compared to the prior period, was due to higher interest income from higher invested cash balances and average interest rates. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense and our effective income tax rate were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Income tax expense 110,119 73,582 Effective income tax rate 23.5 23.3 
 
 The net increase in our effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to the effects of discrete items, including a change in valuation allowance on tax attributes and a change in return-to-provision differences, partially offset by net discrete tax benefits for stock-based compensation. 
 
 Net Income. The increase in net income, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales and operating margins, as well as higher interest income. Net income per share increased, compared to the prior period, due to higher net income and lower weighted-average common shares outstanding driven by stock repurchases. 
 
 Total Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax. The increase in total other comprehensive income, net of tax, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher foreign currency translation gains relating to changes in the net asset position against Asian and European foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher unrealized losses on cash flow hedges.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our liquidity may be impacted by a number of factors, risks and uncertainties described in the section titled Liquidity in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2024 Annual Report. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity. We finance our working capital and operating requirements using a combination of cash and cash equivalents balances, including cash from our repatriation strategy, cash provided from ongoing operating activities and, to a lesser extent, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. Refer to the Cash Flows section below for further discussion on cash flows from ongoing operating activities. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents are 1,225,681, the majority of which is held in highly rated money market funds and interest-bearing bank deposit accounts with established national and global financial institutions. We believe our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash provided by operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months and will be sufficient to meet the long-term requirements of our business strategies and plans. However, there can be no assurance that sufficient capital will continue to be available or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 Repatriation of Cash . Our cash repatriation strategy, and by extension, our liquidity, may be impacted by several additional considerations, which include future changes to or interpretations of global tax laws and regulations, and our actual earnings in future periods. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 , no cash and cash equivalents were repatriated. As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, we have 273,887 and 263,820, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries, a portion of which may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes if it were to be repatriated. We continue to evaluate our cash repatriation strategy and currently anticipate repatriating current and future unremitted earnings of non- US subsidiaries to the extent they have been subject to US income tax if such cash is not required to fund ongoing foreign operations. Refer to Note 5, Income Taxes, of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our 2024 Annual Report for further information regarding our cash repatriation strategy. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facilities. Information about the revolving credit facilities available as of September 30, 2024, is as follows: 
 
 Primary Credit Facility. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we made no borrowings or repayments and there were no material changes to the terms, to the outstanding letters of credit, or to the borrowing availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report. 
 
 China Credit Facilit y. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, we made no borrowings or repayments and there were no material changes to the terms or to the outstanding bank guarantees under our credit facility in China disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report. 
 
 Debt Covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we are in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Refer to Note 6, Revolving Credit Facilities, of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV of our 2024 Annual Report for further information on the terms of our revolving credit facilities. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include uses for working capital, and payments to fulfill contractual obligations, capital expenditures, and stock repurchases. Our working capital requirements begin when we purchase raw and other materials and inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting trade accounts receivable. Given the historical seasonality of our business, our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout our fiscal year, and we utilize available cash to build inventory levels during certain quarters in our fiscal year to support higher selling seasons. While the impact of seasonality has been mitigated to some extent, we expect our working capital requirements will continue to fluctuate from period to period.

 Stock Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate remaining approved amount under our stock repurchase program is 685,413. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at our discretion.

CASH FLOWS 

The following table summarizes the major components of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Amount Amount Amount Net cash provided by operating activities 22,100 121,528 (99,428) (81.8) Net cash used in investing activities (34,442) (57,402) 22,960 40.0 Net cash used in financing activities (267,014) (217,149) (49,865) (23.0) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 2,986 (5,721) 8,707 152.2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (276,370) (158,744) (117,626) (74.1) 
 
 Operating Activities. Our primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities, which is driven by our net income after non-cash adjustments and changes in working capital. 
 
 The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period, was due to 233,409 of unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by 133,981 of favorable net income after non-cash adjustments. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to (1) higher purchases of inventory to support higher demand for our brands, (2) lower net trade accounts payable related to timing of receipts of goods and services and respective disbursements, (3) higher trade accounts receivable on higher net sales, (4) lower accrued expenses primarily for the payment of performance-based compensation; and (5) favorable changes due to timing of derivative cash settlements. 
 
 Investing Activities. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to lower capital expenditures for leasehold improvements for our warehouses and DCs, and by an increase from cash proceeds from the sale of certain assets. 
 
 Financing Activities. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to a higher dollar value of stock repurchases.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative accounting pronouncements, and other factors that we believe to be reasonable, but actual results could differ materially from these estimates. In addition, management has considered the potential impact of macroeconomic factors, including inflation, foreign currency exchange rate volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in commodity pricing, changes in consumer discretionary spending, and recessionary concerns, on our business and operations. Although the full impact of these factors is unknown, management believes it has made appropriate accounting estimates and assumptions based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. However, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions, which may result in material effects on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Refer to the sections titled Use of Estimates and Recent Accounting Pronouncements within Note 1, General, of our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report, for additional information regarding applicable key estimates and assumptions, as well as the impact of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and key estimates and assumptions disclosed in the section titled Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, within our 2024 Annual Report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 In the normal course of business, our financial position and results of operations are subject to a variety of risks, including risks associated with commodity pricing, foreign currency exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, interest rates. We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices designed to mitigate their effects. There have been no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, within our 2024 Annual Report.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours is designed to do, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our PEO and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer (PFAO) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER CERTIFICATIONS 

The certifications of our PEO and PFAO required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Exchange Act are filed as Exhibit 31.1 and Exhibit 31.2, and furnished as Exhibit 32, to this Quarterly Report. This Part I, Item 4, should be read in conjunction with such certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 As part of our global policing program to protect our intellectual property rights, from time to time, we file lawsuits in various jurisdictions asserting claims for alleged acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, patent infringement, trade dress infringement, and trademark dilution. We generally have multiple actions such as these pending at any given point in time. These actions may result in seizure of counterfeit merchandise, out-of-court settlements with defendants, or other outcomes. In addition, from time to time, we are subject to claims in which opposing parties will raise, either as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims, the invalidity or unenforceability of certain of our intellectual property rights, including allegations that the UGG brand trademark registrations and design patents are invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, we are aware of many instances throughout the world in which a third-party is using our UGG brand and HOKA brand trademarks within its internet domain name. We are investigating several manufacturers and distributors of counterfeit UGG and HOKA brand products, as well as various markets for indications of counterfeit UGG and HOKA brand products. 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, disputes, and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property, and product liability claims. Although the results of these ordinary course matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, regardless of the merit of the claims raised or the outcome, these ordinary course matters can have an adverse impact on us as a result of legal costs, diversion of management s time and resources, and other factors. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 An investment in our common stock involves risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all the information within Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in Part I, Item 1 within this Quarterly Report. In addition, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2024 Annual Report, as well as in our other public filings with the SEC. If any of the identified risks are realized, our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In addition, other risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we do not currently view to be material, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and prospects. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2024 Annual Report.

not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 7.2 or otherwise. 
 SECTION 7.3 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit . If a claim under Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct for indemnification set forth in Section 145(a) or (b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law to the fullest extent permitted by law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnitee is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any proceeding (or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein), indemnitee shall be indemnified for his or her expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred in such defense, and the Corporation may not assert the failure to satisfy a standard of conduct as a basis to deny indemnification, or as a basis to recover amounts advanced, in connection with such defense. 
 
 SECTION 7.4 Indemnification of Employees and Agents . The Corporation may, but only to the extent that the Board may (but shall not be obligated to) authorize from time to time, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII as they apply to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

The Corporation may enter into indemnification agreements with any one or more directors, officers, employees and agents upon resolution duly adopted by the Board. Such agreements may indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware law, the Certificate of Incorporation and this Article VII. 
 14 

SECTION 7.6 Nature of Rights . The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article VII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee s heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.
