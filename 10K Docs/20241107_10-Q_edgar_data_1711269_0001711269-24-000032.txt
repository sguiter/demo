 CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 Statements made in this document that are not based on historical facts are forward-looking, may involve risks and uncertainties, and are intended to be as of the date when made. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to Evergy's strategic plan, including, without limitation, those related to earnings per share, dividend, operating and maintenance expense and capital investment goals; the outcome of legislative efforts and regulatory and legal proceedings; future energy demand, including demand driven by new and existing customers; future power prices; plans with respect to existing and potential future generation resources; the availability and cost of generation resources and energy storage; target emissions reductions; and other matters relating to expected financial performance or affecting future operations. Forward-looking statements are often accompanied by forward-looking words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "estimates," "forecasts," "guidance," "should," "could," "may," "seeks," "intends," "predict," "potential," "opportunities," "proposed," "projects," "planned," "target," "outlook," "remain confident," "goal," "will" or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. 
 In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Evergy Companies are providing a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking information. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to: economic and weather conditions and any impact on sales, prices and costs; significant changes in the demand for electricity; changes in business strategy or operations, including with respect to the Evergy Companies' strategy to meet demand requirements of existing and future customers; the impact of federal, state and local political, legislative, judicial and regulatory actions or developments, including deregulation, re-regulation, securitization and restructuring of the electric utility industry; the ability to build or acquire generation and transmission facilities to meet the future demand for electricity from customers; the ability to control costs, avoid costs and schedule overruns during the development, construction and operation of generation, transmission, distribution or other projects due to challenges, which include, but are not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability and productivity, challenges with the management of contractors or vendors, subcontractor performance, shortages, delays, increased costs or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials and labor and increased financing costs as a result of changes in interest rates or as a result of project delays; decisions of regulators regarding, among other things, customer rates and the prudency of operational decisions such as capital expenditures and asset retirements; changes in applicable laws, regulations, rules, principles or practices, or the interpretations thereof, governing tax, accounting and environmental matters, including air and water quality and waste management and disposal; the impact of climate change, including increased frequency and severity of significant weather events; risks relating to potential wildfires, including costs of litigation, potential regulatory penalties and damages in excess of insurance liability coverage; the extent to which counterparties are willing to do business with, finance the operations of or purchase energy from the Evergy Companies due to the fact that the Evergy Companies operate coal-fired generation; prices and availability of electricity and natural gas in wholesale markets; market perception of the energy industry and the Evergy Companies; the impact of future pandemic health events on, among other things, sales, results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows, and also on operational issues, such as supply chain issues and the availability and ability of the Evergy Companies' employees and suppliers to perform the functions that are necessary to operate the Evergy Companies; changes in the energy trading markets in which the Evergy Companies participate, including retroactive repricing of transactions by regional transmission organizations (RTO) and independent system operators; financial market conditions and performance, disruptions in the banking industry, including volatility in interest rates and credit spreads and in availability and cost of capital and the effects on derivatives and hedges, nuclear decommissioning trust and pension plan assets and costs; impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill; credit ratings; inflation rates; effectiveness of risk management policies and procedures and the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual commitments; impact of physical and cybersecurity breaches, criminal activity, terrorist attacks, acts of war and other disruptions to the Evergy Companies' facilities or information technology infrastructure or the facilities and infrastructure of third-party service providers on which the Evergy Companies rely; impact of geopolitical conflicts on the global energy market, including the ability to contract for non-Russian sourced uranium; ability to carry out marketing and sales plans; cost, availability, quality and timely provision of equipment, supplies, labor and fuel; impacts of tariffs; ability to achieve generation goals and the occurrence and duration of planned and unplanned generation outages;

Table of Contents 

 the Evergy Companies' ability to manage their generation, transmission and distribution development plans and transmission joint ventures; the inherent risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear facility, including environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks; workforce risks, including those related to the Evergy Companies' ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, maintain satisfactory relationships with their labor unions and manage costs of, or changes in, wages, retirement, health care and other benefits; disruption, costs and uncertainties caused by or related to the actions of individuals or entities, such as activist shareholders or special interest groups, that seek to influence Evergy's strategic plan, financial results or operations; the impact of changing expectations and demands of the Evergy Companies' customers, regulators, investors and stakeholders, including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns; the possibility that strategic initiatives, including mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, and long-term financial plans, may not create the value that they are expected to achieve in a timely manner or at all; difficulties in maintaining relationships with customers, employees, contractors, regulators or suppliers; and other risks and uncertainties. 
 This list of factors is not all-inclusive because it is not possible to predict all factors. You should also carefully consider the information contained in the Evergy Companies' other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additional risks and uncertainties are discussed from time to time in current, quarterly and annual reports filed by the Evergy Companies with the SEC. New factors emerge from time to time, and it's not possible for the Evergy Companies to predict all such factors, nor can the Evergy Companies assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement. Given these uncertainties, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements. The Evergy Companies undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 See "Evergy Kansas Central TFR Formal Challenge" within this Note 4 for additional information regarding the March 2023 adjustment. 
 Evergy Kansas Central TFR Formal Challenge 
 In March 2022, certain Evergy Kansas Central TFR customers submitted a formal challenge regarding the implementation of Evergy Kansas Central's TFR, specifically how Evergy Kansas Central's capital structure was calculated as part of determining the Annual Transmission Revenue Requirement. As part of this challenge, the customers requested that Evergy Kansas Central make refunds for over-collections in rate years 2018 through 2022 as a result of the calculation of its capital structure included in the TFR. Evergy Kansas Central disputed that any refunds for 2018 through 2022 were required because Evergy Kansas Central was following its approved TFR formula. 
 In December 2022, FERC issued an order addressing the challenge to the 2020 through 2022 over-collections which were refunded to customers as part of Evergy Kansas Central's 2023 TFR effective in March 2023. In February 2023, certain Evergy Kansas Central TFR customers submitted a formal complaint with FERC requesting the refund of over-collections related to the 2018 and 2019 rate years. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central had recorded a million regulatory liability related to the 2018 and 2019 rate year refund request. Evergy is awaiting a response from FERC. 
 Evergy Metro TFR Annual Update

 million increase effective in January 2025; 
 million increase effective in January 2024; and

 million of goodwill that was recorded as a result of the Great Plains Energy, Inc. (Great Plains Energy) and Evergy Kansas Central merger was conducted as of May 1, 2024. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. Evergy's consolidated operations are considered reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. The determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2024 or 2023.

 ownership share of Wolf Creek defined benefit plans, consisting of Evergy Kansas South's and Evergy Metro's respective ownership shares. 
 For the majority of employees, pension benefits under these plans reflect the employees' compensation, years of service and age at retirement. However, for the plan covering Evergy Kansas Central's employees, the benefits for non-union employees hired between 2002 and the second quarter of 2018 and union employees hired beginning in 2012 are derived from a cash balance account formula. The plan was closed to future non-union employees in 2018. For the plans covering Evergy Metro's employees, the benefits for union employees hired beginning in 2014 are derived from a cash balance account formula and the plans were closed to future non-union employees in 2014. 
 Evergy and its subsidiaries also provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro and their respective shares of Wolf Creek's post-retirement benefit plans. 
 The Evergy Companies record pension and post-retirement expense in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC that allow the difference between pension and post-retirement costs under GAAP and costs for ratemaking to be recognized as a regulatory asset or liability. This difference between financial and regulatory accounting methods is due to timing and will be eliminated over the life of the plans. 
 For the three months ended and year to date September 30, 2024, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement gains or losses. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement (gains) losses of million, million and million, respectively. Year to date September 30, 2023, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement (gains) losses of million, million and million, respectively.

 EVERGY, INC. 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Evergy is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below. 
 Evergy Kansas Central is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas. Evergy Kansas Central has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South. 
 Evergy Metro is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. 
 Evergy Missouri West is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri. 
 Evergy Transmission Company owns 13.5 of Transource with the remaining 86.5 owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of AEP. Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects. Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method. 
 Evergy Kansas Central also owns a 50 interest in Prairie Wind, which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kV double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the SPP. Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method. 
 Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy. Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately 15,800 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 1.7 million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri. The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment). 
 Evergy Missouri West 2024 Rate Case Proceeding 
 In February 2024, Evergy Missouri West filed an application with the MPSC to request an increase to its retail revenues of approximately 104 million. Evergy Missouri West's request reflected a return on equity of 10.5 (with a capital structure composed of 52 equity) and increases related to the recovery of infrastructure investments made to improve reliability and enhance customer service and the inclusion of certain costs related to Dogwood and Crossroads, two natural gas plants. 
 In October 2024, Evergy Missouri West, MPSC staff and other intervenors in the case reached a unanimous partial stipulation and agreement to settle certain issues in the case. The partial stipulation and agreement provided for an increase to Evergy Missouri West's retail revenues of approximately 55 million after lowering base rates for fuel and purchased power expense of approximately 49 million and rebasing property tax expense. The partial stipulation and agreement excludes one prospective issue related to the proportion of fuel and purchased power costs that are shared with shareholders in Evergy Missouri West's fuel adjustment clause which will be resolved by the MPSC in its final order. The unanimous partial stipulation and agreement is subject to the approval of the MPSC expected in December 2024. If approved, new rates are expected to be effective in January 2025.

 Kansas Legislation 
 In April 2024, Kansas H.B. 2527 was signed into law by the Governor of Kansas. Most notably, H.B. 2527 includes a plant-in service accounting (PISA) provision that can be elected by Kansas electric public utilities to defer and recover as regulatory assets 90 of depreciation expense and associated return on investment linked to qualifying electric plants in service. Qualifying electric plant includes all rate base additions by an electric public utility, but does not include transmission facilities or new electric generating units. The deferred depreciation and return on the associated regulatory asset are required to be included in determining the utility's rate base during subsequent general rate proceedings. The return on the deferred regulatory asset balances will be calculated using the weighted average cost of capital. Utilities that elect the PISA provision can make qualifying deferrals of depreciation and return from July 2024 through December 2030. Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro elected the PISA provision in their Kansas jurisdictions effective in July 2024. 
 Additionally, the law establishes new mechanisms for the recovery of costs associated with new gas-fired generating units. If the KCC decides investment in a new gas-fired generating unit is reasonable, the utility would be able to recover the return on 100 of the associated construction costs at its weighted average cost of capital. The cost recovery from customers could begin a year after construction begins. Rates could be adjusted every six months until new base rates reflecting the plant's costs are established. 
 In April 2024, Kansas S.B. 410 was signed into law by the Governor of Kansas. Most notably, S.B. 410 includes an exemption from all property and ad valorem taxes on certain electric generation facilities for which construction or installation begins on or after January 1, 2025. 
 Renewable Plant Investments 
 Evergy Kansas Central intends to construct and own an approximately 159 MW solar generation facility to be located in Kansas and called Kansas Sky. The solar generation facility is expected to begin operations by summer of 2027. The construction of Kansas Sky is subject to the granting by the KCC of predetermination with reasonably acceptable terms and other closing conditions. In November 2024, Evergy Kansas Central requested predetermination from the KCC. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, Evergy Missouri West entered into agreements to own two solar generation facilities currently under development. The first facility, to be called Sunflower Sky, is a solar generation facility to be located in Kansas with an expected generating capacity of approximately 65 MW. The second facility, to be called Foxtrot, is a solar generation facility to be located in Missouri with an expected generating capacity of approximately 100 MW. The solar generation facilities are expected to begin operations by summer of 2027. The agreements are subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the granting by the MPSC of a CCN with reasonably acceptable terms. In October 2024, Evergy Missouri West filed an application for a CCN. Evergy Missouri West requested a response from the MPSC by May 2025. 
 Natural Gas Plant Investments 
 In October 2024, Evergy announced its plan to construct two combined-cycle natural gas plants located in Kansas. Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Missouri West will jointly-own the first site and expect it to have an initial generating capacity of approximately 705 MW. The plant is expected to begin operations by summer of 2029. In November 2024, Evergy Kansas Central requested predetermination from the KCC. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Evergy Missouri West plans to request a CCN from the MPSC. 
 The second site is expected to be jointly-owned by Evergy Kansas Central and another Evergy utility still to be determined. The Evergy Companies expect the second site to also have an initial generating capacity of approximately 705 MW. The plant is expected to begin operations by summer of 2030. In November 2024, Evergy Kansas Central requested predetermination from the KCC with a request to potentially reassign a portion to another Evergy utility. A request for a CCN with the MPSC is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In April 2024, Evergy Missouri West purchased a 22 ownership interest representing approximately 145 MW in Dogwood, an operational combined-cycle natural gas facility located in Missouri, for approximately 60 million. The purchase was recorded as an asset acquisition to property, plant and equipment, net, on Evergy's consolidated

Table of Contents 

 balance sheet. The purchase was subject to terms and conditions listed in a stipulation and agreement approved by the MPSC allowing Evergy Missouri West to recover in rates a return of and return on the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood. Evergy Missouri West shall also be allowed to recover in rates over two years a return of, but not a return on, the amount of the purchase price paid in excess of the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood. In addition, net revenues generated from Evergy Missouri West's ownership of Dogwood from the date of closing to the date new rates become effective in Evergy Missouri West's current rate case shall not impact rates and shall be retained by Evergy Missouri West and reduce the amount of the purchase price paid in excess of the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood to be recovered from customers. 
 Regulatory Proceedings 
 See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding other regulatory proceedings. 
 Wolf Creek Refueling Outage and Fuel Supply 
 Wolf Creek's most recent refueling outage began in March 2024 and the unit returned to service in May 2024. Wolf Creek's next refueling outage is planned to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
 In May 2024, President Biden signed into law the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act, which limits the importation of uranium from the Russian Federation. The Evergy Companies have a Russian-sourced contract beginning in 2025 to obtain nuclear fuel and have taken mitigating measures to minimize the impact of the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act to their supply chain. The Evergy Companies do not expect a material impact to their supply chain or financial results. 
 Earnings Overview 
 The following table summarizes Evergy's net income and diluted EPS. 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Year to Date September 30 2024 Change 2023 2024 Change 2023 (millions, except per share amounts) Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. 465.6 114.0 351.6 795.3 122.0 673.3 Earnings per common share, diluted 2.02 0.49 1.53 3.45 0.53 2.92 
 
 Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the recognition of a 96.5 million regulatory liability in the third quarter of 2023 for future refund of amounts of revenues previously collected from customers related to COLI rate credits, new Evergy Kansas Central retail rates effective in December 2023, higher transmission revenues and lower mark-to-market losses related to forward contracts for natural gas and electricity in the third quarter of 2023; partially offset by higher taxes other than income tax, income tax and depreciation expense and recording lower Evergy Kansas Central corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) benefits in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Diluted EPS increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. discussed above. 
 Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. increased year to date September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to new Evergy Kansas Central retail rates effective in December 2023, the recognition of a 96.5 million regulatory liability in the third quarter of 2023 for future refund of amounts of revenues previously collected from customers related to COLI rate credits, higher transmission revenues and lower pension non-service costs; partially offset by higher taxes other than income tax, depreciation, interest, operating and maintenance expense and lower investment earnings in 2024. 
 Diluted EPS increased year to date September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the increase in net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. discussed above.

 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Evergy Utility Gross Margin (non-GAAP) 
 Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Utility gross margin (non-GAAP), as used by the Evergy Companies, is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs. Expenses for fuel and purchased power costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms. As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income. In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by SPP members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO. As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income. The Evergy Companies' definition of utility gross margin (non-GAAP) may differ from similar terms used by other companies. 
 Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) is intended to aid an investor's overall understanding of results. Management believes that utility gross margin (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the Evergy Companies' operations across periods because utility gross margin (non-GAAP) excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs and SPP network transmission costs. Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board. Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, gross margin, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Gross margin under GAAP is defined as the excess of sales over cost of goods sold. 
 Utility gross margin (non-GAAP) differs from the GAAP definition of gross margin due to the exclusion of operating and maintenance expenses determined to be directly attributable to revenue-producing activities, depreciation and amortization and taxes other than income tax. See the Evergy Companies' Results of Operations for a reconciliation of utility gross margin (non-GAAP) to gross margin, the most comparable GAAP measure. 
 Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) 
 Management believes that adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are representative measures of Evergy's recurring earnings, assists in the comparability of results and is consistent with how management reviews performance. 
 Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) for the three months ended and year to date September 30, 2024 were 465.6 million or 2.02 per share and 797.3 million or 3.46 per share, respectively. For the three months ended and year to date September 30, 2023, Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) were 432.3 million or 1.88 per share and 754.5 million or 3.27 per share, respectively. 
 In addition to net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and diluted EPS, Evergy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and EPS without: 
 i. the mark-to-market impacts of economic hedges related to Evergy Kansas Central's 8 ownership share of JEC; 
 ii. the costs resulting from non-regulated energy marketing margins from the February 2021 winter weather event; 
 iii. the second quarter 2023 recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund to customers of revenues previously collected since October 2019 for costs related to an electric subdivision rebate program to be refunded to customers in accordance with a June 2020 KCC order; and 
 iv. the recognition of a regulatory liability for future refund of amounts of revenues previously collected from customers related to COLI rate credits in accordance with a September 2023 KCC rate case unanimous settlement agreement.

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are intended to aid an investor's overall understanding of results. Management believes that adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) provides a meaningful basis for evaluating Evergy's operations across periods because it excludes certain items that management does not believe are indicative of Evergy's ongoing perf ormance or that can create period to period earnings volatility. 
 Ad justed earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Evergy relies primarily upon cash from operations, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements. Evergy's capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures, payment of contractual obligations and other commitments, and the payment of dividends to shareholders. See the Evergy Companies' combined 2023 Form 10-K for more information on Evergy's sources and uses of cash. 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 As of September 30, 2024, Evergy had 1,074.5 million of available borrowing capacity under its master credit facility. The available borrowing capacity under the master credit facility consisted of 216.1 million for Evergy, Inc., 257.3 million for Evergy Kansas Central, 377.1 million for Evergy Metro and 224.0 million for Evergy Missouri West. The Evergy Companies' borrowing capacity under the master credit facility also supports their issuance of commercial paper. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the master credit facility. 
 Along with cash flows from operations and receivable sales facilities, Evergy generally uses borrowings under its master credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements. Evergy may also utilize these short-term borrowings to repay maturing long-term debt until the long-term debt is able to be refinanced. Evergy believes that its existing cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its master credit facility provide sufficient liquidity for its existing capital requirements.
