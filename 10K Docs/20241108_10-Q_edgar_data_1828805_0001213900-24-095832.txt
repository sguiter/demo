 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and has accumulated deficit of at September
30, 2024. In addition, the Company is in the research and development stage and has generated limited revenue to date. In order to support
its operations, the Company will require additional infusions of cash from the sale of equity instruments or the issuance of debt instruments,
or the commencement of profitable revenue generating activities. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable
terms, the Company s ability to fund its operations, develop or enhance its sensors in the future or respond to competitive pressures
would be significantly limited. Such limitations could require the Company to curtail, suspend or discontinue parts of its business plan. 

These
conditions raise doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of the
Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

receive a cash payment equal to the aggregate amount of principal then outstanding under such Holder s Note or convert the Note
into shares of Common Stock equal to of the VWAP of the Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five trading days immediately prior
to the Sale of the Company. Although the conversion price is dependent upon the type of Conversion Event that occurs, the Note does carry
a ceiling and floor price: the applicable conversion price will not be lower than of the 5-day VWAP on the applicable Closing Date

closings. The Investors were granted piggyback registration rights for the shares of Common Stock underlying the Note. 

The
Note Purchase Agreement also contains customary representation and warranties of the Company and the Investors, indemnification obligations
of the Company, termination provisions, and other obligations and rights of the parties. 

The
Company analyzed the embedded features of the convertible notes and the debt discount is being amortized over the term of the convertible

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Unless
otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, references to Aeluma, the Company, we, 
 our, us, or similar terms refer to Aeluma, Inc. and Subsidiary. 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated
financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in this report. Some of the information contained
in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for
our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the disclosure under the heading
 Risk Factors in other filings we make with the SEC for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion
and analysis. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results. 

Overview 

We
develop novel optoelectronic devices for sensing and communications applications. Aeluma has pioneered a technique to manufacture devices
using high performance compound semiconductor materials on large-diameter substrates that are commonly used to manufacture mass market
microelectronics. This enables cost-effective manufacturing of high-performance photodetectors and photodetector array circuits for imaging
applications in mobile devices, as well as other technologies. This technology has the potential to enhance the performance and capability
of camera image sensors, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), facial recognition, and other
applications. 

Because
we will leverage compound semiconductor materials, our devices may operate at longer wavelengths than traditional silicon-based image
sensors, up to at least 1600 nm, which is advantageous for a number of reasons including eye safety. Beyond 1400 nm is considered eye
safe at significantly higher optical power levels relative to that at shorter wavelengths. Therefore, for LiDAR sensing systems, the
range (the detectable object distance) can be increased significantly. Operating at specific longer wavelengths (for example, near 1550
nm) also enables imaging both in low light (dark) conditions, as well as in direct sunlight. Therefore, images could be captured outdoors
and in various conditions. 

Additionally,
Aeluma s technology may be used to manufacture other electronic and optoelectronic devices in the future including lasers, transistors,
and solar cells. 

Aeluma
has acquired key manufacturing equipment, and has headquarters in Goleta, California with a manufacturing cleanroom to house this equipment. 

Recent
Government Contract 

On
September 6, 2024, the Company won 11.717 million DARPA contract for nano-scale semiconductors to develop heterogeneous integration
technology compatible with leading edge and future advanced-node semiconductors. Technology applications include AI, mobile devices and
5G/6G. This DARPA contract to Aeluma is structured with 5.974 million provided over 18 months, and the 5.743 million balance
provided over the following 18 months as Aeluma meets certain milestones. Teledyne Scientific Company, the Central Research Laboratory
of Teledyne, is a proposed subcontractor to assist with defining target materials and with developing strategies for demonstrating
program metrics. The University of California Santa Barbara is also a proposed subcontractor to support the implementation of test devices.

Private
Placements 

Between
August 5, 2024 and August 27, 2024, we issued convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of 3,145,000 to 10
accredited investors, pursuant to a private note financing. The Notes mature in June 2026 and do not carry any interest. The Notes
are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock upon
the occurrence of certain events, (i.e., qualified financing resulting in at least 5,000,000 to the Company, if the Common Stock is
uplisted to a national securities exchange or if neither of those such events occur prior to the maturity date, (together with Sale
of the Company (as hereinafter defined), a Conversion Event )). In the event the Company does not complete qualified
financing or uplist at or before the maturity date, the outstanding balance of the Notes shall automatically convert without any
further action by the Holder into shares of the Company s common stock equal to eighty-five percent (85 to the VWAP of the
Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five trading days immediately prior to maturity date. The Note also provides that if there
is a Sale of the Company, as defined in the Note, the Holder may elect to receive a cash payment equal to the aggregate amount of
principal then outstanding under such Holder s Note or convert the Note into shares of Common Stock equal to 85 of the VWAP
of the Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five trading days immediately prior to the Sale of the Company. Although the
conversion price is dependent upon the type of Conversion Event that occurs, the Note does carry a ceiling and floor price: the
applicable conversion price will not be lower than 85 of the 5-day VWAP on the applicable Closing Date (the Floor
Price nor will the applicable conversion price be higher than 3.50 per share (the Ceiling Price the Floor
Price and Ceiling Price shall automatically adjust in the event of a stock split or consolidation by the Company. The Floor Price
for the investors who participated in this initial closing is equal to 2.68 per share. Since the Floor Price is tied to the Closing
Date, the Floor Price may be different for investors that are part of a different closing, should the Company hold additional
closings. The Investors were granted piggyback registration rights for the shares of Common Stock underlying the Note. 

The
Note Purchase Agreement NPA also contains customary representation and warranties of the Company and the Investors, indemnification
obligations of the Company, termination provisions, and other obligations and rights of the parties. 

The
foregoing description of the NPA and the Note is qualified by reference to the full text of the forms of NPA and Note, which are filed
as Exhibits hereto and incorporated herein by reference. 

Plan
of Operations 

We
have been developing our materials and characterization capabilities at our headquarters in Goleta, California, in connection with the
further development of our business and the implementation of our plan of operations. We have installed key manufacturing equipment at
our headquarters and will continue to develop relationships with manufacturing partners to carry out certain steps of our manufacturing
processes externally. We have gained access to a rapid prototyping facility and are leveraging this access to fabricate early-stage prototypes.
In the future, we intend to implement appropriate quality and manufacturing controls. Some equipment was procured previously, and other
equipment is being procured through purchase orders with equipment vendors. 

The
primary sources of funding for equipment procurement and installation are the seed funding raised prior to becoming a public company
and the funding raised from our financings. We have also leveraged funds to continue strengthening our intellectual property including
patent applications, trademarks, and development of trade secrets and manufacturing process recipes. We will continue to develop our
manufacturing and product development strategy by further engaging customers and strategic partners. 

Limited
Operating History 

We
cannot guarantee that the proceeds from the Offering will be sufficient to carry out all of our business plans. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources, risks inherent in the research and development process
and possible rejection of our products in development. 

If
financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to carry out all of our operations. Equity financing will result in
dilution to existing stockholders. 

Components

benefits, costs associated with design, fabrication, packaging and testing of our devices, and facility lease and utility expenses. We
expense research and development expenses as incurred. 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and
employee benefits. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party consulting, legal, insurance, audit and
accounting services, and office lease and utility expenses. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Interest
income consists primarily of interest earned in interest-bearing savings account in bank. 

Amortization
of discount on convertible notes represents the non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of convertible notes issued
to our debtholders. 

Changes
in the fair value of derivative liabilities reflect valuation changes in the derivatives held by the Company.

for the same period in 2023.

of revenue associated with increased revenue and higher seasonal utility charges. 

Other income (expense): Other income (expense)
consists of amortization of discount on convertible notes of 144,776), changes in fair value of derivative liabilities of 146,435 and
interest income of 102 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Impact
of COVID-19 

With
the exception of some lingering supply chain challenges, the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact
on the Company s results of operations or financial condition for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Capital
Resources and Liquidity 

Our financial statements have been presented on
the basis that are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course
of business. As presented in the financial statements, we incurred a net loss of 729,619 and 1,482,309 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and losses are expected to continue in the near term. The accumulated deficit was 14,353,980 at September
30, 2024. We have been funding our operations through the sale of common stock in private placement transactions. 

Management
anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to develop and expand our business before significant positive
operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital
and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. At September 30, 2024, we had 3,502,520 of cash and cash equivalents.
These funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need to seek additional funds, primarily through
the issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will
be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing,
it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders,
in the case of equity financing. 

Management
has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and
beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) controlling overhead and expenses; (c) executing
material sales or research contracts; and (d) pursuing additional sales and contracts. There can be no assurance that we can successfully
accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that we will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There
can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. As of the
date of this Report, we have not entered into any formal agreements regarding the above. 

In
the event we are unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors by
filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not considered
this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence. 

We had working capital of 1,395,817 and 766,160
at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Current assets increased 2,634,144 to 4,026,990 at September 30, 2024 from 1,392,846
at September 30, 2024, primarily due to a 2,211,448 increase in cash. Current liabilities increased 2,004,487 to 2,631,173 at September
30, 2024 from 626,686 at June 30, 2024, due primarily to increases in derivative liabilities. 

The
following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented:

Net cash used in our operating activities were
 931,915 and 1,303,362 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due primarily to net losses of 729,619
and 1,482,309 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Net
cash used in our investing activities was 1,637 and 7,100 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Investing
activities include purchase of equipment. 

Net
cash provided by our financing activities was 3,145,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and net cash used in our financing
activities was 4,001 for the same period of 2023. We received 3,145,000 from issuing convertible notes for the three months ended September
30, 20214 and paid 4,001 to purchase Lee McCarthy s unvested restricted shares for the same period of 2023. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies. (not needed) 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

Our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter
how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will
be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, have been detected. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance. 

Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered
by this Report. Based on this evaluation, management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, concluded
that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our current staffing resources in our finance
department are insufficient to support the complexity of our financial reporting requirements. As a result, we have had an inadequate
level of precision, evidence or timeliness in the performance of review controls. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

its business. To the best of our knowledge, we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations; however, we may become involved
in material legal proceedings in the future.
