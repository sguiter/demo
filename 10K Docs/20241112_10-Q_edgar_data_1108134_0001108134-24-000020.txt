Conversely, securities rated below investment grade are considered to have distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade securities. For securities without credit ratings, the Company utilizes other financial information indicating the financial health of the underlying municipality, agency, or organization. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, none of the Company's investment securities were delinquent or in non-accrual status.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, million of consumer loans were reclassified to loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting the Company's intent to sell these loans. Held for sale loans are not contained in the balances within this note and are accounted for at the lower of carrying value or fair market value. 
 
 Risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows: 
 Construction - Loans in this segment primarily include real estate development loans for which payment is derived from sale of the property or long term financing at completion. Credit risk is affected by cost overruns, time to sell at an adequate price, and market conditions. 
 
 Commercial real estate multifamily, owner occupied and non-owner - Loans in these segments are primarily owner-occupied or income-producing properties throughout New England and Northeastern New York. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties are adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy, which in turn, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. Management monitors the cash flows of these loans. 
 
 Commercial and industrial loans - Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business such as accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, other liquid collateral, equipment and other business assets. Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. Loans in this segment include asset based loans which generally have no scheduled repayment and which are closely monitored against formula based collateral advance ratios. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 
 
 Residential real estate - All loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 
 
 Home equity and other consumer loans - Loans in this segment are primarily home equity lines of credit, automobile loans and other consumer loans. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.

Substandard, including non-accruing loans, are loans for which a definitive weakness has been identified and which may make full collection of contractual cash flows questionable. Doubtful loans are those with identified weaknesses that make full collection of contractual cash flows, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
 
 For commercial credits, the Company assigns an internal risk rating at origination and reviews the rating annual, semiannually, or quarterly depending on the risk rating. The rating is also reassessed at any point in time when management becomes aware of information that may affect the borrower s ability to fulfill their obligations. 
 
 The Company risk rates its residential mortgages, including 1-4 family and residential construction loans, based on a three rating system: Pass, Special Mention, and Substandard. Loans that are current within 59 days are rated Pass. Residential mortgages that are 60-89 days delinquent are rated Special Mention. Loans delinquent for 90 days or greater are rated Substandard and generally placed on non-accrual status.

 billion. That amount included billion in interest rate swap derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The Company also had economic hedges totaling billion and million non-hedging derivatives, which are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes with changes in fair value recorded directly through earnings. Economic hedges included interest rate swaps totaling billion, risk participation agreements with dealer banks of billion, and million in forward commitment contracts. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company held derivatives with a total notional amount of billion. That amount included billion in interest rate swap derivatives and billion in interest rate collars that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The Company had economic hedges and non-hedging derivatives totaling billion and million, respectively, which are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are therefore recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded directly through earnings. Economic hedges included interest rate swaps totaling billion, risk participation agreements with dealer banks of million, and million in forward commitment contracts. 
 
 As part of the Company s risk management strategy, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in certain of the Company s assets and liabilities. Interest rate swap agreements involve the risk of dealing with both Bank customers and institutional derivative counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. The agreements are entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and contain master netting and collateral provisions protecting the at-risk party. The derivatives program is overseen by the Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. Based on adherence to the Company s credit standards and the presence of the netting and collateral provisions, the Company believes that the credit risk inherent in these contracts was not significant at September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company had pledged collateral to derivative counterparties in the form of cash as of September 30, 2024. The Company had pledged securities to derivative counterparties with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not typically require its commercial customers to post cash or securities as collateral on its program of back-to-back economic hedges. However certain language is written into the International Swaps Dealers Association, Inc. ISDA and loan documents where, in default situations, the Bank is allowed to access collateral supporting the loan relationship to recover any losses suffered on the derivative asset or liability. The Company may need to post additional collateral in the future in proportion to potential increases in unrealized loss positions.

 interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of million. The interest rate swaps have durations of one to . This hedge strategy converts commercial variable rate loans to fixed interest rates, thereby protecting the Company from floating interest rate variability. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had interest rate collars. The first interest rate collar has a floor and a cap with a notional value of million. The second interest rate collar has a floor and a cap with a notional value of million. The interest rate collars have durations of one to . The structure of these instruments is such that the Company pays the counterparty an incremental amount if the collar index exceeds the cap rate. Conversely, the Company receives an incremental amount if the index falls below the floor rate. No payments are required if the collar index falls between the cap and floor rates.

 million notional amount to swap out the fixed rate of interest on an economic development bond bearing a fixed rate of , currently within the Company s trading portfolio under the fair value option, in exchange for a SOFR-based floating rate. The intent of the economic hedge is to improve the Company s asset sensitivity to changing interest rates in anticipation of favorable average floating rates of interest over the -year life of the bond. The fair value changes of the economic development bond are mostly offset by fair value changes of the related interest rate swap. 
 
 The Company also offers certain derivative products directly to qualified commercial borrowers. The Company economically hedges derivative transactions executed with commercial borrowers by entering into mirror-image, offsetting derivatives with third-party financial institutions. The transaction allows the Company s customer to convert a variable-rate loan to a fixed rate loan. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for its customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts mostly offset each other in earnings. There was credit valuation loss adjustment arising from the difference in credit worthiness of the commercial loan and financial institution counterparties as of September 30, 2024. The interest income and expense on these mirror image swaps exactly offset each other. 
 
 The Company has risk participation agreements with dealer banks. Risk participation agreements occur when the Company participates on a loan and a swap where another bank is the lead. The Company gets paid a fee to take on the risk associated with having to make the lead bank whole on Berkshire s portion of the pro-rated swap should the borrower default. Changes in fair value are recorded in current period earnings. 
 
 The Company utilizes forward sale commitments to hedge interest rate risk and the associated effects on the fair value of interest rate lock commitments and loans originated for sale. The forward sale commitments are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recorded in current period earnings. 
 
 The Company uses the following types of forward sale commitments contracts: 
 Best efforts loan sales, 
 Mandatory delivery loan sales, and 
 To Be Announced TBA mortgage-backed securities sales. 
 
 A best efforts contract refers to a loan sale agreement where the Company commits to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. The Company may enter into a best efforts contract once the price is known, which is shortly after the potential borrower s interest rate is locked. 
 
 A mandatory delivery contract is a loan sale agreement where the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date. Generally, the Company may enter into mandatory delivery contracts shortly after the loan closes with a customer. 
 
 The Company may sell TBA mortgage-backed securities to hedge the changes in fair value of interest rate lock commitments and held for sale loans, which do not have corresponding best efforts or mandatory delivery contracts. These security sales transactions are closed once mandatory contracts are written. On the closing date the price of the security is locked-in, and the sale is paired-off with a purchase of the same security. Settlement of the security purchase/sale transaction is done with cash on a net-basis.

 The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. At each date shown, the Company met the minimum capital requirements and the Bank met the conditions to be classified as well capitalized under the relevant regulatory framework. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, tier 1 risk-based, and tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table above. 
 
 As of January 1, 2019, banking organizations must maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0 , a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5 , and a minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5 , including a 2.5 capital conservation buffer. Capital rules impose restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary cash bonus payments if the capital conservation buffer is not met. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the capital levels of both the Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes.

security designated as a trading security. It is a tax-advantaged economic development bond issued to the Company by a local nonprofit which provides wellness and health programs. The fair value of this security is determined based on a discounted cash flow methodology. Certain inputs to the fair value calculation are unobservable and there is little to no market activity in the security; therefore, the security meets the definition of a Level 3 security. The discount rate used in the valuation of the security is sensitive to movements in the 3-month SOFR rate. 
 
 Securities Available for Sale and Equity Securities . Equity securities classified as Level 1 consist of publicly-traded equity securities for which the fair values can be obtained through quoted market prices in active exchange markets. Equity securities classified as Level 2 consist of securities with infrequent trades in active exchange markets, and pricing is primarily sourced from third party pricing services. AFS securities classified as Level 1 consist of U.S. Treasury securities. AFS securities classified as Level 2 include most of the Company s debt securities. The pricing on Level 2 and Level 3 was primarily sourced from third party pricing services, overseen by management, and is based on models that consider standard input factors such as dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and condition, among other things. Level 3 pricing includes inputs unobservable to market participants. 
 
 Loans Held for Investment. The Company s held for investment loan portfolio includes loans originated by Company and loans acquired through business combinations. The Company intends to hold these assets until maturity as a part of its business operations. For one acquired portfolio subset, the Company previously accounted for these purchased-credit impaired loans as a pool under ASC 310, as they were determined to have common risk characteristics. These loans were recorded at fair value on acquisition date and subsequently evaluated for impairment collectively. Upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company elected the fair value option on this portfolio, recognizing an million fair value write-down charged to retained earnings, net of deferred tax impact, as of January 1, 2020. The fair value of this loan portfolio is determined based on a discounted cash flow methodology. Certain inputs to the fair value calculation are unobservable; therefore, the loans meet the definition of Level 3 assets. The discount rate used in the valuation is consistent with assets that have significant credit deterioration. The cash flow assumptions include payment schedules for loans with current payment histories and estimated collateral value for delinquent loans. All of these loans were nonperforming as of September 30, 2024.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, originations of loans held for sale totaled million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales of loans originated for sale totaled million and million, respectively.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, sales of loans originated for sale totaled million and million, respectively. 
 
 Interest Rate Swaps. The valuation of the Company s interest rate swaps is obtained from a third-party pricing service and is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The pricing analysis is based on observable inputs for the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity and interest rate curves. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings. 
 
 Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Commitments to Lend. The Company enters into commitments to lend for residential mortgage loans intended for sale, which commit the Company to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specific interest rate and within a specified period of time. The estimated fair value of commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale is based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets. However, this value is adjusted by a factor which considers the likelihood that the loan in a lock position will ultimately close, and by the non-refundable costs of originating the loan. The closing ratio is derived from the Bank s internal data and is adjusted using significant management judgment. The costs to originate are primarily based on the Company s internal commission rates that are not observable. As such, these commitments are classified as Level 3 measurements.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 This document contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ). These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company s GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item which management excludes when computing non-GAAP operating earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company s results for any particular quarter or year. The Company s non-GAAP operating earnings information set forth is not necessarily comparable to non- GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. Each non-GAAP measure used by the Company in this report as supplemental financial data should be considered in conjunction with the Company s GAAP financial information. 
 
 The Company utilizes the non-GAAP measure of operating earnings in evaluating operating trends, including components for operating revenue and expense. These measures exclude amounts which the Company views as unrelated to its normalized operations. These items primarily include restructuring costs. Restructuring costs generally consist of costs and losses associated with the disposition of assets and liabilities and lease terminations, including costs related to branch sales. 
 
 The Company also calculates operating earnings per share based on its measure of operating earnings and diluted common shares. The Company views these amounts as important to understanding its operating trends, particularly due to the impact of accounting standards related to merger and acquisition activity. Analysts also rely on these measures in estimating and evaluating the Company s performance. Adjustments in 2024 were primarily related to branch sales and loss on sale of AFS securities. Adjustments in 2023 were primarily related to branch consolidations. 
 
 Management believes that the computation of non-GAAP operating earnings and operating earnings per share may facilitate the comparison of the Company to other companies in the financial services industry. The Company also adjusts certain equity related measures to exclude intangible assets due to the importance of these measures to the investment community.

 GENERAL 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in 
 understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this document and with the Company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the following discussion, income statement comparisons are against the same period of the previous year and balance sheet comparisons are against the previous fiscal year-end, unless otherwise noted. Financial results discussed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results for the year 2024 or any future period. In management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. Tax-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-advantaged loans and securities by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 27 marginal rate (including state income taxes net of federal benefit). In the discussion, unless otherwise specified, references to earnings per share and "EPS" refer to diluted earnings per common share.

 OVERVIEW 
 
 Third quarter 2024 earnings per share increased 96 year-over-year to 0.88 from 0.45 due primarily to a non-operating gain of 0.30 per share after-tax recorded on the sale of ten branches in the state of New York. This sale was announced in the first quarter of 2024 and was completed on schedule in the third quarter. The non-GAAP measure of operating earnings per share increased 16 to 0.58 from 0.50 including the benefit of fee income growth, reduced operating expenses, and lower credit loss provision expense. 
 
 For the first nine months of the year, earnings per share decreased 40 year-over-year to 0.97 from 1.63 due primarily to a non-operating loss of 0.89 per share after-tax on the sale of investment securities in the first quarter of 2024. These securities were carried at fair value on the Company s balance sheet and this loss therefore had no effect on shareholders equity. Year-to-date operating earnings per share, excluding the securities loss and branch sale gain, decreased 4 to 1.61 from 1.67 primarily due to a lower net interest margin reflecting ongoing impacts of rising deposit costs. 
 
 The Company s return on tangible common equity was 14.83 for the third quarter and 5.80 for the first nine months of 2024. The non-GAAP measure of operating return on tangible common equity was 9.91 and 9.43 for the above respective periods. Sequential growth in quarterly operating earnings in 2024 has contributed to sequential improvements in the Company s capital profile. The third quarter return on assets measured 1.28 in 2024, while the non-GAAP measure of operating return on assets reached a five quarter high of 0.85 . 
 
 Total assets decreased 7 to 11.6 billion at period-end from 12.4 billion at year-end 2023, primarily reflecting lower cash and equivalents used as consideration in the branch sale and a reduction from seasonally high overnight customer deposits at the end of 2023. Total loans increased 2 year-to-date, with growth in all major categories except consumer loans, which reflected the targeted runoff and sale of installment loans. Excluding the 383 million in deposits sold, average quarterly deposits decreased 2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 The branch sale was another step in the Bank s efforts to create efficiencies in its branch network to support investment in its bankers and client experience. It was targeted to improve long-term operating earnings and profitability while avoiding layoffs and the costs of real estate dispositions. The sale concentrates the Bank s overall geographic footprint and reduces certain expenses. With the sale of the ten branches, Berkshire s total branch count was reduced to 83 offices in New England and New York, including 16 offices in its Albany and Rome/Utica markets. 
 
 Measures of asset quality remained favorable in the first nine months of 2024. Delinquent and non-performing loans were 0.53 of total period-end loans; this was the lowest quarterly level in more than 15 years. 
 
 Liquidity remained satisfactory in 2024. The ratio of loans to deposits measured 96 at period-end, compared to 85 at the start of the year. Capital further strengthened, with the ratio of equity to assets increasing to 9.2 from 8.1 . Period-end book value per share grew 7 to 24.90 and the non-GAAP measure of tangible book value per share also advanced 7 to 24.53. 
 
 In September 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank reduced the target Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points, with the effective rate decreasing to 4.83 from 5.33 . The target rate had been raised beginning in March 2022, with the effect of an increase from an effective rate of 0.08 and reaching 5.33 in August 2023. At the time when the target rate was reduced, the median projection by the Federal Reserve Board governors predicted a further 50 basis point reduction by year-end 2024, and an additional 100 basis point reduction by year-end 2025. This significant change in policy has contributed to focus in the banking industry about the future direction of bank net interest margins. The yield curve for treasury obligations has become less inverted following a prolonged period of inversion. Historically, industry revenues have responded positively to the normalization of the yield curve following periods of inversion. 
 
 In June 2024, Senior Managing Director and Chief Accounting Officer Brett Brbovic was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, replacing R. David Rosato. During 2024, the Company also announced the recruitment of commercial deposit relationship managers and private bankers. Additionally, it announced the planned move and expansion of a Boston branch to support the expanded commercial and private banking teams

 serving the Greater Boston market. In the most recent quarter, the Bank launched Berkshire One, its innovative suite of digital-first banking solutions to complement its branch and concierge banking channels. 
 
 COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 
 Summary. Third quarter 2024 net income increased year-over-year 18 million, or 92 , to 38 million due primarily to a non-operating gain of 16 million recorded on the sale of ten branches in the state of New York. The non-GAAP measure of operating income increased year-over-year 3 million, or 15 , to 25 million due to the benefit of reduced operating expenses and lower credit loss provision expense. 
 
 For the first nine months of the year, net income decreased 30 million, or 42 to 41 million due primarily to a non-operating loss of 50 million on the sale of securities in the first quarter. These securities were carried at fair value on the Company s balance sheet and this loss therefore had no effect on shareholders equity. Year-to-date operating income, excluding the securities loss and branch sale gain, decreased 4 million, or 6 , to 69 million. 
 
 Lower year-to-date operating results primarily reflected a lower net interest margin due to ongoing impacts of rising deposit costs. The Company has adjusted to these impacts with calibrated loan growth, improving credit quality, and continued expense management. Additionally, the securities sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 facilitated the reduction of higher costing funds with proceeds from the sale of lower yielding securities, as well as reinvestment in higher yielding short-term investments. 
 
 Nine month operating expenses were reduced through focused expense disciplines together with branch consolidations and the branch sale. Due to the margin pressures, the nine month efficiency ratio measured 64.45 in 2024 compared to 62.65 in 2023. The efficiency ratio improved to 63.74 in the most recent quarter, reflecting the cumulative benefit of the Company s profitability initiatives. Earnings have also benefited from lower credit loss provision expense in 2024 even as the Company has increased the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2024, the Company elected the proportional amortization method for its tax credit equity investments in public welfare investment projects which consist of Affordable Housing and New Market tax credit 
 investments. This election had no impact on net income. As a result of this election, certain noncash charges which had been posted to non-interest income are now posted to income tax expense. As a result, non-interest income, total revenue, and tax expense are not comparable on a year-over-year basis. The amount charged against non-interest income and credited to tax expense in 2023 was 1.5 million in the third quarter and 6.0 million of the first nine months of the year. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Third quarter net interest income decreased year-over-year by 2 million, or 3 , to 88 million due to a 2 decrease in average earning assets and a 2 basis point reduction in the net interest margin to 3.16 from 3.18 . The decrease in average earning assets reflected the use of funds from securities sales to pay down higher cost borrowings. The net interest margin reached a recent low of 3.11 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and then increased to 3.20 in the second quarter of 2024 including the benefit of the sale of 362 million in lower yielding securities. The margin decreased to 3.16 in the most recent quarter including the impact of the sale of deposits in branches that were sold. Including deposits held for sale, total average deposits decreased 160 million, or 2 , linked quarter. Branches sold in the final week of the third quarter included deposits totaling 159 million which were included in average deposits in the quarter. 
 
 The third quarter 2024 yield on earning assets increased year-over-year by 43 basis points, while the cost of funds increased by 49 basis points. This differential was primarily driven by the differential between the yield on loans, which increased 23 basis points compared to the cost of deposits, which increased 61 basis points year-over-year. The Federal Reserve Bank shift in policy in the most recent quarter towards lowering interest rates was too late to result in lower quarter-over-quarter changes in yields and costs. 
 
 On a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, an 831 million decrease in lower yielding average investment securities funded a 281 million increase in average loans, a 296 million increase in average short-term 
 76 

Table of Contents 

 investments, and a 228 million decrease in average borrowings. The 3 increase in average loans was primarily due to a 332 million increase in higher yielding average commercial real estate loans. 
 
 For the first nine months of the year, net interest income decreased year-over-year by 16 million, or 6 . This was primarily due to a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.17 from 3.33 primarily due to rising deposit costs, together with a 1 decrease in average earning assets. 
 
 Non-Interest Income. Third quarter non-interest income increased year-over-year by 20 million, or 115 , due primarily to the 16 million gain on the branch sale. 
 
 As previously noted, total non-interest income is not comparable year-over-year due to the change in tax accounting in 2024. Third quarter fee income increased year-over-year including a 12 increase in loan related fees, a 19 increase in SBA loan sale gains, and an 8 increase in wealth management fees. This growth generally represented increased business volume and benefited from the Company s investment in front line staff and technology. 
 
 For the first nine months of the year, total non-interest income decreased 26 million, or 51 , due primarily to the 50 million first quarter loss on the sale of securities partially offset by the 16 million third quarter gain on the branch sale. The four fee income categories collectively were stable from year to year. Fee income increased sequentially in each of the quarters in 2024. 
 
 Provision Expense for Credit Losses. Provision expense decreased year-over-year by 2.5 million, or 31 , in the third quarter and by 7 million, or 28 , for the first nine months. Nine month net loan charge-offs decreased 37 to 11 million and measured 0.16 of average loans in 2024 compared to 0.28 in 2023. The 2024 provision resulted in a 7 million increase to 112 million in the allowance for credit losses on loans and an increase in the ratio of the allowance to total loans to 1.22 at period-end compared to 1.17 at the start of the year. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense . Non-interest expense decreased year-over-year by 5 million, or 6 , for the third quarter and by 4 million, or 2 for the first nine months of the year. The non-GAAP measure of operating non-interest expense decreased by 2 for both of these periods, declining 2 million for the third quarter and 4 million for the year-to-date. 
 
 For the year-to-date, the largest decrease in operating expense was occupancy, which decreased 3 million or 11 . This included the impact of four branch consolidations in 2023, three branch consolidations in 2024, and ten branches sold in 2024, together with dispositions of other excess properties. Of note, the sales of eight of the branches sold were completed near the end of the most recent quarter. Year-to-date marketing expense was reduced by 2 million, or 41 , primarily due to the streamlining of certain media contracts. Nine month compensation expense increased by 2 million, or 2 . Full time equivalent staff totaled 1,232 at period-end, compared to 1,340 at the start of the year. All staff related to the ten branches sold were offered employment by the branch buyers. FTE staff was reduced by 40 positions as a result of the branch sale, and staff count was reduced based on a workforce realignment in the first quarter of the year. The Company is focused on efficiencies to reduce overhead and to deepen its investment in frontline staff and customer engagement technology. 
 
 Operating non-interest expense decreased sequentially in recent quarters due to the Company s initiatives. In the most recent quarter, the category of other expenses increased 2 million over the prior quarter due primarily to one commercial check fraud. Excluding this item, total operating expense decreased compared to the linked quarter. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. As previously noted, income tax expense in 2024 is not comparable to 2023 and prior years due to the change in the accounting method for certain equity tax credit investments. In 2024, the effective income tax rate was 22 for the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year.

COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND DECEMBER 31, 2023 
 
 General. Total assets decreased 0.8 billion, or 7 , to 11.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024. Short-term investments and total deposits declined from elevated year-end 2023 levels. Investment securities declined in line with the deposits transferred in the sale of ten branches. Total loans increased from organic growth, net of balances sold, and there was a corresponding increase in borrowings. Loans/deposits increased to 96 from 85 . Equity/assets increased to 9.2 from 8.1 . 
 
 Investment Securities. Investment securities decreased by 0.4 billion, or 24 , to 1.2 billion during the first nine months of the year. This was primarily due to the sale of lower yielding securities near the end of the first quarter. This improved the Company s liquidity in advance of the branch sale and benefited earnings as the sale proceeds were used to pay down higher cost funds. The yield on the securities portfolio was 2.49 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.40 in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Loans. Total loans increased 0.2 billion, or 2 , to 9.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, primarily reflecting balanced ongoing commercial originations. In 2024, the Company sold 47 million in seasoned residential mortgages early in the third quarter and transferred 47 million in consumer loans to held for sale at the end of the third quarter; this sale was completed in October. Additionally, the Company sold 50 million in residential mortgage and consumer loan balances as part of the branch sale. Adjusted for these balances sold, total loans increased 4 for the year-to-date. The yield on total loans was 6.11 in the most recent quarter, compared to 5.97 in the final quarter of 2023. 
 
 Commercial loans comprised 66 of total loans and increased 0.3 billion, or 5 , to 6.1 billion during the first nine months of 2024. Growth was recorded in all major categories of commercial loans, including an 11 increase in multifamily loans and a 22 increase in owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. Based on the supervisory definition of commercial real estate loans which excludes owner-occupied properties, the supervisory measure of commercial real estate loans to total bank regulatory capital measured 283 at period-end, compared to 286 at year-end 2023. The supervisory measure of construction loans to bank regulatory capital measured 50 and 51 at the above respective dates. 
 
 The Company has a diversified commercial real estate portfolio primarily located in suburban markets in its footprint. The commercial real estate loan portfolio increased 0.2 billion, or 6 , to 4.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024, and constituted 51 of the total loan portfolio at period-end. There were 1 million in net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans in the first nine months of 2024. Nonaccruing loans were 0.22 of total commercial real estate loans at period-end compared to 0.10 at year-end 2023. Period-end loans rated substandard were 1.41 of commercial real estate loans, compared to 1.95 at year-end 2023. At period-end, the largest property type concentrations (over 5 of the portfolio and excluding construction loans) were retail trade (20 ), multifamily (14 ), office (11 ), healthcare (9 ), and hospitality (7 ). The largest category, retail trade, was primarily comprised of properties anchored by strong grocery and big box tenants in suburban areas with no significant tenant concentrations, and negligible indoor mall exposure. The 502 million office portfolio was approximately 70 composed of Class A properties and approximately 76 of the office portfolio was maturing after 2025. Boston properties were 16 of the office portfolio, with no high-rise office buildings. Construction loans consisted primarily of multifamily (approximately 46 and industrial (approximately 14 at period-end. 
 
 Residential mortgage loans comprised 30 of loans and were unchanged at 2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024. Consumer loans comprised 4 of loans and decreased 0.1 billion, or 23 , for the year-to-date. This was largely due to targeted run-off and sales of unsecured consumer installment loans. 
 
 Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 
 Loan performance indicators were little changed since year-end 2023 and remained at historically favorable levels. Total delinquent and non-performing loans measured 0.53 of loans at period-end, compared to 0.54 at the start of the year. This was the lowest quarterly level in more than 15 years. It included non-performing loans measuring 0.26 and 0.24 of total loans at the above respective dates. 
 78 

Table of Contents 

Annualized year-to-date net loan charge-offs measured 0.16 of average loans compared to 0.26 for the year 2023. Criticized loans/total loans decreased to 2.51 of total loans from 2.71 in the first nine months of the year, including a reduction in classified loans to 1.38 of loans from 1.69 of loans. Potential problems loans, which are defined as accruing classified loans, decreased to 103 million from 132 million for the year-to-date. Improvements in borrower risk ratings have generally reflected borrowers adjusting operations to mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate loans and to the impact of changing supply/demand conditions. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans increased by 7 million, or 6 , to 112 million during the first nine months of the year. In addition to reflecting the 2 loan growth, this also reflected an increase in the ratio of the allowance to total loans to 1.22 from 1.17 . The increase in reserve coverage reflected increases in all major loan categories except non-owner occupied commercial real estate, for which the ratio of the allowance to loans decreased to 1.41 from 1.47 . The largest increase was the reserve related to commercial and industrial loans, which grew by 5 million, increasing to 1.71 of loans from 1.37 . Due to the sale of consumer loans, the related reserve decreased by 5 million, while the coverage ratio increased to 6.08 from 5.46 . Consumer loans include home equity loans and installment loans. Factors contributing to higher reserves included longer expected loan lives and increased qualitative reserves related to macroeconomic and federal policy uncertainties. 
 
 Deposits and Borrowings. For the first nine months of the year, total deposits decreased by 1.1 billion, or 10 , to 9.6 billion. This included the sale of 0.4 billion in deposits due to the sale of ten branches in the third quarter. All categories of deposits decreased, including a reduction in short-term payroll related balances which vary daily and which were elevated at year-end 2023. Average deposits in the most recent quarter were 9.4 billion, decreasing 0.6 billion, or 6 , from the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding deposits sold, average deposits decreased 0.2 billion, or 2 . 
 
 The branch sale included 383 million in deposits, consisting of 77 million of non-interest bearing deposits, 25 million of NOW deposits, 77 million of money market deposits, 45 million of savings deposits, and 159 million of time deposits. Approximately 224 million in deposits were sold early in the first month of the quarter and 158 million were sold near the end of the quarter. The average balance of deposits held for sale was 259 million in the third quarter and included some accounts which were not sold because client selected deposit retention exceeded expectations. 
 
 Non-interest bearing deposits were 24 of average deposits in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 25 in the fourth quarter of 2023. All major categories of average deposits decreased between these two periods, primarily in transaction deposits. The total cost of deposits increased to 2.42 in the most recent quarter compared to 2.11 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The cost of deposits held for sale in the most recent quarter was 2.30 . 
 
 Total borrowings increased year-to-date by 0.2 billion, or 40 , to 0.8 billion. The cost of borrowings was unchanged at 5.4 in the most recent quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Average borrowings increased by 0.1 billion, or 15 , to 0.7 billion in the most recent quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
 The notional amount of derivative financial instruments totaled 4.8 billion at period-end, which was unchanged from year-end 2023. The net fair value of these instruments at period-end was a liability of 19 million, decreasing from a liability of 30 million at year-end 2023. Included in derivative financial instruments are 800 million in cash flow hedges on commercial loans, of which 275 million mature in 2025, 425 million mature in 2026, and 100 million mature in 2027. The Company recorded a 473 thousand charge to interest expense for the realized loss on cash flow hedging instruments in the first nine months of 2024.

 Shareholders Equity. Capital measures remained strong and improved in the first nine months of 2024. Total shareholders equity increased 58 million, or 6 , to 1.1 billion. The 50 million loss on the first quarter sale of securities resulted in a credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss and an offsetting charge against earnings. Year-to-date net income totaled 41 million, dividends totaled 23 million, and share repurchases totaled 18 million. Excluding the securities loss, which had no impact on total equity, net income for the first nine months of 2024 totaled 80 million, which was the primary reason for the 6 increase in total equity. 
 
 Book value per share increased by 1.63, or 7 , to 24.90 in the first nine months of 2024. The non-GAAP measure of tangible book value per share increased by 1.71, or 7 , to 24.53. Share repurchases in 2024 were accretive to book value measures, based on the average repurchase price of approximately 21.94. 
 
 Reflecting the increase in equity and the decrease in total assets, the ratio of equity to assets increased to 9.2 from 8.1 and the non-GAAP measure of tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to 9.1 from 8.0 . The common equity Tier 1 capital ratio measured 12.0 at both period-end and year-end 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Cash Flows 
 
 Liquidity is defined as the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet all present and future funding requirements at reasonable costs for the Company, including the Bank. Liquidity management addresses both the Company s ability to fund new loans and investments pursuant to commitments and as opportunities arise, to meet customer deposit withdrawals and to repay borrowings and subordinated notes as they mature. The Company views its liquidity as satisfactory for current conditions as well as for stressed scenarios in its liquidity testing models. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, liquid assets totaling 1.2 billion included cash and equivalents totaling 0.6 billion and securities available for sale totaling 0.6 billion. At year-end 2023 liquid assets were 2.2 billion, including 1.2 billion in cash and equivalents and 1.0 billion in securities available for sale. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, wholesale funds totaled 1.2 billion, including 0.7 billion in borrowings and 0.5 billion in brokered deposits. At year-end 2023, wholesale funds totaled 1.0 billion evenly split between borrowings and brokered deposits. 
 
 Unused borrowing availability at period-end from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston FHLBB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston FRB totaled 3.7 billion, compared to 4.0 billion at year-end 2023. Borrowings from these sources are supported by collateral, to the extent utilized. Cash balances at the holding company totaled 71 million at period-end. 
 
 During the first nine months of 2024, total cash and equivalents decreased to 0.6 billion from 1.2 billion as deposits decreased from elevated overnight levels at year-end 2023. For the year-to-date, the primary source of funds was securities sales totaling 0.4 billion and the primary additional uses of funds were the outflow of 0.3 billion due to the branch sale and 0.3 billion in net loan growth. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 Please see the Shareholders Equity section of the Comparison of Financial Condition for a discussion of shareholders equity together with the note on Shareholders' Equity in the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about capital resources and regulatory capital is contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the Company's most recent Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company s goal is to maintain sound capitalization and use capital generation to support organic growth and shareholder distributions in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. The Company s goal is to maintain a well-capitalized regulatory designation under projected and stressed financial projections. 
 
 In most recent periods, the Company has returned excess capital to shareholders through stock repurchases. The Company s long-term goal is to maintain an efficient capital structure and to provide a return in excess of the cost of its common equity capital.

 As a result of rising interest rates, available for sale bond portfolios in banks are generally subject to unrealized losses which result in charges against accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and reduce the book value of shareholders equity. Like many of its peers, the Company utilizes an option in reporting its regulatory equity which excludes changes in AOCI in the calculation of regulatory capital. Reductions in bond valuations due to changes in market interest rates are reversed as bonds approach maturity. These reversals are accreted to AOCI over time, restoring the book value of equity. The balance of AOCI was a loss of 89 million at period-end, compared to a loss of 143 million at year-end 2023. This reduction was primarily due to the realization of 50 million in losses with the securities sale in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 While the Company monitors the book value of equity and related metrics, it primarily manages capital based on regulatory capital measures, with a focus on the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. This ratio measured 12.0 both at period-end and year-end 2023. 
 
 In acting as a source of strength for the Bank, the Company relies in the long term on capital distributions from the Bank in order to provide operating and capital service for the Company, which in turn can access national financial markets to provide financial support to the Bank. Capital distributions from the Bank to the parent company presently require approval by the FDIC. 
 
 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 
 included in its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Modifications to significant accounting policies made during the year are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this report. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 Management has identified the Company's most critical accounting policies as related to: 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 These policies are considered most critical in that they are important to the Company s financial condition and results, and they require management s subjective and complex judgment as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Both of these policies were significant in determining income and financial condition in the financial statements. There is further discussion of the application of these policies in the Form 10-K.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 For additional discussion about the Company s Quantitative and Qualitative Aspects of Market Risk, please review Item 7A of the most recent report on Form 10-K which sets forth the methodologies employed by the Company and the various aspects of its analysis of its interest rate sensitivity. 
 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss to earnings, capital and the economic values of certain assets and liabilities resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices. The only significant market risk exposure for the Company is Interest Rate Risk IRR ). This is a result of the Company s core business activities of making loans and accepting deposits, as well as investments and funding activities. 
 
 The effective management of IRR is essential to achieving the Company s financial objectives. This responsibility resides with the Asset Liability Committee ALCO ). The ALCO s role is to establish an effective asset/liability decision-making process to aid in managing risk exposures and achieving strategic objectives and corporate financial goals. The Company manages IRR by using two primary risk measurement techniques: simulation of net interest income and simulation of economic value of equity. These two measurements are complementary and provide both short-term and long-term risk profiles of the Company. 
 
 Net Interest Income NII at Risk Simulation is used to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market rates over a 12 month period assuming a static balance sheet. This simulation captures underlying product behaviors, such as asset and liability repricing dates, balloon dates, interest rate indices and spreads, rate caps and floors, as well as other behavioral attributes. The simulation of net interest income also requires a number of key assumptions such as (i) prepayment projections for loans and securities; (ii) new business loan spreads; and (iii) deposit pricing assumptions. Combined, these assumptions can be inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results may differ from simulation forecasts due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, future business conditions, as well as unanticipated changes in management strategies. 
 
 The Company uses two sets of standard scenarios to measure NII Sensitivity. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario, while twist scenarios assume the shape of the curve flattens or steepens instantaneously. 
 
 The following tables set forth the estimated percent change in the Company s NII Sensitivity compared to the flat rate scenario over one-year simulation periods beginning September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Estimated Percent Change in Net Interest Income Parallel Interest Rate Shock (basis points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +200 1.1 0.5 +100 0.6 0.3 -100 (0.90) (0.6) -200 (2.1) (2.1) Estimated Percent Change in Net Interest Income Yield Curve Twist Interest Rate Shock (basis points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Short End +100 (1.0) (0.5) Short End -100 0.9 (0.5) Long End +100 1.6 1.1 Long End -100 (1.8) (1.1) 
 
 The Company s NII sensitivity results at period-end were mostly little changed from the start of the year, with modest asset sensitivity in parallel shock simulations. 
 
 Yield curve twist simulations were mostly little changed from the prior year-end, with slight liability sensitivity in the short end of the yield curve and modest asset sensitivity on the long end. In the situation of a normalization of 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 the yield curve to a positive slope due to both lower short-term rates and higher long-term rates, the result is modeled to be positive to net interest income in the framework of a static balance sheet. 
 
 Economic Value of Equity (EVE) Sensitivity is conducted to ascertain a longer-term view of the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates. As with NII modeling, EVE Sensitivity captures product characteristics such as loan resets, repricing terms, maturity dates, rate caps and floors. Key assumptions include loan prepayment speeds, deposit pricing elasticity and non-maturity deposit attrition rates. These assumptions can have significant impacts on valuation results as the assumptions remain in effect for the entire life of each asset and liability. All key assumptions are subject to periodic review. 
 
 Base case EVE Sensitivity is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates. The current spot interest rate curve is shocked up and down to generate new interest rate curves for parallel rate shock scenarios. These new curves are then used to recalculate EVE Sensitivity for rate shock scenarios. 
 
 The following table sets forth the estimated percent change in the Company s EVE Sensitivity from the base case scenario, assuming various instantaneous parallel shocks in interest rates. 
 
 Estimated Percent Change in Economic Value of Equity Parallel Shock Rate Change (basis points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +200 (2.1) (3.9) +100 (0.9) (1.8) -100 0.0 1.2 -200 (0.1) 1.3 
 The Company s EVE Sensitivity profile indicates that at September 30, 2024 the balance sheet was modestly liability sensitive, with this sensitivity decreasing compared to December 31, 2023.

 PART II 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 As of September 30, 2024, neither the Company nor the Bank was involved in any pending legal proceedings believed by management to be material to the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Periodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits involving the Bank, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which the Bank holds security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans, and other issues incident to the Bank s business. A summary of certain legal matters involving unsettled litigation or pertaining to pending transactions are as follows: 
 
 On February 4, 2020, the Bank filed a complaint in the New York State Supreme Court for the County of Albany against Pioneer Bank Pioneer seeking damages of approximately 16.0 million. The complaint alleges that Pioneer is liable to the Bank for a credit loss of approximately 16.0 million suffered by the Bank in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of Pioneer s breaches of a series of loan participation agreements executed in 2017, 2018 and 2019 in which it served as the lead bank, as well as constructive fraud, fraudulent concealment and/or negligent misrepresentation. Pioneer filed a motion to dismiss aspects of the Bank s complaint, which motion was allowed in part by the court to dismiss the Bank s negligent misrepresentation claim, and denied in part by the court to allow all other claims by the Bank to proceed. The Company wrote down the underlying credit loss in its entirety in the third quarter of 2019, but recognized a partial recovery of 1.7 million early in the second quarter of 2020. The Company has not accrued for any additional anticipated recovery at this time. Extensive discovery has taken place in this action. On November 30, 2022, the Bank filed an amended complaint in its action against Pioneer setting forth more detailed allegations of Pioneer s breaches of the loan participation agreements and stating additional claims for fraudulent inducement to cause Berkshire to join the loan participation agreements, constructive fraud and fraudulent concealment. On January 30, 2023, as part of its response to the Bank s amended complaint, Pioneer filed a counterclaim against the Bank alleging (i) certain breaches by the Bank of the 2019 loan participation agreement stemming from actions that the Bank took to protect its interests after it learned of the facts and circumstances that caused the underlying credit loss, and (ii) that as a result of accepting the partial recovery of approximately 1.7 million in the second quarter of 2020 the Bank should be deemed to have ratified the 2019 loan participation agreement and mooted its claims against Pioneer. Further discovery is continuing between the parties. 
 
 On or about August 10, 2020, a former employee of the Bank s subsidiary First Choice Loan Services Inc. FCLS filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Bucks County Pennsylvania against FCLS and two of its former senior corporate officers generally alleging wrongful termination as a result of purported whistleblower retaliation and other violations of New Jersey state employment law. The complaint also purports to name the Bank and the Company as additional defendants, even though neither entity ever employed, paid wages to or contracted with the plaintiff. On November 16, 2020, the plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint reiterating the same claims against the same defendants. The Company's liability insurer has provided outside litigation counsel to defend the Company and the Bank in this matter, as well as FCLS and its former senior corporate officers. On December 7, 2020, defense counsel filed Preliminary Objections on behalf of the Company, the Bank, FCLS and FCLS s former senior corporate officers denying the plaintiff s claims and seeking dismissal of the case and an order that the plaintiff s claims must proceed through arbitration in accordance with contractual obligations set forth in plaintiff s previous employment agreement with FCLS. On June 30, 2021, the court dismissed the plaintiff s complaint without prejudice in support of FCLS s petition to compel arbitration. The parties have mutually agreed on an arbitrator to hear the case and are preparing for arbitration proceedings that are expected to occur no earlier than the first quarter of 2025. Discovery is continuing between the parties in preparation for final arbitration. 
 
 On or about May 13, 2024, a complaint was filed against the B ank in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, Syracuse Division by an individual who claims to have filed the complaint on behalf of a purported class of victims of an alleged Ponzi scheme perpetrated by a former Berkshire Bank customer. The complaint alleges that because the Bank held deposit accounts for the former customer that appear to be related to the alleged Ponzi scheme, the Bank is liable to the alleged fraudster s victims for aiding and abetting the scheme. The Bank has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b). On October 31, 2024, the court dismissed the plaintiff s complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b).
