Overview 

We
are the only publicly traded qualified opportunity fund listed on a national securities exchange. We are a Delaware limited liability
company formed on January 24, 2020. We have been treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes since our tax year ended
December 31, 2020, and we currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to meet the requirements for classification
as a partnership. We are focused on identifying, acquiring, developing or redeveloping and managing commercial real estate located within
qualified opportunity zones. At least 90 of our assets consist of qualified opportunity zone property. We qualified as a qualified opportunity
fund beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. Because we are a qualified opportunity fund certain of our investors are
eligible for favorable capital gains tax treatment on their investments. 

All
of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, one or more of our Operating Companies, either directly or
indirectly through their subsidiaries. We are externally managed by Belpointe PREP Manager, LLC (our Manager ), which is
an affiliate of our sponsor, Belpointe, LLC (our Sponsor ). 

On
May 9, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC declared effective our registration statement on Form S-11,
as amended (File No. 333-271262) (the Follow-on Registration Statement ), registering the offer and sale of up to 750,000,000

(the Dealer Manager ), a registered broker-dealer, for the sale of our Class A units through the Dealer Manager. The Dealer
Manager will enter into participating dealer agreements and wholesale agreements with other broker-dealers, referred to as selling
group members, to authorize those broker-dealers to solicit offers to purchase our Class A units. We will pay our Dealer Manager
commissions of up to 0.25 , and the selling group members commissions ranging from 0.25 to 4.50 , of the principal amount of Class A
unit sold in the Follow-on Offering. 

In
addition, the Follow-on Registration Statement constitutes a post-effective amendment to the registration statement on Form S-11, as
amended (File No. 333-255424), registering the offer and sale of our ongoing initial public offering of up to 750,000,000 of our Class

Our
Business Outlook 

Market
conditions for multifamily and mixed-use rental properties in the geographic markets in which we operate remained strong over the past
several quarters. Future economic conditions and the demand for multifamily and mixed-use rental properties in the geographic markets
in which we operate are, and the real estate industry in general is, subject to uncertainty as a result of a number of factors, including,
among others, construction delays, delays in the lease-up and stabilization of properties, unemployment rates, changes with respect to
borrowing costs as a result of interest rates and other factors, inflation, fluctuations in occupancy rates and market rents, financial
market volatility, general economic uncertainty, increasing energy costs, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. The potential
effect of these and other factors and the projected impact of these and other events on our business, results of operations and financial
performance, presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our future performance and financial results, including the potential
to negatively impact our costs of operations, our financing arrangements, the value of our investments, and the laws, regulations and
governmental and regulatory policies applicable to us. As a result, our past performance may not be indicative of future results. 

Given
the evolving nature of certain of these factors, the extent to which they may impact our future performance and financial results will
depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and, as a result, at this time we are unable to estimate the impact that
these factors may have on our future financial results. Our Manager continuously reviews our investment and financing strategies for
optimization and to reduce our risk in the face of the fluidity of these and other factors. 

Our
Investments 

As

Revenue 

Rental
Revenue 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, rental revenue increased by 0.4 million, primarily
as a result of the lease-up of certain residential units and retail spaces at Aster Links, which was placed into service during
the current year. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, rental revenue decreased by 0.2 million, primarily
due to lower below-market rent intangible amortization as certain intangible liabilities became fully amortized in the prior year, partially
offset as a result of the lease-up of certain residential units and retail spaces at Aster Links, which was placed into service
during the current year. 

22 

Expenses 

Property
Expenses 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, property expenses consisted of management fees, property operational expenses,
real estate taxes, and utilities and insurance expenses incurred in relation to our operating properties. During the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, property expenses increased by 1.1 million and 1.7 million, respectively.
This increase is primarily due to the property expenses incurred at Aster Links, which was placed into service during the current
year. 

General
and Administrative 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of employee cost
sharing expenses (pursuant to our management agreement and employee and cost sharing agreement), marketing expenses, legal, audit, tax
and accounting fees. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, general and administrative
expenses decreased by 0.6 million and 0.8 million, respectively. This decrease is primarily due to lower marketing expenses, and dead
deal costs recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Interest
Expense 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense totaled 3.3 million and zero, respectively, due to gross interest
expense of 4.5 million and 0.2 million, respectively, and the impact of non-cash amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs
of 0.7 million and 0.4 million, respectively, partially offset by capitalized interest and fees of 1.9 million and 0.6 million, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense totaled 5.8 million and zero, respectively, due to gross interest
expense of 8.8 million and 0.2 million, respectively, and the impact of non-cash amortization of debt discount and debt issuance
costs of 1.5 million and 0.4 million, respectively, partially offset by capitalized interest and fees of 4.5 million and 0.6
million, respectively. Please see Note 7 Debt in our consolidated financial statements
in this Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our debt arrangements. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, depreciation and amortization increased by
 1.0 million and 0.7 million, respectively. This increase is primarily attributable to the impact of placing certain fixed assets into
service at Aster Links during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by lower in-place lease intangible
amortization as certain intangible assets became fully amortized in 2023. 

Impairment
of Real Estate 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded impairment charges of zero and 0.8 million, respectively. During the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded impairment charges of 0.8 million and 3.0 million, respectively. The impairment
charges recorded were in relation to one of our real estate assets located in Nashville, Tennessee, based on our conclusion that the
estimated fair market value of the real estate asset was lower than the carrying value, and as a result, we reduced the carrying value
to the estimated fair market value. 

Other
income 

Interest
Income 

Interest
income for the periods presented were comprised of interest earned from cash balances held in interest bearing bank accounts. The increase
in the current year periods as compared to the prior year periods were attributable to higher cash balances in interest bearing accounts. 

Other
(expense) income 

Other
(expense) income for the periods presented were primarily comprised of gains and losses in connection with our interest rate caps. Please
see Note 9 Derivative Instruments in our consolidated financial statements in this Form
10-Q for additional information.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

Our
primary needs for liquidity and capital resources are to fund our investments, including construction and development costs, pay our
Public Offering and operating fees and expenses, pay any distributions that we may make to the holders of our units and pay interest
on our outstanding indebtedness. 

Our
Public Offering and operating fees and expenses include, among other things, legal, audit and valuation fees and expenses, federal and
state filing fees, SEC, FINRA and NYSE filing fees, printing expenses, administrative fees, transfer agent fees, marketing and distribution
fees, the management fee that we pay to our Manager, and fees and expenses related to acquiring, financing, appraising, and managing
our commercial real estate properties. We do not have office or personnel expenses as we do not have any employees. 

Liquidity 

Our
future needs for liquidity will depend on a variety of factors, including, without limitation, our ability to generate cash flows
from operations, the timing and availability of net proceeds from our Public Offerings and any future offerings that we may conduct,
the timing and extent of our real estate acquisition and disposition activities, and the timing and extent of our construction and
development costs. 

Economic
uncertainty, fluctuating interest rates, volatility in the real estate markets, slowdowns in transaction volume, delays in financings
from banks and other lenders and other negative trends may, in the future, adversely impact our ability to timely access potential sources
of liquidity. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or on terms that are acceptable to us, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

We believe that our cash on-hand, the anticipated net proceeds from our
Public Offerings, the projected cash flows from our real estate assets and our current and anticipated financing activities will be sufficient
to meet our liquidity and capital resource requirements for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Form 10-Q. 

Capital
Requirements and Resources 

Where
our Manager and its affiliates, including our Sponsor, have funded, and in the future if they continue to fund, our capital requirements
by advancing us offering and operating fees and expenses, we reimburse our Manager and its affiliates, including our Sponsor, pursuant
to the terms of our management agreement and employee and cost sharing agreement. Fees payable and expenses reimbursable to our Manager
and its affiliates, including our Sponsor, may be paid, at the election of the recipient, in cash, by issuance of our Class A Units at
the then-current NAV, or through some combination of the foregoing. There were no Public Offering costs incurred by our Manager and its
affiliates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Manager
and its affiliates, including our Sponsor, incurred operating expenses of 0.5 million and 0.4 million, respectively, on our behalf.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Manager and its affiliates, including our Sponsor, incurred operating expenses
of 1.7 million and 1.7 million, respectively, on our behalf. 

During

terms and conditions that are customary for a project of this type and will be subject to guaranteed maximum price. As of September 30,
2024, we had an unfunded capital commitment totaling 17.8 million under the terms of this agreement as well as other construction related
commitments for the development of Aster Links. As of the date of this Form 10-Q, we currently anticipate that the remaining funding for
construction and soft costs associated with the development of Aster Links will be a minimum of 37.8 million (inclusive of the aforementioned
unfunded capital commitment). 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, our indirect majority-owned subsidiary entered into a variable-rate construction loan agreement for

1991 Main Mezzanine Loan, we are required to maintain an interest reserve and carry reserve for purposes of paying accrued but unpaid
interest on the 1991 Main Mezzanine Loan and interest, principal and other obligations under the 1991 Main Construction Loan. As of September
30, 2024, the 1991 Main Mezzanine Loan balance was 44.7 million. Proceeds under the 1991 Main Mezzanine Loan may be used to reimburse
the Company for certain costs and expenses incurred in relation to, and to fund the continued development of, Aster Links. The 1991 Main
Mezzanine Loan has an initial maturity date of May 12, 2027 and contains a one-year extension option, subject to certain restrictions.

agreement contains terms and conditions that are customary for a project of this type and will be subject to guaranteed maximum price.
As of September 30, 2024, we had an unfunded capital commitment of 66.0 million under the terms of this agreement. We currently anticipate
the remaining funding for construction and soft costs associated with the development of Viv will be a minimum of approximately
 84.8 million (inclusive of the aforementioned unfunded capital commitment).

be used to fund the development of Viv. The 1000 First Construction Loan has an initial maturity date of June 28, 2027 and contains
two one-year extension options, subject to certain restrictions. For additional details regarding the 1000 First Construction Loan, see
 Our Investments 1000 First Avenue North and 900 First Avenue North St. Petersburg, Florida Viv . As of September 30, 2024, we have drawn down 12.1 million on the 1000 First Construction Loan.

due to mature on June 26, 2025, with two six-month extension options, subject to certain restrictions. For additional details regarding
the 900 8th Land Loan, see Our Investments 900 8th Avenue South Nashville, Tennessee. 

We
expect to continue to obtain the capital resources that we need over the short and long-term from cash on-hand, from the proceeds of
our Public Offerings and any future offerings that we may conduct, from the advancement of reimbursable fees and expenses by our Manager
and its affiliates, including our Sponsor, from the proceeds of secured or unsecured financing from banks and other lenders, from projected
operating funds from our real estate assets and from any other undistributed cash flow generated from operations. For additional details
regarding our Public Offerings, see Overview and Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Use of Proceeds from Registered Sales of Securities . 

Leverage 

We
employ leverage in order to provide more funds available for investment. We believe that careful use of conservatively structured leverage
will help us to achieve our diversification goals and potentially enhance the returns on our investments. 

Our
targeted aggregate property-level leverage, excluding any debt at the Company level or on assets under development or redevelopment,
after we have acquired a substantial portfolio of stabilized commercial real estate, is between 50-70 of the greater of the cost (before
deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) or fair market value of our assets. During the period when we are acquiring, developing
and redeveloping our investments, we may employ greater leverage on individual assets. An example of property-level leverage is a mortgage
loan secured by an individual property or portfolio of properties incurred or assumed in connection with our acquisition of such property
or portfolio of properties. An example of debt at the Company level is a line of credit obtained by us or our Operating Companies. 

Our
Manager may from time to time modify our leverage policy in its discretion in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs
of debt and equity capital, market values of our assets, general conditions in the market for debt and equity securities, growth and
acquisition opportunities or other factors. There is no limit on the amount we may borrow with respect to any individual property or
portfolio.

agreements and wholesale agreements with other broker-dealers, referred to as selling group members, to authorize
those broker-dealers to solicit offers to purchase our Class A units. We will pay our Dealer Manager commissions of up to 0.25 , and
the selling group members commissions ranging from 0.25 to 4.50 , of the principal amount of a Class A unit sold in the Public
Offerings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have sold aggregate gross proceeds of 1,000,000 and
 1,711,020, respectively, of Class A units in connection with our Public Offerings. 

28 

The
purchase price for Class A units in our Public Offerings will be the lesser of (i) the current NAV of our Class A units, and (ii) the
average of the high and low sale prices of our Class A units on the NYSE during regular trading hours on the last trading day immediately
preceding the investment date on which the NYSE was open for trading and trading in our Class A units occurred. As of June 30, 2024 the
assumed NAV of our Class A units was equal to 98.24 per Class A unit. Our Manager will calculate our NAV within approximately 60 days
of the last day of each quarter and any adjustments will take effect as of the first business day following its public announcement. 

We
will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC disclosing quarterly determinations of our NAV per Class A unit. Additionally, if a material
event occurs in between quarterly updates of NAV that would cause our NAV to change by 10 or more from the most recently disclosed NAV,
we will disclose the updated price and the reason for the change in prospectus supplement as promptly as reasonably practicable. 

From
the period of October 7, 2021, the date of the first closing held in connection with our Primary Offering, through December 31, 2023,
we issued 2,372,289 Class A units in our Primary Offering, raising net offering proceeds of 233.5 million. During the nine months ended
months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 24,694 Class A units, raising aggregate gross proceeds of 1,711,020, in connection with our Public Offerings. Together with the gross proceeds
raised in prior offerings by our predecessor in interest, Belpointe REIT, Inc., as of September 30, 2024, we have raised aggregate gross
offering cash proceeds of 356.0 million. 

The
following tables summarize certain information about the proceeds of our Public Offerings and our use of those proceeds, including direct
or indirect payments to our directors, officers, affiliates or to any person owning 10 or more of any class of our equity securities
