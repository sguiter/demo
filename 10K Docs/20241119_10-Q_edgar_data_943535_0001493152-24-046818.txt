C. Financial
 position 

The
Group is subject to certain inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of its business. To date, substantially all the Company s
efforts and investments have been devoted to the growth of its business, organically and inorganically. These investments have historically
been funded by raising outside capital, and as a result of these efforts, the Company has generally incurred significant losses and used
net cash outflows from operations since inception. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of thousands and used net cash flows in its operations
of thousands. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of thousands available to fund
its operations, and an accumulated deficit of thousands. 

The
Group s management expects that the Group will continue to generate losses and negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable
future. Based on the projected cash flows and cash balances as of September 30, 2024, management currently is of the opinion that its
existing cash will be sufficient to fund operations until the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result, there is substantial doubt
regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management
endeavors to secure sufficient financing through the sale of additional equity securities or capital inflows from strategic partnerships.
Additional funds may not be available when the Company needs them, on favorable terms, or at all. If the Company is unsuccessful in securing
sufficient financing, it may need to cease operations. 

The
financial statements do not include adjustments for measurement or presentation of assets and liabilities, which may be required should
the Company fail to operate as a going concern. 

D. Risk
 factors 

The
Group faces a number of risks, including uncertainties regarding finalization of the development process, demand and market acceptance
of the Group s products, the effects of technological changes, competition and the development of products by competitors. Additionally,
other risk factors also exist, such as the ability to manage growth and the effect of planned expansion of operations on the Group s
future results. In addition, the Group expects to continue incurring significant operating costs and losses in connection with the development
of its products and increased marketing efforts. As mentioned above, the Group has not yet generated significant revenues from its operations
to fund its activities, and therefore the continuance of its activities as a going concern depends on the receipt of additional funding
from its current stockholders and investors or from third parties. 

E. On
 October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip
 and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive
 rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s
 border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted
 in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians and soldiers. Following the attack,
 Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against
 these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror
 attacks. Following the attack by Hamas on Israel s southern border, Hezbollah in Lebanon
 also launched missile, rocket, drone and shooting attacks against Israeli military sites,
 troops and Israeli towns in northern Israel. In addition, Iran recently launched direct attacks
 on Israel and has threatened to continue to attack Israel. Iran is also believed to have
 a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah
 in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. While
 currently limited damage was registered in Israel from the Iranian attacks, the situation
 is developing and could lead to additional wars and hostilities in the Middle East. In October
 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. It is possible
 that the hostilities with Hezbollah will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations,
 including Palestinian military organizations in the West Bank, as well as other hostile countries,
 will join the hostilities. Such hostilities may include terror and missile attacks.

NOTE
1 GENERAL (continued) 

Certain
of our consultants in Israel may be called up for reserve duty, in addition to employees of our service providers located in Israel,
have been called, for service and such persons may be absent for an extended period of time. In the event that hostilities disrupt our
ongoing operations, our ability to deliver or provide services in a timely manner to meet our contractual obligations towards customers
and vendors could be materially and adversely affected. 

The
intensity and duration of Israel s current war against Hamas is difficult to predict, as are such war s economic implications
on the Company s business and operations and on Israel s economy in general. These events may be intertwined with wider macroeconomic
indications of a deterioration of Israel s economic standing, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability
to effectively conduct its operations. 

Since
this is an event that is not under the control of the Company, and matters such as the fighting continuing or stopping may affect the
Company s assessments, as at the reporting date the Company is unable to assess the extent of the effect of the war on its business
activities and on the business activities of its subsidiaries, and on their medium and long term results. The Company is continuing to
regularly follow developments on the matter and is examining the effects on its operations and the value of its assets.

 of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company following such issuance. Under the terms of the IHQ Agreement, IHQ also
 undertook to provide professional consulting services to enable the Company to implement, develop and commercialize its own and

modules to introduce to the market novel products in the cybersecurity field applicable to both the business and individual level. 

The
IHQ Agreement provides that the Consideration Shares are subject to a Lock Up Agreement for a period of 12 months from the date of their
issuance, but the lock up would be automatically canceled on the date of the Uplisting (as defined below). In addition, the lock up may
be cancelled unilaterally by IHQ, in its sole discretion, in which case the Perpetual License will be considered fully paid. Under the
terms of the IHQ Agreement, the Company undertook to complete an uplisting (the Uplisting of its shares of Common Stock
on NYSE, NASDAQ or the Chicago Board Options Exchange prior to June 28, 2025 (the Uplisting Target Date ).

NOTES
TO CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Under
the terms of the IHQ Agreement, the Company may at any time prior to the Uplisting Target Date, at its sole discretion without any obligation
whatsoever, pay IHQ in cash million dollar as a license fee for the Perpetual License, upon which the entirety of the Consideration
Shares shall be returned to the Company. If the Uplisting occurs on or before the Uplisting Target Date, then upon Uplisting the Perpetual
License shall be deemed to have been fully paid for by the issuance of the Consideration Shares, and all of IHQ s rights of termination
of the Agreement and rights related to cancellation of Lock Up shall terminate and no longer be in force and effect. However, . 

In
the event that the Company or a subsidiary will raise funds on or prior to December 28, 2025 (the Target Fundraise Period in connection with, from or relating to the Uplisting (whether or not the Uplisting ultimately occurs) for a specified amount (the Target
Fundraise ), the Company is obligated to pay IHQ a marketing advisory fee at a specified the rate for each dollar cumulatively
raised during the Target Fundraise Period over and above the Target Fundraise. 

The
Company estimated the value of the Perpetual License purchased at 
based on the fair value of Company s shares at the agreement date. In addition, the Company determined that in certain circumstances, beyond its control, the Consideration Shares may
be obligated to be redeemed and therefore, classified the Consideration Shares as temporary equity pursuant to the guidance in ASC 815-40-25.

Combined
WHEN Product Offerings 

Our
product offerings are comprised of three complementary segments, namely 

1. 
 Cyber
 Care, which is the long standing and core business segment of WHEN 

2. 
 AI
 based image processing systems such as audio-video systems and security cameras solutions being an off-line extension of the
 on-line Cyber Care services entered through the acquisition of 26 shares in Instaview 

3. 
 Mobile
 telecom GSM which is a new business segment, linking the off and on line business segments entered through the recent acquisition
 of CrossMobile 

All
three are targeting commercial enterprises (B2B) and individual users (B2C). 

Cyber
Care 

B2B
Offerings Our B2B Cybersecurity system software development and implementation program focuses on developing a threat management
software that provides innovative solutions for the constantly evolving cyber challenges of businesses, non-governmental organizations
(NGO s) and governmental entities. 

In
2021 we launched OTOGRAPH, our comprehensive cybersecurity and information security system, to enable business enterprises to monitor,
analyze and prevent suspicious or harmful behavior on corporate networks and connected devices. The OTOGRAPH is designed to analyze and
prevent internal or external abuse or abnormal activity on enterprise devices, such as PCs, mobile phones, servers or any other operating
system (OS)-based Internet of things (IOT) devices. IoT devices are the nonstandard computing devices that connect wirelessly to a network
and have the ability to transmit data. 

The
rapid transition to open and cloud-based remote workforce has exposed businesses and organizations across the world to higher risks of
cyber-attacks and information security breaches. To enable businesses to better protect their data and workflow, we developed a Business
Behavioral Analysis (BBA) system that enables business leaders to track all activity from any given location on a one-stop dashboard.
Developed over the past two years, OTOGRAPH provides aggregated data and a wide variety of real-time analytics such as real time monitoring
of online behavior, applications and system behavior, data breaches, internal and external connections analytics, productivity analysis
and psycholinguistic analysis. Corporations and organizations can then use the dashboard to detect suspicious human or device activities
that put their company at risk. 

OTOGRAPH
was developed based on based on a state of the art intelligence technology combined with AI technology that processes and analyzes massive
amounts of behavioral and communication data and enables organizations to make real time accurate preventive assessments and decisions
to protect company assets and ensure operational efficiency. OTOGRAPH deploys a unique Business Behavioral Analysis (BBA) machine learning
software. Behavioral digital data is extracted from all endpoint devices that are connected to the company s network infrastructure
 whether physically, wirelessly or remotely. The data is processed and analyzed to learn and to reveal the unique digital behavioral
pattern of the organization as a whole and of every endpoint or individual. 

OTOGRAPH
then sets baselines of normal patterns for each, and constantly searches for anomalies deviations from those expected patterns.
The anomalies are detected automatically and instantly, categorized by their type and generate push alerts which are sent to the business
leader s dashboard and enabling him to respond to the threat. 

OTOGRAPH
is continuously learning and calibrating the normal patterns and their thresholds to minimize the number of false alarms and constantly
adapt to the changing needs of organizations in real time. Our B2C Cybersecurity division targets families concerned with external cyber
threats and exposures in addition to monitoring a child s behavioral patterns that may alert parents to potential tragedies caused
by cyber bullying, pedophiles, other predators, and depression. 

20 

B2C 

SG s
Parental System offers a comprehensive solution which is designed to enable parents wishing to observe their children s online
behavior to learn if they are accessing inappropriate websites and content and/or to protect them from a range of threats including cyberbullying,
pedophiles and other predators and identity theft. 

The
Parental System line is positioned as the ultimate parental cyber solution . This system incorporates a range of features
enabling parents to view and manage their children s Android phones and devices. The key elements of our proprietary solutions
include the following: analysis of all incoming and outgoing written data; analysis of all incoming and outgoing audio communication;
real time location tracking; environmental surroundings analysis; and cyber activity analysis. 

The
Parental System has similar features to those of the B2B yet tailored to fit the needs of parents and guardians to protect their children.
Such variations focus on online behavioral patterns whether vocally, via short message service SMS or social media platforms.
If there is a change in behavior patterns, the product is designed to immediately send the parent or adult guardian an alert. For example,
as stated in several international reports, one of the identifiable indicators before suicide is social withdrawal, something which today
appears as a significant decrease in text message exchanges. The system categorizes this decrease as a red flag. Moreover, there are
certain words and phrases which increase in use prior to suicide which the system will detect these it will put them in the red flag
category. 

https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/teen-suicide/art-20044308 

While
analyzing voice calls based on; tone of speech, lengths of the conversation and the frequency of calls, Parental System Analytics is
capable of identifying changes in behavioral patterns and flagging these changes. For example, studies showed that with deteriorating
mental health, the frequency of calls decreases and the sentences along with the length of the conversations get shorter. Any such discrepancy
in behavior patterns will send a real time alert to the parent or legal guardian, potentially avoiding a tragedy. 

Strategy
Cyber Care: We believe that the technology underlying our product offering is our primary competitive advantage. The strength of
our solution is driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed, coupled with how we have combined
them into our highly versatile platform incl. the mobile telecom platform discussed below. These advantages enable our end users to 

Prevent
 trade secret and data leakage; 

Protect
 against hackers; 

Minimize
 loss of productivity; 

Detect
 embezzlements and thefts; 

Defend
 employees from harassments; 

Prevent
 talent and client poaching; 

Avoid
 human errors; 

Develop
 a new level of decision-making ability based on accurate and real-time data; and 

Assist
 parents and legal guardians in monitoring their minor children s cyber online activities. 

The
Company s go-to-market strategy focuses principally on generating revenue from software, services and licensing. The Company intends
to drive revenue growth and to achieve margins that are consistent with those of other enterprise software companies. 

We
currently intend to sell substantially all of our products and services to distributors and resellers, which will sell to end-user customers,
which we refer to in this report as our customers. 

21 

The
implementation of our strategies is subject to our raising significant cash resources, of which no assurance can be provided that we
will be successful in raising the needed capital on commercially reasonable terms. As of the date of this prospectus, we have no commitments
for any capital raise. 

Mobile
telecom GSM 

Following
the first step, our next planned strategy is to add the advanced B2B and B2B Cyber Care bundled with the audio-video systems and security
cameras solution and offer them as an integrated part of our GSM solutions. This will give our B2B the possibility to use the AI and
BBA as a tool to increase not only security but as well efficiency in sales organizations where soft skills, emotions and personal relations
are crucial. 

In
respect to the B2C market our strategy is to give families a tool to protect their assets and entire households in particular kids or
pets and evenelderly members being fragile newcomers in the world of e-commerce, on-line banking and on-line dating. 

The
third step expected to be initiated in fourth quarter of 2024 is to copy and paste the same scenario of combining Cyber Care and Mobile
Telecom to other selected markets in North Africa, the USA and Europe. 

Bundled
Security Offering 

Under
the agreement with Terra Zone, WHEN and Tera Zone intend to bring to market an endpoint security solution intended to enable organizations
to precisely identify and isolate any entity whether working remotely or within the corporate network ensuring that only
authorized users can access critical resources while remaining completely isolated from the broader network.

Income (expenses), Net . Financing income, net amounted to 28,431 as compare to financing expenses of 6,908 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in financing income, net is mainly a result of currency exchange differences between the Dollar
and the New Israeli Shekel. 

Net
Loss . As a result of the foregoing, our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1,046,513 compared to 1,527,128
for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Revenues 

Our
total revenue consists of sales of our products and services. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
current operating expenses consist of three components - research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses and general
and administrative expenses. 

Research
and Development Expenses, net 

We
expect to continue incurring substantial expenses for the next several years as we continue to develop our product lines. We are unable,
with any certainty, to estimate either the costs or the timelines in which those expenses will be incurred. The design and development
activities will consume a large proportion of our current, as well as projected, resources. 

Our
research and development costs include costs are comprised of: 

internal recurring costs, such as personnel-related costs (salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation and other costs), materials
and supplies, facilities and maintenance costs attributable to research and development functions; and 

fees paid to external parties who provide us with contract services, such as preclinical testing, manufacturing and related testing and
clinical trial activities.

the acquisition of Cross Mobile and our efforts to be in the air with standard packages of Voice, SMS and Data in Poland and International
Roaming and initiate cooperation with existing or build new Telecom operators. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, professional services, rent and office maintenance and
other non-personnel related expenses.

Revenues 

Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 123,173 and 162,784, respectively. The decrease in our revenues resulted
primarily from one-time services provided under a development agreement in an amount of 90,000 recognized during the six months ended
June 30, 2023 partially offset by increase in sale of products in Israel. 

Research
and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, share-based compensation expenses,
consulting fees, service providers costs and overhead expenses. Research and development expenses decreased from 1,433,087 during
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,280,767 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease resulted primarily
from decrease in non-cash share-based compensation expenses partially offset by increase in professional services, salaries and related
expenses and in rent and office maintenance. 

Selling
and Marketing Expenses . Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of professional fees. Selling and marketing expenses for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 140,504 as compared to 30,197 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase is primarily attributable to increase in salaries and related expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, share-based
compensation expenses and other non-personnel related expenses such as legal expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased
from 4,245,311 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2,232,494 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease
is primarily attributed to the decrease in non-cash share-based compensation expenses. 

Financing
Income (expenses), Net . Financing income, net increased from 8,595 of financing income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
to financing income, net of 20,846 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in financing income, net is mainly a result
of currency exchange differences between the Dollar and the New Israeli Shekel. 

Net
Loss . As a result of the foregoing, our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3,596,278 compared to 5,543,908
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024
and 2023, we had current assets of 388,217 and 250,894, respectively, and total assets of 16,242,118 and 10,198,927 respectively.
We had current liabilities of 1,116,355 and 718,137 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and total liabilities of 4,670,981
as compared to 3,869,960 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 we had 5,000,000 of redeemable shares. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 59,671 compared to the cash balance of 46,435 as of September 30, 2023. We have no
cash equivalents. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a negative working capital of 728,138 as compared with a working capital deficiency of 424,790 at September
30, 2023. 

Financial
Support 

In
November 2022, we entered into an investment agreement with George Baumeohl, our director, pursuant to which Mr. Baumeohl has agreed
to support our operation by way of an equity investment of up to 3 million as needed. The agreement provides for sales of our common
stock to Mr. Baumeohl at per share purchase prices ranging between 0.0003 and 0.0005. As of the date of this report, we received an
aggregate of 2,164,767 from Mr. Baumeohl. 

The
Company and Mr. Baumeohl entered into an agreement as of August 14, 2024 pursuant to which all investments by Mr. Baumeohl during 2024
under the November 2022 investment agreement will be priced at a per share purchase price of 0.0001, retroactive to January 1, 2024. 

Management
believes that funds on hand, not including the subscription proceeds that we are entitled to receive on a periodic basis under the
committed subscription agreement with our director, will enable us to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements
through December 2024. We are substantially dependent on the periodic investment by our director the committed subscription
agreement and any disruption of this arrangement will likely materially adversely affect our business. 

We
may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of private or public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional
capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third
parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights, future revenue streams, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that
may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through private or public equity offerings, the ownership interest of our
existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely
affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America GAAP ). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements
of operations. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates. 

While
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Not

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. As disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at December 31, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The limitation
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting was due to the applied risk-based approach which is indicative of many
small companies with limited number of staff in corporate functions. The identified weakness were: 

Material
 Weakness We did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we (i) lacked
 a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate
 with our financial reporting requirements and (ii) we lacked controls over the disclosure of our business operations. 

lack
 of segregation of duties Significant Deficiencies Inadequate segregation of duties. 

We
expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future which
we believe will mitigate the impact of the material weaknesses discussed above. Until such time as we have a chief financial officer
with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP and establish an audit committee and implement internal controls and procedures, there are
no assurances that the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in
errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. 

Except
for the material weakness noted above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
October 27, 2020 WHEN filed suit in State Court, Palm Beach County, Florida, against FSC Solutions, Inc. FSC ), Eli Gal
Levy EL and Padem Consultants Sprl (collectively, the Defendants ). The suit relates to the Stock Purchase
Agreement entered into by WHEN with FSC and its shareholders, which included EL, pursuant to which WHEN acquired all of the issued and
outstanding stock of FSC in exchange for the issuance of 70 billion shares of WHEN unregistered common stock. FSC was the putative owner
of a software and trading platform which WHEN intended to use to enter into the on-line trading business. Subsequent to the completion
of the acquisition, we determined that FSC did not have control over the trading platform and software we expected to acquire and operate.
The suit seeks declaratory judgment to unwind the FSC transaction and cancel the shares of WHEN common stock issued in the FSC transaction
that are still outstanding. 

On
or about, January 19, 2022, EL filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to remove the restrictive legend from all the
shares of Common Stock held by EL (the 2022 Lawsuit ), which are approximately 23,000,000,000 shares. The Company is vigorously
defending the 2022 Lawsuit, which is currently in the discovery. Trial is scheduled for May 5, 2025. 

On
June 24, 2022 the Company filed an amended complaint in Palm Beach County, Florida (CASE NO. 50-2020- CA-011735), alleging violation
of Fla. Stat. 517.301, seeking declaratory relief with regard to the status of the shares held and transferred by EL, and seeking a temporary
injunction with regard to the transfer of any subject shares. 

The
Florida Court dismissed the amended complaint based on the statute of limitations. 

The
Company intends to continue to vigorously pursue this action and avail itself of all options lawfully available to it. 

From
time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may
harm our business. We are not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims against us. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

In
addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed
in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

On
November 1, 2022, we entered into an investment agreement with George Baumeohl, Company s director, pursuant to which Mr. Baumeohl
has agreed to support Company s operation by way of an equity investment of up to 3 million, as needed. 

a. 
 On
 August 11, 2024 and October 9, 2024, the Company received subscription proceeds of 150,000 and 20,000, respectively, under the
 investment agreement with Mr. Baumeohl in respect of which he is entitled to 1,700,000,000 shares of Common Stock which have not
 been issued as of the date of this report. 

We
relied upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act by virtue
