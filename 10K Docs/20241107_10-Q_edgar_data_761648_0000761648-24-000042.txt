 Litigation 
 The Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, including, but not limited to commercial disputes. The Company believes that such litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or its results of operations. The Company records a liability when it considers the loss probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the below legal proceedings are in process: 
 On March 2, 2022, the Company entered into definitive agreements for the Company's merger with WHLR (the "Merger") and other series of related all-cash transactions providing for the sale of the Company and its assets (collectively, the "Transactions"). On April 8, 2022, several purported holders of the Company's outstanding preferred stock filed a putative class action complaint against the Company, the Board of Directors prior to the Merger, and WHLR in Montgomery County Circuit Court, Maryland entitled Sydney, et al. v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al. , (Case No. C-15-CV-22-001527). 
 On May 6, 2022, the Plaintiffs in Sydney filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Also on May, 6, 2022, a purported holder of the Company's outstanding preferred stock filed a separate putative class action complaint against the Company and the Board of Directors prior to the Merger in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, entitled Kim v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al. , Civil Action No. 22-cv-01103. On May 11, 2022, the Company, the former Board of Directors of the Company and WHLR removed the Sydney action to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case No. 8:22-cv-01142-GLR. On May 16, 2022, the court ordered that a hearing on the Sydney Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction be held on June 22, 2022. On June 2, 2022, the Plaintiffs in Kim also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court consolidated the motions for preliminary injunction. 
 On June 23, 2022, following a hearing, the court issued an order denying both motions for preliminary injunction, holding that the Plaintiffs in both cases were unlikely to succeed on the merits and that Plaintiffs had not established that they would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was denied. 
 By order dated July 11, 2022, the court consolidated the Sydney and Kim cases and set an August 24, 2022 deadline for the Plaintiffs in both cases to file a consolidated amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on August 24, 2022. The amended complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of holders of the Company's preferred stock, among other things, claims for breach of contract against the Company and the former Board of Directors with respect to the articles supplementary governing the

 Executive Summary 
 The Company is a fully-integrated real estate investment trust that focuses on owning and operating income producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored shopping centers primarily in the Northeast, and is a subsidiary of WHLR. At September 30, 2024, the Company owned a portfolio of 17 properties. 
 The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to leases. The Company's operating results therefore depend on the ability of its tenants to make the payments required by the terms of their leases. The Company primarily focuses its investment activities on grocery-anchored shopping centers. The Company believes that, because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at such centers, its type of "necessities-based" properties should provide relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. 
 Significant Circumstances and Transactions 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On February 29, 2024, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement. The interest rate under the Revolving Credit Agreement was the daily SOFR, plus applicable margins of 0.10 plus 2.75 .

The Revolving Credit Agreement was collateralized by 6 properties, consisting of Carll's Corner, Fieldstone Marketplace, Oakland Commons, Kings Plaza, Oregon Avenue and South Philadelphia, and proceeds were used for capital expenditures and tenant improvements for such properties. Upon the disposition of Kings Plaza, the outstanding borrowings were repaid and the Revolving Credit Agreement was closed on September 12, 2024. 
 Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement 
 On March 28, 2024, the Company received 1.0 million of 2.5 million in deferred loan proceeds under the Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement following the Company's satisfaction of certain lease-related contingencies.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, real estate investments and purchase accounting allocations related thereto, and asset impairment. Management's estimates are based both on information that is currently available and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions. 
 The Company believes there have been no material changes to the items disclosed as its critical accounting policies under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for recently-adopted accounting pronouncements.

 Same-Property Net Operating Income 
 Same-property net operating income ("Same-Property NOI") is a widely-used non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes, when considered with financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors. The Company defines Same-Property NOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because Same-Property NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs and impairment charges, it provides a performance measure, that when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company uses Same-Property NOI to evaluate its operating performance since Same-Property NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. Properties are included in Same-Property NOI if they are owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared. Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under GAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are excluded from Same-Property NOI. 
 The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is consolidated operating income. Same-Property NOI should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated operating income prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. Further, Same-Property NOI is a measure for which there is no standard industry definition and, as such, it is not consistently defined or reported on among the Company's peers, and thus may not provide an adequate basis for comparison among REITs. 
 The following table reconciles Same-Property NOI to the Company's consolidated operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure): 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating income 2,824,000 4,942,000 7,654,000 7,744,000 Add (deduct): Corporate general and administrative 499,000 679,000 1,692,000 2,349,000 Gain on sales, net (1,703,000) (2,662,000) (1,648,000) (2,662,000) Impairment charges 1,064,000 1,064,000 Depreciation and amortization 2,272,000 2,738,000 6,487,000 8,540,000 Straight-line rents (127,000) (299,000) (194,000) (819,000) Above (below) market lease amortization, net (45,000) (105,000) (181,000) (233,000) Other non-property revenue (5,000) (7,000) (17,000) (46,000) NOI related to properties not defined as same-property (430,000) (451,000) (1,351,000) (1,406,000) Same-Property NOI 4,349,000 4,835,000 13,506,000 13,467,000 Number of same properties 17 17 17 17 Same-property occupancy, end of period 86.3 84.8 86.3 84.8 Same-property leased, end of period 89.7 87.6 89.7 87.6 Same-property average base rent, end of period 10.78 10.85 10.78 10.85 
 Same-Property NOI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 10.1 and increased 0.3 , respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to (1) an increased bad debt provision, in part due to the Big Lots bankruptcy (2) increased one-time property operating expenses, which was partially offset by (3) an increase of 150 basis points in occupancy. The increase for the nine months ended

 Big Lots Chapter 11 Bankruptcy 
 On September 9, 2024, Big Lots, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, "Big Lots"), filed for protection under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Big Lots leased two locations from us (collectively, the "Big Lots Leases"). At September 30, 2024, the Big Lots Leases consist of 65,051 square feet and constitute approximately 0.53 of our portfolio's annualized base rent in the aggregate. At September 30, 2024, amounts due from Big Lots were approximately 0.1 million, of which approximately 0.1 million were reserved for within our allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables. 
 Big Lots is entitled to certain rights under the Bankruptcy Code regarding the assumption or rejection of its leases, including the Big Lots Leases. We are currently negotiating with Big Lots on potential modifications to the Big Lots Leases, which may be assumed and assigned as part of the currently pending or other sale of its business. There can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful and which Big Lots Leases, if any, will be assumed by Big Lots and assigned to a purchaser of its business. If successful,

Table of Contents 

 any such modifications would not occur unless a sale of Big Lots business is agreed, the Bankruptcy Court approves the sale, and the sale closes. Any Big Lots Leases not assumed by Big Lots will likely be rejected, which would entitle us to a rejection damages claim. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company funds operating expenses and other liquidity requirements, including debt service and loan maturities, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions, primarily from its operations, asset sales and the 24.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not have any scheduled debt maturities for the twelve months ending September 30, 2025. The Company is working to increase revenue by improving occupancy, which includes backfilling vacant anchor spaces and replacing defaulted tenants. Tenant improvements and leasing commissions for these efforts will be partially funded by restricted cash, strategic disposition of assets and financing of properties. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 77,075 shares of Series C Preferred Stock under the Repurchase Program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1.0 million. On September 25, 2024, the Company launched a Tender Offer to purchase up to an aggregate of 9.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock. Following the expiration of its Tender Offer on October 24, 2024, the Company accepted for purchase all of the 688,670 shares of Series C Preferred Stock that were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or below the 14.00 per share purchase price for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 9.6 million. These repurchases of the Company's Preferred Stock were funded by asset sales. 
 The Company has 1.5 million outstanding construction commitments at September 30, 2024. 
 In order to continue qualifying as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its "REIT taxable income," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Company paid preferred stock dividends through the third quarter of 2024 and has continued to declare preferred stock dividends through the fourth quarter of 2024. Future dividend declarations will continue to be at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will depend on the cash flow and financial condition of the Company, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company intends to continue to operate its business in a manner that will allow it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax requirements. 
 
 Net Cash Flows 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 5,755,000 4,925,000 Investing activities 9,436,000 (335,000) Financing activities (7,043,000) 582,000 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash flows provided by investing activities were primarily the result of net proceeds received from the sale of real estate, partially offset by the Company's expenditures for property improvements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 13.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of Kings Plaza and 5.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of Oakland Commons, partially offset by 10.0 million of expenditures incurred for property improvements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred 3.1 million of expenditures for property improvements, which was partially offset by net proceeds received of 2.8 million from the sale of the outparcel building adjacent to Carll's Corner. These increases in expenditures are a result of increased leasing activity. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid 8.1 million of preferred stock dividends, paid down borrowings of 5.2 million under the Revolving Credit Agreement, repurchased 1.0 million of preferred stock and paid 0.4 million of deferred financing costs, which was partially offset by 5.2 million in proceeds received from the Revolving Credit Agreement and 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 2.5 million in proceeds received related to the Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received 9.06 million of proceeds from the 11.56 million Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement, which was partially offset by 8.1 million of preferred stock dividends and 0.4 million of deferred financing costs made by the Company. 
 
 Funds From Operations 
 We use funds from operations ("FFO"), a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and December 2018). As defined by Nareit, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan origination costs), plus impairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a valuable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating results. 
 We believe the computation of FFO in accordance with Nareit's definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash amortization on loans and acquisition costs. Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO ("AFFO"), which we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets. In addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no assurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs. 
 A reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders to FFO and AFFO is as follows:

 Inflation, Deflation and Economic Condition Considerations 
 Substantially all of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include clauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 real estate taxes, insurance and many of the operating expenses it incurs. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. However, significant inflation rate increases over a prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income. 
 Interest rate increases could result in higher incremental borrowing costs for the Company and our tenants. The duration of the Company's indebtedness and our relatively low exposure to floating rate debt have mitigated the direct impact of inflation and interest rate increases. The degree and pace of these changes have had and may continue to have impacts on our business.

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
