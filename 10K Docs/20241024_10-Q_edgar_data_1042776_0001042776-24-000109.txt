 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. ("Piedmont," "we," "our," or "us"), or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in connection with other written or oral statements made to the press, potential investors, or others. Statements regarding future events and developments and our future performance, as well as management s expectations, beliefs, plans, estimates, or projections relating to the future, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by, or that include the words may, will, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, believe, continue, or other similar words. Examples of such statements in this report include descriptions of our real estate, financing, and operating objectives; discussions regarding future dividends; and discussions regarding potential acquisition and disposition activity and the potential impact of economic conditions on our real estate and lease portfolio, among others. 
 
 These statements are based on beliefs and assumptions of our management, which in turn are based on information available at the time the statements are made. Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding the demand for office space in the markets in which we operate, competitive conditions, and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. The forward-looking statements also involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 Economic, regulatory, socio-economic (including work from home and "hybrid" work policies), technological (e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning, Zoom, etc.), and other changes that impact the real estate market generally, the office sector or the patterns of use of commercial office space in general, or the markets where we primarily operate or have high concentrations of revenue; 
 The impact of competition on our efforts to renew existing leases or re-let space on terms similar to existing leases; 
 Lease terminations, lease defaults, lease contractions, or changes in the financial condition of our tenants, particularly by one of our large lead tenants; 
 Impairment charges on our long-lived assets or goodwill resulting therefrom; 
 The success of our real estate strategies and investment objectives, including our ability to implement successful redevelopment and development strategies or identify and consummate suitable acquisitions and divestitures; 
 The illiquidity of real estate investments, including economic changes, such as rising interest rates and available financing, which could impact the number of buyers/sellers of our target properties, and regulatory restrictions to which real estate investment trusts ("REITs") are subject and the resulting impediment on our ability to quickly respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties; 
 The risks and uncertainties associated with our acquisition and disposition of properties, many of which risks and uncertainties may not be known at the time of acquisition or disposition; 
 Development and construction delays, including the potential of supply chain disruptions, and resultant increased costs and risks; 
 Future acts of terrorism, civil unrest, or armed hostilities in any of the major metropolitan areas in which we own properties; 
 Risks related to the occurrence of cybersecurity incidents, including cybersecurity incidents against us or any of our properties or tenants, or a deficiency in our identification, assessment or management of cybersecurity threats impacting our operations and the public's reaction to reported cybersecurity incidents, including the reputational impact on our business and value of our common stock; 
 Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including environmental standards imposed on office building owners; 
 Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage, and our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost; 
 Additional risks and costs associated with directly managing properties occupied by government tenants, such as potential changes in the political environment, a reduction in federal or state funding of our governmental tenants, or an increased risk of default by government tenants during periods in which state or federal governments are shut down or on furlough; 
 Significant price and volume fluctuations in the public markets, including on the exchange which we listed our common stock; 
 Risks associated with incurring mortgage and other indebtedness, including changing capital reserve requirements on our lenders and rising interest rates for new debt financings;

Table of Contents 

 A downgrade in our credit ratings, the credit ratings of Piedmont Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") or the credit ratings of our or the Operating Partnership's unsecured debt securities, which could, among other effects, trigger an increase in the stated rate of one or more of our unsecured debt instruments; 
 The effect of future offerings of debt or equity securities on the value of our common stock; 
 Additional risks and costs associated with inflation and potential increases in the rate of inflation, including the impact of a possible recession, and any changes in governmental rules, regulations, and fiscal policies; 
 Uncertainties associated with environmental and regulatory matters; 
 Changes in the financial condition of our tenants directly or indirectly resulting from geopolitical developments that could negatively affect important supply chains and international trade, the termination or threatened termination of existing international trade agreements, or the implementation of tariffs or retaliatory tariffs on imported or exported goods; 
 The effect of any litigation to which we are, or may become, subject; 
 Additional risks and costs associated with owning properties occupied by tenants in particular industries, such as oil and gas, hospitality, travel, co-working, etc., including risks of default during start-up and during economic downturns; 
 Changes in tax laws impacting REITs and real estate in general, as well as our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), or other tax law changes which may adversely affect our stockholders; 
 The future effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures; 
 Actual or threatened public health epidemics or outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as governmental and private measures taken to combat such health crises; and 
 Other factors, including the risk factors discussed under Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Management believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and management undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. 
 
 Information Regarding Disclosures Presented 
 
 Annualized Lease Revenue ("ALR") is calculated by multiplying (i) current rental payments (defined as base rent plus operating expense reimbursements, if payable by the tenant on a monthly basis under the terms of a lease that has been executed, but excluding (a) rental abatements and (b) rental payments related to executed but not commenced leases for space that was covered by an existing lease), by (ii) 12. In instances in which contractual rents or operating expense reimbursements are collected on an annual, semi-annual, or quarterly basis, such amounts are multiplied by a factor of 1, 2, or 4, respectively, to calculate the annualized figure. For leases that have been executed but not commenced relating to unleased space, ALR is calculated by multiplying (i) the monthly base rental payment (excluding abatements) plus any operating expense reimbursements for the initial month of the lease term, by (ii) 12. Unless stated otherwise, this measure excludes revenues associated with development properties and properties taken out of service for redevelopment, if any.

 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the Million Unsecured Senior Notes ), which mature on July 15, 2029. Upon issuance of the Million Unsecured Senior Notes, Piedmont OP received net proceeds of million, reflecting a discount of approximately million which will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the Million Unsecured Senior Notes using the effective interest method. The Million Unsecured Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Piedmont. Interest on the Million Unsecured Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing January 15, 2025, and is subject to adjustment if the credit rating on the Million Unsecured Notes falls below investment grade, as defined in the credit agreement. 
 
 The Million Unsecured Senior Notes are subject to certain typical covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, include (a) a limitation on the ability of Piedmont and Piedmont OP to, among other things, incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness; (b) a limitation on the ability of Piedmont and Piedmont OP to merge, consolidate, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of their properties and assets substantially as an entirety; and (c) a requirement that Piedmont maintain a pool of unencumbered assets. 
 
 The net proceeds from the Million Unsecured Senior Notes were used to repay the balance outstanding under Piedmont's Million Unsecured 2022 Line of Credit and the remaining million outstanding on its Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan (see discussion below). Piedmont intends to use the remaining proceeds from the Million Unsecured Senior Notes, along with any sales proceeds from any potential property dispositions and Piedmont's available bank credit, to repay the Million Unsecured 2018 Term Loan that matures in March of 2025. 
 
 Also, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Piedmont OP entered into a new Million Unsecured 2024 Term Loan and used the net proceeds, along with its Million Unsecured 2022 Line of Credit, to repay the remaining million balance on the Million Unsecured 2022 Term Loan Facility and million of the Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan, resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million related to unamortized financing costs. The remaining million of the Million Unsecured 2023 Term Loan was extended and ultimately paid off with the proceeds of the aforementioned Million Unsecured Senior Notes. 
 
 The term of the Million Unsecured 2024 Term Loan is , with a maturity date of January 29, 2027. Piedmont may prepay the loan in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty. The stated interest rate spread over Adjusted SOFR can vary from to based upon the then current credit rating of Piedmont or Piedmont OP, whichever is higher. During any period that either Piedmont or Piedmont OP has received credit ratings from two different credit rating agencies that are not equivalent, the credit rating shall be determined as the higher of the two credit ratings. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable interest rate spread on the loan was , and the effective rate was . 
 
 The Million Unsecured 2024 Term Loan has certain financial covenants that require, among other things, the maintenance of an unencumbered interest rate coverage ratio of at least , an unencumbered leverage ratio of at least , a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least , a leverage ratio of no more than , and a secured debt ratio of no more than . 
 
 Finally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Piedmont repaid the remaining million balance of the Million Unsecured Senior Notes due 2024 with proceeds from the disposition of the One Lincoln Park building (see Note 8 below).

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Piedmont entered into interest rate swap agreements to fully hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash flows associated with the Million Unsecured 2024 Term Loan (see Note 3 above) through February 1, 2026. All of Piedmont's interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective cash flow hedges and are designated using SOFR. The maximum length of time over which Piedmont is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is months.

 Piedmont estimates that approximately million will be reclassified from OCI as an increase in interest expense over the next twelve months. Additionally, see Note 5 for fair value disclosures of Piedmont's derivative instruments. 
 
 Credit-risk-related Contingent Features 
 
 Piedmont has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if Piedmont defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Piedmont could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. If Piedmont were to breach any of the contractual provisions of the derivative contracts, it could be required to settle its liability obligations under the agreements at their termination value of the estimated fair values plus accrued interest, or approximately million as of September 30, 2024. Add itionally, Piedmont has rights of set-off under certain of its derivative agreements related to potential te rmination fees and amounts payable under the agreements, if a termination were to occur.

 million calculated based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was determined based on a negotiated potential selling price with an unrelated, third-party. On July 23, 2024, Piedmont completed the sale of the 750 West John Carpenter Freeway building (see Note 8 for further details). 
 
 Additionally during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Piedmont recognized an impairment charge of approximately million in conjunction with the sale of One Lincoln Park located in Dallas, Texas. The offer to purchase, contractual negotiations, due diligence, and completion of the sale all occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (see Note 8 for further details). 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Piedmont considered the decline in its stock price to be an indicator of impairment and performed an interim impairment assessment of its goodwill balance. This assessment involved comparing the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units (see Note 12 to the reporting unit s carrying value, inclusive of the goodwill balance allocated to the reporting unit. Based on its analysis, Piedmont determined that the only reporting unit where the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value (inclusive of the assigned goodwill balance) as of September 30, 2023 was the Minneapolis reporting unit. Consequently, Piedmont recorded an approximately million goodwill impairment charge equal to the goodwill balance that had been assigned to the Minneapolis reporting unit in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 The fair value measurements used in the evaluation described above were considered to be Level 3 valuations within the fair value hierarchy as defined by GAAP as the measurements involve projections of discounted future cash flows, which are derived from unobservable assumptions, the most subjective of which are capitalization rates and discount rates for each respective reporting unit. The range of discount rates and the capitalization rates used in the analysis for the Minneapolis reporting unit were to and to , respectively.

 Certain management employees' long-term equity incentive program is allocated between the deferred stock award units described above and a multi-year performance share program whereby actual awards are contingent upon Piedmont's total stockholder return ("TSR") performance relative to the TSR of a peer group of office REITs. The target incentives for these employees, as well as the peer group to be used for comparative purposes, are predetermined by the board of directors, based on advice given by a third-party compensation consultant. The number of shares earned, if any, are determined at the end of the multi-year performance period (or upon termination) and vest immediately. In the event that a participant's employment is terminated prior to the end of the multi-year period, in certain circumstances the participant may be entitled to a pro-rated award based on Piedmont's TSR relative performance as of the termination date.

 properties in Houston that do not meet the definition of an operating or reportable segment as the CODM does not regularly review these properties for purposes of allocating resources or assessing performance. Further, Piedmont does not maintain a significant presence nor anticipate further investment in this market. These properties are the primary contributors to accrual-based net operating income ("NOI") included in "Other" below. During the periods presented, there have been no material inter segment transactions. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as Piedmont's accounting policies. 
 
 Accrual-based net operating income ("NOI") by geographic segment is the primary performance measure reviewed by Piedmont's CODM to assess operating performance and consists only of revenues and expenses directly related to real estate rental operations. NOI is calculated by deducting property operating costs from lease revenues and other property related income. NOI reflects property acquisitions and dispositions, occupancy levels, rental rate increases or decreases, and the

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. Piedmont, "we," "our," or "us"). See also Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements preceding Part I, as well as the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We intend to use cash on hand, cash flows generated from the operation of our properties, net proceeds from the potential disposition of select properties, and our available bank credit as our primary sources of immediate liquidity, including to repay the 250 Million Unsecured 2018 Term Loan which is scheduled to mature in March of 2025. Other than the 250 Million Unsecured 2018 Term Loan, we currently have no other final debt maturities until 2027. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Our most consistent use of capital has historically been, and we believe will continue to be, to fund capital expenditures for our existing portfolio of properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we incurred the following types of capital expenditures (in thousands): 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Capital expenditures for redevelopment/renovations 62,898 39,938 Other capital expenditures, including building and tenant improvements 77,088 73,454 Total capital expenditures (1) 
 139,986 113,392 
 
 (1) Of the total amounts paid, approximately 13.4 million and 7.1 million relates to soft costs such as capitalized interest, payroll, and other property operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 "Capital expenditures for redevelopment/renovations" during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to building upgrades, primarily to the lobbies and the addition of tenant amenities at certain of our buildings, including: Galleria Towers in Dallas, Texas; The Exchange in Orlando, Florida; 999 Peachtree Street and Galleria on the Park in Atlanta, Georgia, and Meridian in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota, among others, most of which are anticipated to be completed during 2024. 
 
 "Other capital expenditures, including building and tenant improvements" includes all other capital expenditures during the period and is typically comprised of tenant and building improvements necessary to lease, maintain, or provide enhancements, including energy efficient equipment, to our existing portfolio of office properties. 
 
 We currently do not anticipate incurring any unusually large or material capital expenditures within any given year in order to meet recognized sustainable development standards, and achieve our environmental impact goals. 
 
 Given that our operating model frequently results in leases for multiple blocks of space to credit-worthy tenants, our leasing success can result in capital outlays which vary from one reporting period to another based upon the specific leases executed. For leases executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we committed to spend approximately 5.71 per square foot per year of lease term for tenant improvement allowances and lease commissions (net of expired lease commitments) as compared to 6.20 (net of expired lease commitments) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had two individually significant unrecorded tenant allowance commitments greater than 10 million. 
 
 In addition to the amounts that we have already committed to as a part of executed leases, we also anticipate continuing to incur similar market-based tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions in conjunction with procuring future leases for our existing portfolio of properties. Both the timing and magnitude of expenditures related to future leasing activity can vary due to a number of factors and are highly dependent on the size of the leased square footage, length of the lease term, and the competitive market conditions of the particular office market at the time a lease is being negotiated, in addition to the impact of inflation and rising costs of construction.

Table of Contents 

 Although reducing outstanding debt remains our priority, subject to the identification and availability of a few, select investment opportunities and our ability to consummate such acquisitions on satisfactory terms, acquiring new assets consistent with our investment strategy could also be a significant use of capital. 
 
 We also use capital resources to pay dividends to our stockholders. The amount and form of payment (cash or stock issuance) of future dividends to be paid to our stockholders will continue to be largely dependent upon (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities; (ii) our expectations of future cash flows; (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for debt repayments, development projects, and selective acquisitions of new properties; (iv) the timing of significant expenditures for tenant improvements, leasing commissions, building redevelopment projects, and general property capital improvements; (v) long-term dividend payout ratios for comparable companies; (vi) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, including potential sales of our properties; (vii) our desire to reduce overall leverage; and (viii) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT. With the fluctuating nature of cash flows and expenditures, we may periodically borrow funds on a short-term basis to cover timing differences in cash receipts and cash disbursements, including to pay dividends to our stockholders. 

Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Net loss applicable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 11.5 million, or 0.09 per diluted share, as compared with net loss applicable to common stockholders of 17.0 million, or 0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the 5.5 million decrease in net loss was the non-recurrence of an approximately 11.0 million impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was partially offset by increased interest expense, net of interest income, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, as well as the sale of two properties and the expiration of two large leases during 2024.

 Revenue 
 
 Rental and tenant reimbursement revenue decreased approximately 8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lost revenues during the downtime between certain large tenant expirations and the commencement or abatement expiration associated with recently executed leases, as well as the dispositions of One Lincoln Park and 750 West John Carpenter Freeway in 2024. The impact of these decreases is partially offset by the roll up of rental rates and new leases commencing during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Property management fee revenue increased approximately 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in the rate associated with our largest third-party property management agreement. This agreement was terminated in August 2024; therefore, property management fee revenue is expected to decrease in future periods. 
 
 Expense 
 
 Property operating costs decreased approximately 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower property tax expense due to lower tax assessments and successful appeals, as well as property dispositions during 2024 (as discussed above). These decreases were partially offset by higher recoverable operating expenses such as utilities, security, repairs and maintenance and other general expenses as tenant utilization and the overall leased percentage of our portfolio increased during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Amortization expense decreased approximately 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to amortization expense associated with certain lease intangible assets at our existing projects becoming fully amortized subsequent to July 1, 2023. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we reduced the carrying amount of goodwill for the Minneapolis reporting unit resulting in the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge of approximately 11.0 million. See Note 6 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 
 Interest expense increased approximately 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily driven by increased interest rates on floating-rate debt during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, as well as refinancing 1.2 billion of maturing debt at higher rates during the latter half of 2023 and first half of 2024. The increase was partially offset by a 1.5 million increase in capitalized interest associated with various redevelopment projects in progress during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Other income increased approximately 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to interest income earned on a portion of cash received from the 400 Million Unsecured Senior Notes due 2029 being invested and anticipated to be used to partially fund the repayment of the 250 Million Unsecured 2018 Term Loan in March 2025.

 Revenue 
 
 Rental and tenant reimbursement revenue decreased approximately 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lost revenues during the downtime between certain large tenant expirations and the commencement or abatement expiration associated with recently executed leases, as well as the dispositions of One Lincoln Park and 750 West John Carpenter Freeway in 2024. The impact of these decreases is partially offset by the roll up of rental rates and new leases commencing during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Property management fee revenue increased approximately 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in the rate associated with our largest third-party property management agreement. This agreement was terminated in September 2024; therefore, property management fee revenue is expected to decrease in future periods. 
 
 Other property related income increased approximately 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to increased occupancy and utilization at our properties and higher transient parking at our office projects during the current period, as compared to the prior period. 
 
 Expense 
 
 Depreciation expense increased approximately 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to additional building and tenant improvements placed in service subsequent to January 1, 2023. 
 
 Amortization expense decreased approximately 10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in amortization expense is associated with certain lease intangible assets at our existing projects becoming fully amortized subsequent to January 1, 2023.

 Issuer and Guarantor Financial Information 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Piedmont, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Piedmont OP, had four separate issuances totaling approximately 1.6 billion of senior unsecured notes payable outstanding that mature in 2028, 2029, 2030 and 2032 (see Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding each of these issuances) (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Piedmont OP, rank equally in right of payment with all of Piedmont OP's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, and would be effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of Piedmont OP s future mortgage or other secured indebtedness (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness) and to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of Piedmont OP s subsidiaries, whether secured or unsecured. 
 
 The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Piedmont, the parent entity that consolidates Piedmont OP and all other subsidiaries. In particular, Piedmont guarantees to each holder of the Notes that the principal and interest on the Notes will be paid in full when due, whether at the maturity dates of the respective loans, or upon acceleration, upon redemption, or otherwise; interest on overdue principal and interest on any overdue interest, if any, on the Notes will also be paid in full when due; and all other obligations of the Issuer to the holders of the Notes will be promptly paid in full. Piedmont's guarantee of the Notes is its senior unsecured obligation and ranks equally in right of payment with all of Piedmont's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and guarantees. Piedmont s guarantee of the Notes is effectively subordinated in right of payment to any future mortgage or other secured indebtedness or secured guarantees of Piedmont (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and guarantees); and all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, whether secured or unsecured, of Piedmont s subsidiaries.

 Net Operating Income by Geographic Segment 
 
 Our President and Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), who evaluates our portfolio and assesses the ongoing operations and performance of our projects utilizing the following geographic segments: Atlanta, Dallas, Orlando, Northern Virginia/Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, New York, and Boston. These operating segments are also our reportable segments. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we owned two properties in Houston that did not meet the definition of an operating or reportable segment as the CODM does not regularly review these properties for purposes of allocating resources or assessing performance, and we do not maintain a significant presence or anticipate further investment in this market. These two properties are included in "Other" below. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information and a reconciliation of Net income/(loss) applicable to Piedmont to Net Operating Income ("NOI").

 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Versus the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Atlanta 
 
 NOI increased due to several leases commencing at our Galleria on the Park and 999 Peachtree Street projects during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Orlando 
 
 NOI decreased primarily due to the expiration of the lease associated with the sole tenant at 501 West Church. The entire building has been re-leased to another tenant; however, the new lease is not expected to commence until late 2025. 
 
 Minneapolis 
 
 NOI decreased primarily due to the expiration of the leases associated with the sole tenants at two projects: 9320 Excelsior Boulevard and Meridian. Both projects have been designated as redevelopment assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Boston 
 
 NOI increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year due to a tenant's expansion at our 5 15 Wayside Road building in the latter half of 2023.

 Funds From Operations ("FFO"), Core Funds From Operations ("Core FFO"), and Adjusted Funds From Operations 
 AFFO 
 
 Net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP is the starting point for calculating FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO. These metrics are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be viewed as an alternative measurement of our operating performance to net income/(loss). Management believes that accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. As a result, we believe that the additive use of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentation, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. 
 
 We calculate FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition. NAREIT currently defines FFO as Net income/(loss) (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets, goodwill, and investment in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, along with appropriate adjustments to those reconciling items for joint ventures, if any. Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do; therefore, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to the computation made by other REITs. 
 
 We calculate Core FFO by starting with FFO, as defined by NAREIT, and adjusting for gains or losses on the early extinguishment of swaps and/or debt and any significant non-recurring or infrequent items. Core FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income/(loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that Core FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain infrequent or non-recurring items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core recurring business operations. As a result, we believe that Core FFO can help facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and provides a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential. Other REITs may not define Core FFO in the same manner as us; therefore, our computation of Core FFO may not be comparable to the computation made by other REITs. 
 
 We calculate AFFO by starting with Core FFO and adjusting for non-incremental capital expenditures and then adding back non-cash items including: non-real estate depreciation, straight-lined rents and fair value lease adjustments, non-cash components of interest expense and compensation expense, and by making similar adjustments for joint ventures, if any. AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income/(loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that AFFO is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in new properties or enhancements to existing properties that improve revenue growth potential. Other REITs may not define AFFO in the same manner as us; therefore, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to the computation of other REITs.

 (1) Core FFO was 0.36 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.43 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Approximately 0.03 of the decrease is due to increased interest expense, net of interest income, with the remaining decrease attributable to a combination of the sale of One Lincoln Park during the first quarter of 2024, the sale of 750 West John Carpenter Freeway during the second quarter of 2024, as well as the expiration of two large leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (2) We define non-incremental capital expenditures as capital expenditures of a recurring nature related to tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and building capital that do not incrementally enhance the underlying assets' income generating capacity. Tenant improvements, leasing commissions, building capital and deferred lease incentives incurred to lease space that was vacant at acquisition, leasing costs for spaces vacant for greater than one year, leasing costs for spaces at newly acquired properties for which in-place leases expire shortly after acquisition, improvements associated with the expansion of a building, and renovations that either enhance the rental rates of a building or change the property's underlying classification, such as from a Class B to a Class A property, are excluded from this measure. 
 (3) Includes potential dilution under the treasury stock method that would occur if our remaining unvested and potential stock awards vested and resulted in additional common shares outstanding. Such shares are not included when calculating net loss per share applicable to Piedmont for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, as they would reduce the loss per share presented.

 Property and Same Store Net Operating Income 
 
 Property Net Operating Income ("Property NOI") is a non-GAAP measure which we use to assess our operating results. We calculate Property NOI beginning with Net loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) before adjusting for interest, depreciation and amortization and removing any impairments and gains or losses from sales of property and other significant infrequent items that create volatility within our earnings and make it difficult to determine the earnings generated by our core ongoing business. Furthermore, we remove general and administrative expenses, income associated with property management performed by us for other organizations, and other income or expense items, such as interest income from loan investments. For Property NOI (cash basis), the effects of the reversal of the non-cash general reserve for uncollectible accounts, straight-lined rents and fair value lease revenue are also eliminated; while such effects are not adjusted in calculating Property NOI (accrual basis). Property NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income/(loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that Property NOI, on either a cash or accrual basis, is helpful to investors as a supplemental comparative performance measure of income generated by our properties alone without our administrative overhead. Other REITs may not define Property NOI in the same manner as we do; therefore, our computation of Property NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs. 
 
 We calculate Same Store Net Operating Income ("Same Store NOI") as Property NOI attributable to the properties (excluding undeveloped land parcels) that were (i) owned by us during the entire span of the current and prior year reporting periods; and (ii) that were not out of service for development or redevelopment during those periods. Same Store NOI, on either a cash or accrual basis, is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income/(loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that Same Store NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental comparative performance measure of the income generated from the same group of properties from one period to the next. Other REITs may not define Same Store NOI in the same manner as we do; therefore, our computation of Same Store NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.

Core EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of our operating performance. We believe that Core EBITDA is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it provides a metric for understanding the performance of our results from ongoing operations without taking into account the effects of non-cash expenses (such as depreciation and amortization), as well as items that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of our business.

 Overview 
 
 Our portfolio consists of office projects located within identified growth submarkets in large metropolitan cities concentrated primarily in the Sunbelt. We typically lease space to creditworthy corporate or governmental tenants on a long-term basis. As of September 30, 2024, our average lease was approximately 14,000 square feet with six years of lease term remaining. Leased percentage, as well as rent roll ups and roll downs, which we experience as a result of re-leasing, can fluctuate widely between buildings and between tenants, depending on when a particular lease is scheduled to commence or expire. 
 
 Leased Percentage 
 
 The leased percentage of our in-service portfolio increased to 88.8 leased as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 87.1 leased as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed approximately 2.0 million square feet of leasing, including approximately 938,000 square feet of new tenant leases which contributed to the increase in our in-service leased percentage as compared to December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, scheduled lease expirations for the portfolio for the next twelve months represent less than 9 of our ALR, some portion of which have already renewed. To the extent the square footage from new leases for currently vacant space in our in-service portfolio exceeds or falls short of the square footage associated with non-renewing expirations, such leases would increase or decrease our in-service leased percentage, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, three projects, 222 South Orange Avenue in Orlando, Florida, and 9320 Excelsior Boulevard and Meridian, both in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota, were classified as out of service as they undergo redevelopment. 
 
 Impact of Downtime, Abatement Periods, and Rental Rate Changes 
 
 Commencement of a lease associated with a new tenant typically occurs 6-18 months after the lease execution date, after refurbishment of the space is completed. The downtime between a lease expiration and the new lease's commencement can negatively impact Property NOI and Same Store NOI comparisons (both accrual and cash basis). In addition, office leases for both new and renewing tenants often contain upfront rental and/or operating expense abatement periods which delay the cash flow benefits of the lease even after the new or renewed lease has commenced, negatively impacting Property NOI and Same Store NOI on a cash basis until such abatements expire. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.5 million square 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 feet of executed leases for vacant space yet to commence or under rental abatement, representing approximately 48 million of future additional annual cash rents. 
 
 If we are unable to replace expiring leases with new or renewal leases at rental rates equal to or greater than the expiring rates, rental rate roll downs could occur and negatively impact Property NOI and Same Store NOI comparisons. As discussed above, our diverse portfolio and the magnitude of some of our tenants' leased spaces can result in rent roll ups and roll downs that can fluctuate widely on a project-by-project and a quarter-to-quarter basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced an 4.0 and 8.5 roll up in cash and accrual rents, respectively, on executed leases related to space vacant one year or less. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Same Store NOI decreased by (0.8) and (2.1) on a cash and accrual basis, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year, due to timing differences between lease expirations and the commencement, or expiration of abatements, associated with recently executed leases. Same Store NOI comparisons for any given period fluctuate as a result of the mix of net leasing activity in individual properties during the respective period. 
 
 Election as a REIT 
 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1998. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90 of our adjusted REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains attributable to our stockholders, as defined by the Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we may be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income for that year and for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost and/or penalties, unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income/(loss) and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT and intend to continue to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner that we will remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We have elected to treat one of our wholly owned subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). Our TRS performs non-customary services for tenants of buildings that we own, including real estate and non-real estate related-services. Any earnings related to such services performed by our TRS are subject to federal and state income taxes. In addition, for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, our investments in TRS cannot exceed 20 of the value of our total assets. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 We are exposed to inflation risk, as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are provisions in the majority of our tenant leases that are intended to protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include rent steps, reimbursement billings for operating expense pass-through charges, real estate tax, and insurance on a per square-foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above certain per square-foot allowances. However, due to the long-term nature of the leases, the leases may not readjust their reimbursement rates frequently enough to fully cover inflation. 

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus, resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no material changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 We are subject to certain commitments and contingencies with regard to certain transactions. Refer to Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further explanation.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our future income, cash flows, and estimated fair values of our financial instruments depend in part upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency, exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. As of September 30, 2024, our primary market risk is our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in connection with any future borrowings on our 600 Million Unsecured 2022 Line of Credit. Many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk, including changes in the method pursuant to which SOFR rates are determined. 
 
 Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow primarily through a low-to-moderate level of overall borrowings, as well as managing the variability in rate fluctuations on our outstanding debt. As such, all of our debt as of September 30, 2024 is currently based on fixed or effectively-fixed interest rates to hedge against volatility in the credit markets. We do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes, as such all of our debt and derivative instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading purposes. 
 
 The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately 2.3 billion and 2.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our interest rate swap agreements in place as of September 30, 2024 carried a notional amount totaling 450 million with a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 5.07 , and our interest swap agreements as of December 31, 2023 carried a notional amount totaling 250 million with a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 4.79 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total outstanding debt subject to fixed, or effectively fixed, interest rates totaling approximately 2.2 billion has an average effective interest rate of approximately 6.01 per annum with expirations ranging from 2025 to 2032. A change in the market interest rate impacts the net financial instrument position of our fixed-rate debt portfolio but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows for that portfolio. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 our 600 Million Unsecured 2022 Line of Credit had no amounts outstanding, which is the only facility subject to a variable interest rate. To the extent that we borrow additional funds in the future under the 600 Million Unsecured 2022 Line of Credit or potential future variable-rate debt facilities, we would have exposure to increases in interest rates, which would potentially increase our cost of debt. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Management s Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, including providing a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
