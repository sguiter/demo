 CYTODYN INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AUGUST 31, 2024 (Unaudited) million as of August 31, 2024. These factors, among others, including the various matters discussed in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies , raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, complete the development of its product candidate, leronlimab, obtain approval to commercialize leronlimab from regulatory agencies, continue to outsource manufacturing of leronlimab, and ultimately generate revenues and attain profitability. The Company plans to continue to engage in research and development activities related to leronlimab and a new or modified longer-acting therapeutic for multiple indications and expects to incur significant research and

 Conversion price per share upon five trading days' notice Party that controls the conversion rights Investor Investor Maturity date April 5, 2025 April 23, 2025 Security interest All Company assets excluding intellectual property In addition to standard anti-dilution adjustments, the conversion price of the April 2, 2021 Note and April 23, 2021 Note is subject to full-ratchet anti-dilution protection, pursuant to which the conversion price will be automatically reduced to equal the effective price per share in any new offering by the Company of equity securities that have registration rights, are registered, or become registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The April 2, 2021 Note and April 23, 2021 Note provide for liquidated damages upon failure to deliver common stock within specified timeframes and require the Company to maintain a share reservation of million shares of common stock for each Note. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, in satisfaction of redemptions, the Company and April 23, 2021 Noteholder entered into exchange agreements, pursuant to which the April 23, 2021 Note was partitioned into new notes (the Partitioned Notes with an aggregate principal amount of million, which was exchanged concurrently with the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock. The outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note was reduced by the Partitioned Notes to a principal amount of million. The Company accounted for the Partitioned Notes and the exchange settlements as induced conversions, and, accordingly, recorded a non-cash loss on convertible debt induced conversion of million for the three months ended August 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the holders of the April 2, 2021 and April 23, 2021 Notes waived all provisions in the convertible notes that, based on the occurrence of various events through that date, could have triggered the imposition of a default interest rate, a downward adjustment of the conversion price, or specified other provisions relating to default, breach or imposition of a penalty. Accordingly, the Company was not in default under the Notes on September 30, 2024. Placement Agent Notes During the period April through June 2023, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements pursuant to which the Company issued secured promissory notes bearing interest at a rate of and with an 18-month term to accredited investors through a placement agent Placement Agent Notes for a total principal amount of approximately million. The Placement Agent Notes were secured by the net cash recovery, if any, by the Company in its dispute with Amarex and provided the investors with a right to convert the unpaid principal and accrued but unpaid interest into shares of common stock upon the occurrence of an event of default. The Placement Agent Notes had maturity dates during the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. In connection with the note issuances, the Company issued warrants to investors to purchase approximately million shares of common stock with a term and an exercise price of per share. The Company also issued warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock to the placement agent with a term and an exercise price of per share. During June 2023, an amendment was entered into with the investors of the Placement Agent Notes, which stated that the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on the notes would be converted into shares of common stock and warrants as of the first closing of a subsequent private placement of common stock and warrants through a placement agent. The deemed purchase price of a unit of share plus warrant was fixed at of the lower of the intraday volume weighted average price VWAP on the date of the first closing and last closing of the private

 per share, compared to per share in the original private placement. The amendment also allowed investors to retain an interest in the Amarex settlement after conversion. In July 2023, the first closing of the subsequent private placement of common stock and warrants through a placement agent occurred. Therefore, the Placement Agent Notes were converted into units with the same pricing as the private placement described in Note 6, Private Placements of Common Stock and Warrants Private placements of common stock and warrants through placement agent in the Company s 2024 Form 10-K. Due to the settlement with Amarex in July 2024, the Company owed approximately million to Placement Agent Note investors, recorded as a loss on derivatives, of which approximately million was paid in the three months ended August 31, 2024. In accordance with the prescribed accounting guidance, the Company measured fair value of liability classified warrants using fair value hierarchy included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fair Value of Financial Instruments . The Company s derivative liability is classified within Level 3. Please refer to Note 5, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest , in the Company s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information. million shares of common stock were exercised at a exercise price, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million. The Company also issued approximately million shares of common stock as bonus shares in the tender offer. The Company paid the placement agent a total cash fee of approximately million, equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering, as well as repricing all warrants previously issued to the placement agent to per share. In connection with the tender offer, the Company recognized the following issuance costs: million in cash paid to placement agent, million in legal fees, a million change in fair value of the exercised warrants, and a million change in fair value due to repricing the placement agent warrants.

 active equity incentive plan, the CytoDyn Inc. Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the EIP ). As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, the EIP covered a total of million and million shares of common stock, respectively. The evergreen provision automatically increased the number of shares of common stock subject to the EIP by an amount equal to of the total outstanding shares on June 1, 2024. The EIP provides for awards of stock options to purchase shares of common stock, restricted and unrestricted shares of common stock, restricted stock units RSUs ), and performance share units PSUs ). The Company recognizes the compensation cost of employee and director services received in exchange for equity awards based on the grant date estimated fair value of the awards. Share-based compensation cost is recognized over the period during which the employee or director is required to provide service in exchange for the award and, as forfeitures occur, the associated compensation cost recognized to date is reversed. For awards with performance-based payout conditions, the Company recognizes compensation cost based on the probability of achieving the performance conditions, with changes in expectations recognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of change. Any recognized compensation cost is reversed if the conditions ultimately are not met. Stock-based compensation for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively.

 million. Except for a single payment due on or before December 31, 2024, the entirety of the Total Balance is conditional, and will only be due and payable, upon the Company achieving a qualifying Revenue event, as defined in the Side Letter. Under the Side Letter, the Company has agreed to pay of its qualifying Revenue generated in each calendar year, if any, with such payments to be applied to reduce the Total Balance until it is repaid in full. Interest will not accrue on the Total Balance throughout the prospective repayment period. Revenue is defined in the Side Letter as: the gross revenue generated by Client and its Affiliates, less the following items (if not previously deducted from the amount invoiced): (a) reasonable and customary trade, quantity, and cash discounts actually granted and legally permitted wholesaler chargebacks actually paid or credited by Client and its Affiliates to wholesalers of products; (b) reasonable, customary, and legally permitted rebates and retroactive price reductions actually granted; (c) freight charges for the delivery of products; (d) the portion of the administrative fees paid during the relevant time period to group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical benefit managers and/or government-mandated Medicare or Medicaid Prescription Drug Plans relating specifically to the product; and (e) sales, use or excise taxes imposed and actually paid in connection with the sale of products (but excluding any value added taxes or taxes based on income or gross receipts). The payment due on or before December 31, 2024, is included in accounts payable, and the remaining balance of approximately million is included in other long-term liabilities. Operating lease commitments We lease our principal office location in Vancouver, Washington (the Vancouver Lease ). The Vancouver Lease expires on April 30, 2026. Consistent with the guidance in ASC 842, Leases , we have recorded this lease in our consolidated balance sheet as an operating lease. For the purpose of determining the right of use asset and associated lease liability, we determined that the renewal of the Vancouver lease was not reasonably probable. The lease does not include any restrictions or covenants requiring special treatment under ASC 842, Leases. Operating lease costs for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately thousand and thousand, respectively. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other non-current assets and the current portion of operating lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and compensation on the consolidated balance sheets. The long-term operating lease liabilities are presented separately as operating lease on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes the operating lease balances: Liabilities Current operating lease liability Non-current operating lease liability Total operating lease liability

Legal proceedings As of August 31, 2024, the Company did not record any accruals related to the outcomes of the legal matters described below. It is not possible to determine the outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, if any, could be material to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Securities Class Action Lawsuits On March 17, 2021, a stockholder filed a putative class-action lawsuit (the March 17, 2021 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington against the Company and certain former officers. The complaint generally alleges the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the viability of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19. On April 9, 2021, a second stockholder filed a similar putative class action lawsuit in the same court, which the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 23, 2021. On August 9, 2021, the court appointed lead plaintiffs for the March 17, 2021 lawsuit. On December 21, 2021, lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which is brought on behalf of an alleged class of those who purchased the Company s common stock between March 27, 2020 and May 17, 2021. The amended complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making purportedly false or misleading statements concerning, among other things, the safety and efficacy of leronlimab as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the Company s CD10 and CD12 clinical trials, and its HIV Biologic License Application BLA ). The amended complaint also alleges that the individual defendants violated Section 20A of the Exchange Act by selling shares of the Company s common stock purportedly while in possession of material nonpublic information. The amended complaint seeks, among other relief, a ruling that the case may proceed as a class action and unspecified damages and attorneys fees and costs. On February 25, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On June 24, 2022, lead plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint is brought on behalf of an alleged class of those who purchased the Company s common stock between March 27, 2020 and March 30, 2022, makes similar allegations, names the same defendants, asserts the same claims as the prior complaint, adds a claim for alleged violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) promulgated thereunder, and seeks the same relief as the prior complaint. All defendants have filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint in whole or in part. The Company and the individual defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing in the complaint and intend to vigorously defend the matter. Since this case is in an early stage where the number of plaintiffs is not known, and the claims do not specify an amount of damages, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit and cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss or range of loss the Company may incur.

 Overview The Company is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of its product candidate, leronlimab, which is being studied for oncology and inflammation, as well as other potential indications, including HIV and MASH. Our current business strategy is the clinical development of leronlimab, which may include the following: 1. Conducting a Phase II study of leronlimab in patients with relapsed/refractory microsatellite stable colorectal cancer; 2. Conducting a Phase II study exploring leronlimab and its effects on inflammation; and 3. Continuing our work researching and developing a new or modified long-acting version of leronlimab. 
 Other programs that may be pursued include steatosis and liver fibrosis associated with MASH, either alone or as a combination therapy; and for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with current standard of care, and/or exploring other trials with current standard of care and other cancer and immunologic indications. We will need significant additional funding to execute the business strategy described above, including conducting additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, in furtherance of our efforts to obtain FDA approval to commercialize leronlimab. In addition to traditional fundraising the Company will pursue non-dilutive financing opportunities, such as license agreements and co-development or strategic partnerships, to help implement its strategy. Corporate developments During the quarter ended August 31, 2024, the Company completed a tender offer resulting in net proceeds of approximately 10.4 million. On July 2, 2024, the Company and Amarex, the Company s former CRO, entered into an agreement settling a lawsuit filed by the Company in October 2021 (the Settlement Agreement ).The terms of the Settlement Agreement include: (i) the payment by Amarex of 12,000,000 to the Company, of which 10,000,000 was paid on execution of the Settlement Agreement and the balance will be paid on or before July 2, 2025; (ii) the release of the Company s surety bond posted in the lawsuit and the return of the Company s cash collateral in the amount of 6,500,000 provided as security to the surety; (iii) the crediting of all amounts claimed by Amarex as due and payable for its CRO services, totaling approximately 14,000,000, against the Company s outstanding balance, reducing the balance to zero, with no funds required to be paid by the Company; and (iv) a mutual release of claims, resolving all legal claims between the parties.

 Results of Operations Fluctuations in operating results The Company s operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on the outcomes, number and timing of pre-clinical and clinical studies, patient enrollment and/or completion rates in the studies, and their related effect on research and development expenses, regulatory and compliance activities, activities related to seeking FDA approval of our drug product, general and administrative expenses, professional fees, and legal and regulatory proceedings and related consequences. We require a significant amount of capital to continue to operate; therefore, we regularly conduct financing offerings to raise capital, which may result in various forms of non-cash interest expense or other expenses. Additionally, we periodically seek to negotiate settlement of debt payment obligations in exchange for equity securities of the Company and enter into warrant exchanges or modifications that may result in non-cash charges. Our ability to continue to fund operations will depend on our ability to raise additional funds. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern sections in this Item 2 of Part I and Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors included in this quarterly report and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2024 Form 10-K. The results of operations were as follows for the periods presented:

Research and development R D expenses R D expenses consisted of the following:

The future trend of our R D expenses is dependent on the costs of any future clinical trials, our decision-making and timing of which indications on which to focus our future efforts toward the development and study of leronlimab, which may include pre-clinical and clinical studies for oncology, MASH and HIV related indications, as well as efforts to develop a long-acting new or modified therapeutic, the timing and outcomes of such efforts, and the timing of the final close-out of closed studies.

Table of Contents 
 The decrease in interest and other expenses for the three-month period ended August 31, 2024, compared with the same period in the prior year, was primarily due to the decrease in loss on note extinguishment and finance charges. The decrease in loss on note extinguishment is due to note extinguishments occurring in the prior period. The decrease in finance charges is due to restructuring the balance due to Samsung, which removed any future interest. The decrease in interest and other expenses was offset by an increase in loss on derivatives due to the value of the interest in the Amarex settlement received by investors in the Placement Agent Notes. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of August 31, 2024, we had a total of approximately 24.9 million in cash and approximately 69.6 million in short-term liabilities. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and require a significant amount of capital in the future as we continue to seek approval to commercialize leronlimab. There can be no assurance that future funding will be available to us when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We sell securities and incur debt when the terms of such arrangements are deemed acceptable to both parties under then current circumstances and as necessary to fund our current and projected cash needs. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 199.3 million shares of common stock available for issuance in new financing transactions. Since inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the public and private sale of equity securities as well as with proceeds from issuance of convertible notes and related party notes payable. The Company intends to finance its future operating activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of equity and debt securities. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities to raise additional capital is likely to result in dilution to stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of common shares. If the Company raises funds through the issuance of additional preferred stock, convertible debt securities or other debt or equity financing, the related transaction documents may contain covenants restricting its operations. During the 2021 fiscal year, the Company entered into long-term convertible notes that are secured by all of our assets (excluding our intellectual property), and include certain restrictive provisions, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and future dilutive issuances of securities, any of which could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. Future third-party funding arrangements may also require the Company to relinquish valuable rights. Additional capital, if available, may not be available on reasonable or non-dilutive terms. Cash The Company s cash position of approximately 24.9 million and no restricted cash, as of August 31, 2024, increased by approximately 21.8 million and decreased by approximately 6.7 million, respectively, when compared to the balance of 3.1 million and 6.7 million, respectively, as of May 31, 2024. This increase was primarily the result of approximately 10.0 million cash received for a legal settlement, the release of the 6.7 million surety bond, and approximately 9.7 million in cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended August 31, 2024. Refer to Item 1, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Going Concern , and the Going Concern discussion below for information regarding concerns about the Company s ability to continue to fund its operations and satisfy its payment obligations and commitments. A summary of cash flows and changes between the periods presented is as follows: 

Three months ended August 31, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 5,440 (4,495) 9,935 Net cash provided by/ used in investing activities Net cash provided by financing activities 9,667 4,019 5,648

Table of Contents 
 Cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately 5.4 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, representing an improvement of approximately 9.9 million compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in the net amount of cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a legal settlement of approximately 10.0 million. Refer to Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings Settlement of Amarex Dispute for further discussion. Cash provided by financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately 9.7 million during the three months ended August 31, 2024, an increase of approximately 5.6 million compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided was primarily the result of raising funds through a warrant exchange tender offer during the current period compared a lower amount raised through private placements of common stock and warrants in the prior period. Pre-launch inventories The Company previously capitalized pre-launch inventories which were subsequently charged-off in October 2022 for GAAP accounting purposes due to no longer qualifying for pre-launch inventory capitalization resulting from the withdrawal of the Company s biologic license application submission. Work-in-progress and finished drug product inventories continue to be physically maintained, can be used for clinical trials, and can be sold commercially upon regulatory approval if the shelf-lives can be extended as a result of the performance of on-going stability tests. Raw materials continue to be maintained to that they can be used in the future if needed. Convertible debt April 2, 2021 Convertible Note On April 2, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of 28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of 25.0 million, after 3.4 million of debt discount and 0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10 per annum, contains a stated conversion price of 10.00 per share, and matures in April 2025. The April 2, 2021 Note required monthly debt reduction payments of 7.5 million for the six months beginning in May 2021, which could also be satisfied by payments on other notes held by the noteholder or its affiliates. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to 3.5 million. As of August 31, 2024, the outstanding balance of the April 2, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was approximately 7.7 million. April 23, 2021 Convertible Note On April 23, 2021, we issued a convertible note with a principal amount of 28.5 million resulting in net cash proceeds of 25.0 million, after 3.4 million of debt discount and 0.1 million of offering costs. The note accrues interest daily at a rate of 10 per annum, contains a stated conversion price of 10.00 per share, and matures in April 2025. Beginning six months after the issuance date, the noteholder may request monthly redemptions of up to 7.0 million. As of August 31, 2024, the outstanding balance of the April 23, 2021 Note, including accrued interest, was approximately 37.9 million.

 Common stock We have 1,750.0 million authorized shares of common stock. The table below summarizes intended uses of common stock. 

As of (in millions) August 31, 2024 Issuable upon: Warrant exercises 232.2 Convertible preferred stock and undeclared dividends conversion 37.8 Outstanding stock option exercises 25.8 Reserved for issuance pursuant to future stock-based awards under equity incentive plan 23.1 Reserved and issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes 12.0 Total shares reserved for future uses 330.9 Common stock outstanding 1,219.8 As of August 31, 2024, we had approximately 199.3 million unreserved authorized shares of common stock available for issuance. Our ability to continue to fund our operations depends on our ability to raise capital. The funding necessary for our operations may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we deplete our cash reserves, we may have to discontinue our operations and liquidate our assets. In extreme cases, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of August 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Contractual Obligations Refer to Note 3, Accrued Liabilities and Compensation , Note 4, Convertible Instruments and Accrued Interest , and Note 9 , Commitments and Contingencies included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, and Notes 5 and 10 in Part II, Item 8 in the 2024 Form 10-K. Legal Proceedings The Company is a party to various legal proceedings described in Part I, Item 1, Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-Q. The Company recognizes accruals for such proceedings to the extent a loss is determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The best estimate of a loss within a possible range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is more probable than another, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If it is determined that a material loss is not probable but reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the possible loss is disclosed. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including the defense and other litigation-related costs and expenses that may be incurred by the Company, as the outcomes of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the outcomes could differ significantly from recognized accruals. Therefore, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of any proceeding, if in excess of a recognized accrual, if any, could be material to the Company s consolidated financial statements. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had not recorded any accruals related to the outcomes of the legal matters discussed in this Form 10-Q. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had losses for all periods presented, except for the current quarter. Net income of 19.2 million in the current quarter resulted from the recovery of approximately 25.0 million in clinical expenses due to the settlement of the Company s litigation with Amarex, which is a non-recurring event. The Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately 872.3 million as of August 31, 2024. These factors, among several others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuance as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional operating capital, complete the development of its product candidate, leronlimab, obtain approval to commercialize leronlimab from regulatory agencies, continue to outsource manufacturing of leronlimab, and ultimately achieve revenues and attain profitability. The Company plans to continue to engage in research and development activities related to leronlimab and a new or modified longer-acting therapeutic for multiple indications and expects to incur significant research and development expenses in the future, primarily related to its regulatory compliance, including performing additional clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval of its product candidate for commercialization. These research and development activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The Company intends to finance its future development activities and its working capital needs primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities, combined with additional funding from other sources. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these endeavors. See also Liquidity and Capital Resources above. New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements in this Form 10-Q for the discussion. Critical Accounting Estimates This discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company s critical accounting estimates are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2024 Form 10-K. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no material changes from the information previously reported in Part II, Item 7A of the 2024 Form 10-K. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024 (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our

 Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded, based upon the evaluation described above, that as of August 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. During the quarter ended August 31, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

You should carefully consider those risk factors in addition to other information in this Form 10-Q. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Issuances of Shares in Convertible Note Exchange Transactions In August 2024, the Company and the holder of its April 23, 2021 Note, in partial satisfaction of the holder s redemption rights, entered into an exchange agreement pursuant to which a portion of the original note was partitioned into a new note with an aggregate principal amount of 0.5 million. The new note was exchanged concurrently with issuance of a total of approximately 4.9 million shares of common stock. The Company relied on the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act in connection with the exchange transaction.
