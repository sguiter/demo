Pursuant to the RPA, the party may purchase certain of the Company's customer receivables at a discounted rate, subject to a limit that as of any date, the total amount of purchased receivables held by the party, less the amount of all collections received on such receivables, may not exceed . The RPA has an indefinite term and the agreement remains in effect until it is terminated by either party. Factoring under the RPA Agreement is treated as a true sale of accounts receivable by the Company.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 
 There were 13 weeks included in the results of operations for the first quarters ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The results for the first quarter ended September 27, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year. 
 The first quarter ended September 27, 2024 compared to the first quarter ended September 29, 2023 
 The following table sets forth, for the first quarter ended indicated, financial data from the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss: (In thousands) September 27, 2024 As a of Total Net Revenue September 29, 2023 As a of Total Net Revenue Net revenues 204,431 100.0 180,991 100.0 Cost of revenues 152,641 74.7 130,464 72.1 Gross margin 51,790 25.3 50,527 27.9 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 33,153 16.2 35,794 19.8 Research and development 18,383 9.0 31,872 17.6 Amortization of intangible assets 11,235 5.5 12,547 6.9 Restructuring and other charges 2,260 1.1 9,546 5.3 Acquisition costs and other related expenses 177 0.1 969 0.5 Total operating expenses 65,208 31.9 90,728 50.1 Loss from operations (13,418) (6.6) (40,201) (22.2) Interest income 544 0.3 103 0.1 Interest expense (8,906) (4.4) (7,863) (4.4) Other expense, net (1,339) (0.6) (1,774) (1.0) Loss before income tax benefit (23,119) (11.3) (49,735) (27.5) Income tax benefit (5,594) (2.7) (13,027) (7.2) Net loss (17,525) (8.6) (36,708) (20.3) 
 R EVENUES 
 Total revenues increased 23.4 million, or 13.0 , to 204.4 million during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 181.0 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. Revenues increased year over year as we pivoted our resources in fiscal 2024 to executing on our program base, including progress toward full rate production of our common processing architecture. As a result, we are experiencing a temporary volume shift in our total revenue, including our point in time revenue and over time revenue which increased by approximately 16.0 million and 7.4 million, respectively. Over time revenue represented 55 of total revenues during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 58 of total revenues during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. 
 Revenue increases were driven by the modules and sub-assemblies, integrated solutions, and components product groupings which increased 8.3 million, 7.8 million and 7.4 million, respectively during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024 when compared to the prior period. The increase in total revenue was primarily driven by the other, radar, other sensor and effector, and electronic warfare end applications with increases of 14.3 million, 7.0 million, 5.2 million, and 1.9 million respectively, partially offset by a decrease to C4I end applications of 5.0 million. The increase in total revenue was also driven by higher Other, Space, and Land platforms of 20.2 million, 9.3 million and 8.6 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases to Airborne and Naval platforms of 14.2 million and 0.5 million, respectively. The largest program increases were related to a strategic weapons program, a secure processing program, and MH-60R/S, partially offset by decreases in the F-35, AARGM, and CH-53K programs when compared to the prior period. There were no programs comprising 10 or more of our revenues for the first quarters ended September 27, 2024 or September 29, 2023.

G ROSS M ARGIN 
 Gross margin was 25.3 for the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, a decrease of 260 basis points from the 27.9 gross margin realized during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. The lower gross margin was driven primarily by higher manufacturing adjustments and inventory reserves of 11.2 million, partially offset by net EAC change impact on our programs recognized over time of approximately 8.3 million recorded in the quarter, an incremental improvement of approximately 8.2 million, or 500 basis points, when compared to the prior period. 
 We had the following aggregate effects of favorable and unfavorable margin impacts as a result of changes in estimates across our portfolio for the period presented: 
 First Quarters Ended (in thousands) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Gross favorable 7,774 6,335 Gross unfavorable (16,067) (22,798) Net impact of changes in estimates (8,293) (16,463) 
 The changes in estimates are assessed based on historical results and cumulative adjustments are recorded to recognize revenue to date based on changes in estimated margin on programs, including impact of contract amendments factored for potential risks and opportunities. We utilize the latest and best information available when revising our estimates and apply consistent judgement across the full portfolio of programs. 
 S ELLING , G ENERAL AND A DMINISTRATIVE 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.6 million, or 7.4 , to 33.2 million during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 35.8 million in the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the savings from reductions in force initiated in fiscal 2024, resulting in lower compensation costs including 5.0 million of salary and benefit expense as well as lower software licensing fees of 1.2 million, and lower directors fees of 0.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher stock-based compensation of 2.9 million. 
 R ESEARCH AND D EVELOPMENT 
 Research and development expenses decreased 13.5 million, or 42.3 , to 18.4 million during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 31.9 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. The decrease during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024 was primarily driven by the savings from reductions in force initiated in fiscal 2024, reducing headcount by approximately 130, resulting in lower expense of 10.0 million as well as decreased spend on equipment, supplies, and outside services of 3.8 million. 
 A MORTIZATION OF I NTANGIBLE A SSETS 
 Amortization of intangible assets decreased 1.3 million to 11.2 million during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 12.5 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to various developed technology and customer relationship intangibles being fully amortized in fiscal 2024. 
 R ESTRUCTURING AND O THER C HARGES 
 We incurred 2.3 million of restructuring and other charges during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 9.5 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. Restructuring and other charges during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024 are primarily related to severance related charges. Restructuring and other charges during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023 includes 9.5 million of severance costs related to a workforce reduction that eliminated approximately 150 positions. 
 A CQUISITION C OSTS AND O THER R ELATED E XPENSES 
 There was an immaterial amount of acquisition costs and other related expenses during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024. The acquisition costs and other related expenses during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023 includes 0.3 million related to the conclusion of t he Board of Directors' review of strategic alternatives, as well as 0.3 million for third-party advisory fees in connection with engagements by activist investors. 
 26 

I NTEREST E XPENSE 
 We incurred 8.9 million of interest expense during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 7.9 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. The increase was driven by a higher interest rate and higher average outstanding borrowings during the period on our existing credit facility (the "Revolver"). 
 O THER E XPENSE, N ET 
 Other expense, net was 1.3 million during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, as compared to 1.8 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. The first quarter ended September 27, 2024 includes 2.3 million of financing costs, 0.5 million of consulting costs, and 0.2 million securities class action expenses, partially offset by 1.5 million net foreign currency translation gains and 0.2 million of other income. The first quarter ended September 29, 2023 includes net foreign currency translation losses of 1.0 million, financing costs and litigation and settlement expenses of 0.5 million, partially offset by other income of 0.3 million. 
 I NCOME T AXES 
 We recorded an income tax benefit of 5.6 million and 13.0 million on a loss before income taxes of 23.1 million and 49.7 million for the first quarters ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. 
 During the first quarters ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, we recognized a tax provision of 0.2 million and 1.2 million related to stock compensation shortfalls, respectively. 
 The effective tax rate for the first quarters ended September 27, 2024 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development credits, non-deductible compensation and state taxes. The effective tax rate for the first quarter ended September 29, 2023 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development credits and state taxes. 
 We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards and state research and developmental tax credit carryforwards. Based on forecasted taxable income and the scheduled reversal of the remaining deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that all other deferred tax assets will be recognized. 
 
 L IQUIDITY AND C APITAL R ESOURCES 
 Our primary sources of liquidity come from existing cash and cash generated from operations, our Revolver, our ability to raise capital under our universal shelf registration statement and our ability to factor our receivables. Our near-term fixed commitments for cash expenditures consist primarily of payments under operating leases and inventory purchase commitments. We have experienced growth in our working capital balances and, in particular, related to unbilled receivables and inventory over the last several years. As we receive follow-on production awards, we believe that both unbilled receivables and inventory is expected to convert to cash reducing our working capital balances. 
 Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, our available Revolver, cash generated from operations and our financing capabilities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 Shelf Registration Statement 
 On October 4, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR with the SEC. The shelf registration statement, which was effective upon filing with the SEC, registered each of the following securities: debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants and units. We intend to use the proceeds from financings using the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, which may include the following: 
 the acquisition of other companies or businesses; 
 the repayment and refinancing of debt; 
 capital expenditures; 
 working capital; and 
 other purposes as described in the prospectus supplement. 
 We have an unlimited amount available under the shelf registration statement.

Revolving Credit Facilities 
 On November 7, 2023, due to the uncertainty surrounding a government shutdown or prolonged continuing resolution and the potential impact on the second quarter and fiscal 2024 results, we proactively executed Amendment No. 5 to the Revolver, as amended to date, with a syndicate of commercial banks and Bank of America, N.A acting as the administrative agent allowing for a temporary increase in the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio covenant requirement from 4.50 to 5.25 for the second quarter ended December 29, 2023. As part of Amendment No. 5, the Company agreed to a temporary reduction of Revolver capacity to 750.0 million through the earlier of May 15, 2024 or the filing of the compliance certificate for the period ended March 29, 2024. 
 On August 13, 2024, we executed Amendment No. 6 to the Revolver, decreasing the permanent borrowing capacity to 900.0 million, with a temporary reduction in credit availability to 750.0 million until we meet a minimum consolidated EBITDA level of 75.0 million. 
 During the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, we did not have any additional borrowings or repayments. As of September 27, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and conditions under the Revolver and expects to be within our covenant and conditions for the remainder of the year. The borrowing capacity as defined under the Revolver as of September 27, 2024 is approximately 750.0 million, less outstanding borrowings of 591.5 million. 
 Receivables Purchase Agreement 
 On September 27, 2022, we entered into an uncommitted receivables purchase agreement RPA ), pursuant to which we may offer to sell certain customer receivables, subject to the terms and conditions of the RPA. The RPA is an uncommitted arrangement such that we are not obligated to sell any receivables and the party has no obligation to purchase any receivables from us. Pursuant to the RPA, the party may purchase certain of our customer receivables at a discounted rate, subject to a limit that as of any date, the total amount of purchased receivables held by the party, less the amount of all collections received on such receivables, may not exceed 20.0 million. The RPA has an indefinite term and the agreement remains in effect until it is terminated by either party. On March 14, 2023, we amended the RPA to increase the capacity from 20.0 million to 30.6 million. On June 21, 2023, we further amended the RPA to increase the capacity from 30.6 million to 60.0 million. On August 13, 2024, we terminated the RPA in conjunction with entering into a new receivables purchase and service agreement. 
 On August 13, 2024, we entered into a 60.0 million committed receivables purchase and servicing agreement RPSA with a new party. The RPSA has an initial term of two years. Pursuant to the RPSA, the new party has committed to purchase receivables from a certain number of agreed upon customers, maintaining a balance of purchased receivables at or below 60.0 million. We factored accounts receivable and incurred factoring fees of approximately 43.7 million and 0.4 million, respectively, for the first quarter ended September 27, 2024. We received 18.8 million of factoring proceeds on the first business day of the second quarter that were outstanding as of September 27, 2024. The 18.8 million was included in Accounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 27, 2024. We factored accounts receivable and incurred factoring fees of approximately 28.8 million and 0.3 million respectively, for the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. 
 
 C ASH F LOWS As of and For the First Quarters Ended, (In thousands) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (14,660) (39,068) Net cash used in investing activities (6,236) (8,015) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (2,249) 65,000 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (22,398) 17,806 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 158,123 89,369 
 Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 22.4 million from June 28, 2024 to September 27, 2024, as the result of 14.7 million of cash used in operating activities, 6.2 million invested in purchases of property and equipment, and 2.2 million of cash paid in deferred financing and offering costs.

Operating Activities 
 During the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, we had an outflow of 14.7 million in cash from operating activities compared to a 39.1 million outflow during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. The lower outflow during the first quarter ended September 27, 2024 was primarily due to a higher inflow from deferred revenues and customer advances of 19.5 million, a lower net loss of 19.2 million, an income tax refund received of 1.0 million as compared to income tax payments of 13.9 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023, and a 13.7 million reduced outflow of inventory. This activity was partially offset by a 6.1 million outflow from accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings as compared to a 27.0 million inflow during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023 and a 14.0 million higher outflow from accounts payable, accrued expenses, and accrued compensation. The first quarter ended September 29, 2023 also included a 7.4 million inflow from the cash settlement for the termination of the interest rate swap. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, we invested 6.2 million, a decrease of 1.8 million, as compared to 8.0 million during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023 due to lower purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the first quarter ended September 27, 2024, we had no additional borrowings on our Revolver as compared to 65.0 million of borrowings during the first quarter ended September 29, 2023. The first quarter ended September 27, 2024, included 2.2 million of cash paid in deferred financing in conjunction with the amendment to our Revolver during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 C OMMITMENTS, C ONTRACTUAL O BLIGATIONS AND C ONTINGENCIES 
 The following is a schedule of our commitments and contractual obligations outstanding at September 27, 2024: (In thousands) Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Purchase obligations 120,574 120,574 Operating leases 85,590 15,455 27,035 22,762 20,338 206,164 136,029 27,035 22,762 20,338 
 Purchase obligations represent open non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory components and services used in normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements are for less than one year and aggregated approxi mately 120.6 million at September 27, 2024. 
 We have a liability at September 27, 2024 of 7.7 million for uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in various income tax returns. We do not know the ultimate resolution on these uncertain tax positions and as such, do not know the ultimate timing of payments or amount, if any, related to this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the above table. 
 Our standard product sales and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which we indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to our products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements. The potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances, unlimited. 
 As part of our strategy for growth, we continue to explore acquisitions or strategic alliances. The associated acquisition costs incurred in the form of professional fees and services may be material to the future periods in which they occur, regardless of whether the acquisition is ultimately completed. 
 We may elect from time to time to purchase and subsequently retire shares of common stock in order to settle employees tax liabilities associated with vesting of a restricted stock award. These transactions would be treated as a use of cash in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 O FF - BALANCE S HEET A RRANGEMENTS 
 Other than certain indemnification provisions in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not consolidated in the financial statements. Additionally, we do not have an interest in, or relationships with, any special purpose entities.

N ON -G AAP F INANCIAL M EASURES 
 In our periodic communications, we discuss certain important measures that are not calculated according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before other non-operating adjustments, interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, financing and other third party costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, COVID related expenses, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. We use adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. We use adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors, determining the portion of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations and allocating resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. We believe that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance, relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We believe that trends in our adjusted EBITDA are valuable indicators of our operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted EBITDA financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. 
 30 

The following table reconciles our net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to our adjusted EBITDA: 
 First Quarters Ended (In thousands) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net loss (17,525) (36,708) Other non-operating adjustments, net (1,735) 731 Interest expense, net 8,362 7,760 Income tax benefit (5,594) (13,027) Depreciation 9,985 10,145 Amortization of intangible assets 11,235 12,547 Restructuring and other charges 2,260 9,546 Impairment of long-lived assets Acquisition, financing and other third party costs 2,331 1,332 Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 177 177 Litigation and settlement expense, net 1,394 503 Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 10,560 8,951 Adjusted EBITDA 21,450 1,957 
 Adjusted income and adjusted EPS exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We use these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. We define adjusted income as net income before other non-operating adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, financing and other third party costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, litigation and settlement income and expense, and stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense. The impact to income taxes includes the impact to the effective tax rate, current tax provision and deferred tax provision. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
 Adjusted income and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. 
 31 

The following table reconciles net loss and diluted loss per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, to adjusted (loss) income and adjusted EPS: 
 First Quarters Ended (In thousands, except per share data) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net loss and loss per share (17,525) (0.30) (36,708) (0.64) Other non-operating adjustments, net (1,735) 731 Amortization of intangible assets 11,235 12,547 Restructuring and other charges 2,260 9,546 Impairment of long-lived assets Acquisition, financing and other third party costs 2,331 1,332 Fair value adjustments from purchase accounting 177 177 Litigation and settlement expense, net 1,394 503 Stock-based and other non-cash compensation expense 10,560 8,951 Impact to income taxes (1) 
 (6,253) (10,758) Adjusted income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (2) 
 2,444 0.04 (13,679) (0.24) Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding 58,585 57,105 (1) Impact to income taxes is calculated by recasting income before income taxes to include the items involved in determining adjusted income and recalculating the income tax provision using this adjusted income from operations before income taxes. The recalculation also adjusts for any discrete tax expense or benefit related to the items. (2) Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using diluted shares whereas Net loss per share or Adjusted loss per share is calculated using basic shares. There was no impact to the calculation of adjusted earnings per share as a result of this for the first quarters ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023. 
 
 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure for reporting cash flow, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment, which includes capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on cash available for investments and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. We believe that trends in our free cash flow can be valuable indicators of our operating performance and liquidity. 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenditures similar to the free cash flow adjustment described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these expenditures reflect all of our obligations which require cash. 
 The following table reconciles cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow: 
 First Quarters Ended (In thousands) September 27, 2024 September 29, 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (14,660) (39,068) Purchase of property and equipment (6,236) (8,015) Free cash flow (20,896) (47,083)

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There were no material changes in our exposure to market risk from June 28, 2024 to September 27, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 27, 2024. We continue to review our disclosure controls and procedures and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our Company s business. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 27, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to those matters currently pending against us and intend to defend ourself vigorously. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, or financial position. 
 On December 7, 2021, counsel for National Technical Systems, Inc. NTS sent us an environmental demand letter pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A, and CERCLA 42 U.S.C. Section 9601, related to a site that NTS formerly owned at 533 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts. NTS received a Notice of Responsibility from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection MassDEP alleging trichloroethene, freon and 1,4-dioxane contamination in the groundwater emanating from NTS s former site. NTS alleges in its demand letter that the operations of a predecessor company to Mercury that was acquired in our acquisition of the Microsemi Carve-Out Business that once owned and operated a facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts contributed to the groundwater contamination. NTS is seeking payment from us of NTS s costs for any required environmental remediation. In April 2022, we engaged in a meet and confer session with NTS pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 21E, Section 4A to discuss the status of the environmental review performed by NTS and its licensed site professional. We subsequently delivered a letter to NTS outlining the deficiencies in their claim and reiterated that we are not obligated to tender a substantive response to their demand without first having received the responsive information requested in connection with the meet and confer session. In April 2024, counsel for NTS sent additional communications on their demand that we participate in their environmental monitoring and remediation planning, and in May 2024, we responded with a rebuttal of the allegations. We believe the NTS claims are without merit and intend to defend our self vigorously. In addition, in November 2021, we responded to a request for information from MassDEP regarding the detection of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroakyl substances) in the Acton, Massachusetts Water District s Conant public water supply wells near the former facility at 531 Main Street, Acton, Massachusetts at a level above the standard that MassDEP published for PFAS in October 2020. We have not been contacted by MassDEP since our response was provided in November 2021. It is too early to determine what responsibility, if any, we may have for these environmental matters. 
 On June 19, 2023, our Board of Directors received notice of our former CEO s resignation from his positions of President and Chief Executive Officer. The Board accepted his resignation effective June 24, 2023. In his notice, the former CEO claimed he was entitled to certain benefits, including equity vesting, severance, and other benefits, under his change in control severance agreement (the CIC Agreement because he had resigned with good reason during a potential change in control period. We dispute these claims and maintain that he resigned without good reason. On September 19, 2023, our former CEO filed for binding arbitration under the employment rules of the American Arbitration Association AAA ). An arbitrator was appointed on November 29, 2023, and an arbitration trial that was initially scheduled for mid-December 2024 has been rescheduled to late March 2025. On March 25, 2024, the arbitrator denied Mr. Aslett s motion for compensation during the dispute and payment of his legal fees, preserving those matters for the arbitration trial. We intend to contest vigorously the claims under the CIC Agreement and believe that we have strong arguments that our former CEO s claims lack merit. If the arbitrator rules in our favor, we may still need to pay the former CEO s reasonable legal fees, interest, and compensation during the dispute. If instead the arbitrator rules for the former CEO, we could be liable for up to approximately 14.1 million, based on the closing price of our common stock on June 26, 2023, for accelerated equity vesting, severance and other benefits under the CIC Agreement, plus interest, legal fees and expenses and compensation during dispute, which could include Mr. Aslett's base salary and other amounts based on the compensation, benefit and insurance plans in which he participated. We categorically deny any wrongdoing or liability under the CIC Agreement, but the outcome of potential arbitration is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that we will incur a liability in this matter, and we estimate the potential range of exposure from 0 to 14.1 million, plus costs and attorneys fees, interest, and compensation to our former CEO during the dispute. 
 On December 13, 2023, a securities class action complaint was filed against us, Mark Aslett, and Michael Ruppert in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint asserted Section 10(b) and 20(a) securities fraud claims on behalf of a purported class of purchasers and sellers of our stock from December 7, 2020, through June 23, 2023. The complaint alleged that our public disclosures in SEC filings and on earnings calls were false and/or misleading. On February 27, 2024, the Court entered an order appointing Carpenters Pension Trust Fund for Northern California as lead plaintiff. On April 18, 2024, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint including William Ballhaus and David Farnsworth as additional defendants and amended the class period to February 3, 2021 through February 6, 2024. We filed a motion to dismiss on May 24, 2024, and after the plaintiffs filed their opposition motion and we filed our reply to their opposition, a hearing on the motion was conducted by the Court on July 24, 2024. On July 24, 2024, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice and permitted the plaintiffs 30 days to file an amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed for leave to amend their complaint on August 23, 2024, Mercury filed its opposition motion on September 6th, the plaintiffs filed their response brief on September 17th, and Mercury filed our reply on September 30th. On October 17, 2024, Mercury received a shareholder derivative demand alleging the same 
 34 

claims as those covered in the federal securities class action. Subject to the terms of our by-laws and applicable Massachusetts law, Mr. Aslett, our former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ruppert, our former Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ballhaus, our current Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Farnsworth, our current Chief Financial officer, are indemnified by us for this matter. We believe the claims in the complaints are without merit and intend to defend our self vigorously. It is too early to determine what responsibility, if any, we will have for this matter. 
 On January 31, 2024, a former employee at our Torrance, California location, filed a wage and hour class action lawsuit in California state court in Los Angeles County, along with a companion Private Attorneys General Act PAGA lawsuit, to act in a representative capacity for other Mercury Mission Systems, LLC employees in California, alleging a range of violations of California wage and hour regulations. On October 1, 2024, a second former employee at our Torrance location filed a PAGA notice to act in a representative capacity on allegations of a range of violations of California wage and hour regulations. We believe the claims in the complaints are without merit and intend to defend our self vigorously. It is too early to determine what responsibility, if any, Mercury will have for this matter. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under Item 1A (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024. There has been no changes from the factors disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on August 13, 2024, although we may disclose additional changes to such factors from time to time in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
