Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements relating to our expectations, projections, beliefs, and prospects, which are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as anticipate, expect, intend, plan, goal, projects, believes, seeks, estimates, "forecast," "target," predict, future, may, can, will, would or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. You should read these statements carefully because they may relate to future expectations around growth, strategy and anticipated trends in our business, contain projections of future results of operations or financial condition or state other forward-looking information. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions, and projections about future events and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified herein, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted include, but are not limited to: 
 our expectations regarding our ability to address market and customer demands and to timely develop new or enhanced solutions to meet those demands; 
 anticipated trends, challenges and growth in our business and the markets in which we operate, including pricing expectations; 
 our expectations regarding our revenue, revenue mix, average selling prices, gross margin, and expenses; 
 our expectations regarding dependence on a limited number of customers and end customers; 
 our customer relationships and our ability to retain and expand our customer relationships and to achieve design wins; 
 our expectations regarding the success, cost, and timing of new products; 
 the size and growth potential of the markets for our solutions, and our ability to serve and expand our presence in those markets; 
 our expectations regarding competition in our existing and future markets; 
 the impact a pandemic, epidemic, or other outbreak of disease may in the future have on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the businesses of our suppliers and customers; 
 our expectations regarding regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; 
 our expectations regarding the performance of, and our relationships with, our third-party suppliers and manufacturers; 
 our expectations regarding our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and 
 the accuracy of our estimates regarding capital requirements and needs for additional financing. 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements or the reasons that results could differ from these forward-looking statements. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results,

 During the six months ended November 2, 2024, the decrease in contract assets of million was primarily driven by billings for certain milestones that had been met. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The contracted but unsatisfied performance obligation was approximately million and the satisfied but unrecognized performance obligation was approximately million as of November 2, 2024 which the Company expects to recognize over the next 12 months. The Company applied a performance constraint on the satisfied but unrecognized performance obligation due to uncertainty around the collectability of milestone payments.

 2026 2027 2028 2029 Total unconditional purchase commitments 
 Technology license fees include the liabilities under agreements for technology licenses between the Company and various vendors. 
 Under the Company s manufacturing relationships with its foundry partners, cancellation of outstanding purchase orders is allowed but requires payment of all costs and expenses incurred through the date of cancellation. 
 As of November 2, 2024, the total value of non-cancelable purchase orders payable within the next one year that were committed with the Company s third-party subcontractors was approximately million. Such purchase commitments are included in the preceding table. 
 The Company has a manufacturing supply capacity reservation agreement with an assembly subcontractor as of November 2, 2024. Under this arrangement, the Company has paid refundable deposits to the supplier in exchange for reserved manufacturing production capacity over the term of the agreement, which approximates . In addition, the Company committed to certain purchase levels that were in line with the capacity reserved. If the Company does not meet the purchase level commitment, the agreement requires the Company to pay a fee equal to the difference between the actual purchase and the purchase commitment, up to the value of refundable deposits made. In the fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2024, the agreement was amended to change the purchase commitment measurement from a dollar amount to a quantity amount throughout the remaining periods. The Company estimated a dollar cost per unit using actual billings from the assembly subcontractor for the most recent calendar quarter and calculating a weighted-average cost per unit. Based on this calculation, the Company currently estimates that it has made purchase level commitments of at least million for the remainder of fiscal year 2025 through fiscal year 2028 under the capacity reservation agreement. Such purchase commitments are included in the preceding table. In addition, the Company had refundable deposits of million of which million was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million was recorded in other non-current assets on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 Warranty Obligations 
 The Company s products generally carry a standard warranty. The Company s warranty expense was not material in the periods presented. 
 Indemnifications 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into agreements that contain certain indemnification obligations of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, investors, directors, officers, employees and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, certain losses arising out of the Company s breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. These indemnification obligations may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss limitations. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification obligations. Accordingly, the Company had no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of November 2, 2024 and April 27, 2024. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company may be a party to various litigation claims in the ordinary course of business. Legal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses, in conjunction with legal counsel, the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies. Accrual estimates are recorded when and if it is determined that such a liability for litigation and contingencies are both probable and reasonably estimable.

 The Company s effective tax rate for the six months ended November 2, 2024 differs from the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the tax benefit of share-based compensation expense being offset by a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S. entity in fiscal year 2025.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview 
 Credo provides innovative, secure, high-speed and power-efficient connectivity solutions. Our solutions target the data infrastructure market, where bandwidth requirements are increasing exponentially, driven by the accelerating deployment of leading edge Artificial Intelligence infrastructure and applications. Our connectivity solutions are optimized for optical and electrical Ethernet applications, including the 100G (or Gigabits per second), 200G, 400G, 800G and emerging 1.6T (or Terabits per second) markets. Our products are based on our Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) and Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technologies. Our product families include integrated circuits (ICs), Active Electrical Cables (AECs) and SerDes Chiplets. Our intellectual property (IP) solutions consist primarily of SerDes IP licensing. 
 Data generation has increased dramatically over the past ten years, creating new and complicated challenges in both circuit and system design. Our proprietary SerDes and DSP technologies enable us to achieve similar performance to leading competitors products but at a lower cost and more highly available legacy node (n-1 advantage). Beyond power and performance, Credo continues to innovate to address customers system level requirements. We partner with Microsoft on our HiWire Switch AEC and open-source implementation that helps realize Microsoft s vision for a highly reliable network-managed dual-Top-of-Rack (ToR) architecture (a network architecture design in which computing equipment located within the same or an adjacent rack are, for redundancy, connected to two in-rack network switches, which are, in turn, connected to aggregation switches via fiber optic cables), overcome complex and slow legacy enterprise approaches, simplify deployment and improve connection reliability in the data center. 
 The multibillion-dollar data infrastructure market that we serve is driven largely by hyperscale data centers (hyperscalers), as well as general compute, AI/ML infrastructure, multi-service operators (MSOs), and mobile network operators (MNOs). The demands for increased bandwidth, improved power and cost efficiency and heightened security have simultaneously and dramatically expanded as work, education and entertainment have rapidly digitized across myriad endpoint users. 
 We design, market and sell both product and IP solutions. We help define industry conventions and standards within the markets we target by collaborating with technology leaders and standards bodies. We contract with a variety of manufacturing partners to build our products based on our proprietary SerDes and DSP technologies. We develop standard solutions we can sell broadly to our end markets and also develop tailored solutions designed to address specific customer needs. Once developed, these tailored solutions can generally be broadly leveraged across our portfolio and we are able to sell the part or license the IP to the broader market. 
 During the three and six months ended November 2, 2024, we generated 72.0 million and 131.7 million in total revenue, respectively, and during the three and six months ended October 28, 2023, we generated 44.0 million and 79.1 million in total revenue, respectively. Product sales and product engineering services revenue comprised 95.9 of our total revenue in both the three and six months ended November 2, 2024 and 83.3 and 87.2 in the three and six months ended October 28, 2023, respectively, and IP license revenue represented 4.1 of our total revenue in both the three and six months ended November 2, 2024 and 16.7 and 12.8 in the three and six months ended October 28, 2023, respectively. During the three and six months ended November 2, 2024, we generated 4.2 million and 13.8 million in net losses, respectively, and during the three and six months ended October 28, 2023, we generated 6.6 million and 18.3 million in net losses, respectively. 
 We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers. We anticipate we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future. We expect that as our products are more widely adopted and as our number of customers increase, customer concentration will decrease. 
 20 

We sell our products to hyperscalers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs) and optical module manufacturers, as well as to companies in the enterprise and HPC markets. We work closely and have engagements with industry-leading companies across these segments. A relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for and continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. We report revenue by customer in our financial statement disclosure based on the contracting parties who place purchase orders or sign revenue contracts with us. See Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. However, certain of our end customers have their contract manufacturing partners place orders with us. As a result, the contract manufacturers, rather than the end customers, are reported as our customers for financial reporting purposes. As a supplement to our financial statement footnote disclosure, and to provide further insight into our end customer concentration, the following table summarizes our revenue by customer as a percentage of total revenue based on end customer profile, rather than based on the contracting parties who place purchase orders or sign revenue contracts with us:

 Our Business Model 
 We are a product-focused business with a strong foundation in IP, pioneering comprehensive connectivity solutions that deliver bandwidth, scalability and end-to-end signal integrity for next-generation platforms. We also develop IP solutions to address the specific and complex needs of our customers. We earn revenue from these IP solutions primarily through licensing fees and royalties. In addition to product sales and IP license revenue, we also generate revenue from providing engineering services as part of our product and license arrangements with certain customers. Over time, we expect to generate an increased proportion of our revenue from sales of our products. We expect to see a long-term benefit from improvements in our operating leverage as our business continues to gain scale. 
 We utilize a fabless business model, working with a network of third parties to manufacture, assemble and test our connectivity products. This approach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our core competencies and to control our fixed costs and capital expenditures. 
 We employ a two-pronged sales strategy targeting both the end users of our products, as well as the suppliers of our end users. By engaging directly with the end user, we are able to better understand the needs of our customers and cater our solutions to their most pressing connectivity requirements. 
 This strategy has enabled us to become the preferred vendor to a number of our customers who, in turn, in some cases, require their suppliers, OEMs, ODMs and optical module manufacturers to utilize our solutions.

 292 450 (35.1) 914 (87) (1,150.6) of total revenue 0.4 1.0 0.7 (0.1) 
 Provision for income taxes for the three months ended November 2, 2024 remained consistent, decreasing by 0.2 million, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2024. 
 Provision for income taxes for the six months ended November 2, 2024 increased by 1.0 million, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2024. The fluctuation was primarily due to the tax benefit of share-based compensation expense being offset by a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the U.S. entity in fiscal year 2025. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our activities consist primarily of selling our products, licensing our IP, providing product and IP engineering services, and conducting research and development of our products and technology. As of November 2, 2024 and April 27, 2024, we had 239.2 million and 66.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and working capital of 488.6 million and 485.6 million, respectively. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations and invest in research and development to support our growth. See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our cash requirements under non-cancelable purchase obligations. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and other components of working capital will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and in the longer term. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, customer demand and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. In the event that we need to borrow funds or issue additional equity, we cannot be assured that any such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated. 
 Six Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 
 3,049 29,616 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 171,534 (9,655) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 (2,422) 664 
 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 3.0 million for the six months ended November 2, 2024. The cash inflows from operating activities for the six months ended November 2, 2024 were primarily due to 50.6 million of non-cash items, partially offset by 33.7 million of cash outflows for working capital purposes and 13.8 million in net loss. The cash outflows from working capital for the six months ended November 2, 2024 were primarily driven by (a) an increase in accounts receivable of 22.1 million primarily due to large billings from customers not due yet in the six months ended November 2, 2024; (b) an increase in inventory of 12.6 million to support unfulfilled backlog and related new product ramps; and (c) a decrease in deferred revenue of 2.0 million due to the satisfaction of performance obligations over the passage of time. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 29.6 million for the six months ended October 28, 2023. The cash inflows from operating activities for the six months ended October 28, 2023 were primarily due to 23.7 million of cash inflows for working capital purposes and 24.3 million of non-cash items, partially offset by 18.3 million in net loss. 
 25 

The cash inflows from working capital for the six months ended October 28, 2023 were primarily driven by (a) an decrease in accounts receivable of 16.8 million primarily due to collection of large customer invoices in the fiscal quarter ended October 28, 2023; (b) an decrease in inventory of 9.6 million primarily driven by tightened production management and increased product sales compared to the fiscal quarter ended April 29, 2023; (c) an increase in accounts payable of 5.6 million due to amounts payable relating to increased research and development spending. These cash inflows were offset by cash outflows relating to an increase in other non-current assets of 4.6 million primarily relating to payments of refundable deposits for a manufacturing supply capacity reservation agreement. 
 Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities of 171.5 million in the six months ended November 2, 2024 was primarily attributable to maturities of certificates of deposit for 313.1 million, offset by purchases of the same for 113.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of 27.8 million. Purchases of property and equipment primarily related to mask set costs capitalized relating to the Company s products already introduced or to be introduced, and third-party IP licenses and computer equipment and software used for research and development purposes. 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 9.7 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023 was attributable to purchases of property and equipment of 7.4 million and net outflow from certificates of deposit of 2.3 million from maturities of certificates of deposit for 109.2 million and purchases of the same for 111.5 million. Purchases of property and equipment primarily related to mask sets purchases for new products introduced or in process of being introduced, and computer equipment and software used for research and development purposes. 
 Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities of 2.4 million for the six months ended November 2, 2024 was primarily attributable to 4.6 million in payments for long-term technology license obligations and 2.3 million tax withheld related to RSU settlement, offset by 4.4 million in proceeds from exercises of employee share options. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 0.7 million for the six months ended October 28, 2023 was solely attributable to 3.7 million in proceeds from exercises of employee share options and issuances of shares under the ESPP offset by 3.1 million in payments for long-term technology license obligations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three and six months ended November 2, 2024, as compared to those disclosed under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024. In the current macroeconomic environment, our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. We continue to monitor and assess our estimates in light of developments, and as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 For a discussion of market risks, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024. During the three and six months ended November 2, 2024, there were no material changes or developments that would materially alter the market risk assessment performed as of April 27, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 26 

Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the quarter ended November 2, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Credo have been detected. 
 27 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on us. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our ordinary shares. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2024.

13. ERISA Rights . Participants in the Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd Executive Change in Control Severance Plan have certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA ). ERISA provides that Participants are entitled to

 13 

13.2. obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the Plan, including a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. 
 14. Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries . In addition to creating rights for Participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The people who operate the Plan, called fiduciaries, have a duty to administer the Plan prudently and solely in the interest of the Participants and beneficiaries. No one, including an Employer, or any other person, may fire a Participant or otherwise discriminate against any Participant in any way to prevent a Participant from obtaining a benefit or exercising a Participant s rights under ERISA. 
 15. Filing a Claim . If a Participant disagrees with the determination or payment of such Participant s benefits, or if a Participant has any questions about receiving these benefits, such Participant should contact the Plan Administrator in writing at the address set forth in the Plan Information above. 
 16. Time Frame for Claim Determinations Regarding Benefits . If a Participant receives an adverse benefit determination (i.e., any denial, reduction, or termination of a benefit, or a failure to provide or make a payment), the Plan Administrator will notify the Participant of the adverse determination within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 90 days after receiving such Participant s written claim. This 90-day period may be extended for up to an additional 90 days if the Plan Administrator (i) determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, and (ii) notifies the Participant, before the initial 90-day period expires, of the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a determination. In the event an extension is necessary due to a Participant s failure to submit necessary information, the Plan s time frame for making a benefit determination on review is stopped from the date the Plan Administrator sends the Participant the extension notification until the date the Participant responds to the request for additional information. 
 17. If a Participant Receives an Adverse Benefit Determination . The Plan Administrator will provide a Participant with a notification of any adverse benefit determination that will set forth 
 17.1. the specific reason(s) for the adverse benefit determination 
 17.2. reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the benefit determination is based 
 17.3. a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Participant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why that material or information is necessary and 
 17.4. a description of the Plan s appeal procedures and time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the Participant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA after an adverse determination on appeal to the Plan Administrator. 
 18. Procedures for Appealing an Adverse Benefit Determination . A Participant, or a Participant s authorized representative, has 60 days following the receipt of a notification of an adverse benefit determination within which to appeal the determination. A Participant has the right to 
 14 

18.1. submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim for benefits 
 18.2. request reasonable access to, and copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the Participant s claim for benefits. Note that a reasonable charge will be made for copies of the Plan document. For this purpose, a document, record, or other information is treated as relevant to a claim if it 
 18.2.1. was relied upon in making the benefit determination 
 18.2.2. was submitted, considered, or generated in the course of making the benefit determination, regardless of whether such document, record or other information was relied upon in making the benefit determination or 
 18.2.3. demonstrates compliance with the administrative processes and safeguards required in making the benefit determination and 
 18.3. a review that takes into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Participant relating to the claim, regardless of whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. 
 The Plan Administrator will notify the Participant of the Plan s benefit determination on review within a reasonable period of time, but not later than 60 days after receipt of the Participant s request for review by the Plan. This 60-day period may be extended for up to an additional 60 days if the Plan Administrator both determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, and notifies the Participant, before the initial 60-day period expires, of the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a determination on review. 
 In the event that an extension is necessary due to the Participant s failure to submit necessary information, the Plan s time frame for making a benefit determination on review is stopped from the date the Plan Administrator sends the Participant the extension notification until the date such Participant responds to the request for additional information. 
 The Plan Administrator s notice of an adverse benefit determination on appeal will contain all of the following information 
 (a) the specific reason(s) for the adverse benefit determination 
 (b) reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the benefit determination is based 
 (c) a statement that the Participant is entitled to receive, upon request, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the Participant s claim. Note that a reasonable charge will be made for copies of the Plan document and 
 (d) a statement describing the Participant s right to obtain the information about such procedures, and a statement of the Participant s right to bring an action under ERISA. 
 15 

The Participant must exhaust the Plan s administrative claims and appeals procedure before bringing a suit in either state or federal court. Similarly, failure to follow the Plan s prescribed procedures in a timely manner will also cause the Participant to lose the Participant s right to sue regarding an adverse benefit determination. 
 19. Assistance with Questions . If the Participant has any questions about the Plan, the Participant should contact the Plan Administrator. If the Participant has any questions about this statement or about the Participant s rights under ERISA, or if the Participant needs assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, the Participant should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210. The Participant may also obtain certain publications about the Participant s rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.
