and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an inventory prepayment in the amount of and , respectively, related to down payments for eyewear purchased from the manufacturer, prior to shipment of the product that occurred after the respective balance sheet dates. 

to research and development expense. 

For stock option awards, the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and share price volatility. 

The expected term of the stock options is estimated based on the simplified method as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. 

The share price volatility is estimated using historical stock prices based upon the expected term of the options granted, using stock prices of comparably profiled public companies. 

The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. 

For awards of restricted stock units and shares of common stock, the fair value of the award is based on the quoted market price of our common shares on the NASDAQ stock exchange. 

of revenue for each period, that was included in the contract liability balances as of January 1, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

All revenue, including sales processed online and through our retail store resellers and distributors, is reported net of sales taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities, returns, and discounts. Amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenues; costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold at the time the related revenue is recognized. 

For sales generated through our e-commerce channels, we identify the contract with a customer upon online purchase of our eyewear and transaction price at the manufacturer suggested retail price MSRP for non-prescription, polarized sunglass and blue light blocking glasses across all of our online channels. Our e-commerce revenue is recognized upon meeting of the performance obligation when the eyewear is shipped to end customers. U.S. consumers enjoy free USPS first class postage on orders over 149, with faster delivery options available for extra cost, for sales processed through our website. For Amazon sales, shipping is free for U.S. consumers while international customers pay shipping charges on top of MSRP. Any costs associated with fees charged by the online platforms (Shopify for Lucyd.co website and Amazon) are not recharged to customers and are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold as incurred. The Company charges applicable state sales taxes in addition to the MSRP for both online channels and all other marketplaces on which the company sells products. 

For sales to our retail store partners, we identify the contract with a customer upon receipt of an order of our eyewear through our Shopify wholesale portal or direct purchase order. Revenue is recognized upon meeting the performance obligation, which is delivery of the Company s eyewear products to the retail store, and is also recorded net of returns and discounts. Our wholesale pricing for eyewear sold to retail store partners includes volume discounts, due to the nature of large quantity orders. The pricing includes shipping charges, while excluding any state sales tax charges applicable. Due to the nature of wholesale retail orders, no e-commerce fees are applicable. 

For sales to distributors, we identify the contract with a customer upon receipt of an order of our eyewear through a direct purchase order. If collectibility of substantially all of the contract consideration is probable, revenue is recognized upon meeting the performance obligation, which is delivery of our eyewear products to the distributor, and is also recorded net of returns and discounts. Our wholesale pricing for eyewear sold to retail store partners and distributors includes volume discounts, due to the nature of large quantity orders. The pricing does not include shipping. Due to the nature of wholesale retail orders, no marketplace fees are applicable, only credit card processing fees. 

For sales of subscriptions to the Pro version of our Lucyd app, we identify the individual contracts with customers through detailed transaction reports from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, with each individual transaction representing a separate contract. Revenue is recognized upon meeting the performance obligation, which is the right and availability of each customer to access the Pro features of the Lucyd app. For those customers that purchase such access on a month-to-month basis, we recognize revenue in the month in which the purchase of such access is made. For those customers which purchase an annual subscription, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period, using a mid-month convention. The balance of unearned revenue related to app subscriptions that has been deferred on our balance sheet as a contract liability was as of September 30, 2024. 

We allow our customers to return our physical products, subject to our refund policy, which allows any customer to return our physical products for any reason and receive a full refund for frames (prescription lenses excluded) within the first 7 days for sales made through our website (Lucyd.co), 30 days for sales made through Amazon, and 30 days for sales to most wholesale retailers and distributors (although certain sales to independent distributors are ineligible for returns). As of January 2024, we updated our return policy to prohibit discretionary returns of prescription lenses, and also instituted a standard restocking fee for standard frame returns, which is deducted from applicable refunds to cover shipping and restocking costs. 

For all of our product sales, at the time of sale, we establish a reserve for returns, based on historical experience and expected future returns, which is recorded as a reduction of sales. Additionally, we review all individual returns received in the month following the balance sheet date pertaining to orders processed prior to the balance sheet date in order to determine whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary. The Company recorded an allowance for sales returns of and as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

t recorded an income tax provision or benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as it maintains a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets.

Rights Plan 

 On September 25, 2024, our board of directors approved the adoption of a limited duration stockholder rights plan (the Rights Plan ), and declared a dividend to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 25, 2024 of one common stock purchase right (a Right for each outstanding share of our common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company six shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share. The Rights are evidenced by and trade with the certificates for the shares of our common stock outstanding as of September 25, 2024, and will accompany any new shares of our common stock that are issued after that date. 

Under the Rights Plan, the Rights generally will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 or more of our common stock in a transaction not approved by our board of directors. In that situation, each holder of a Right (other than the acquiring person or group, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) will have the right to purchase, upon payment of the exercise price and in accordance with the terms of the Rights Plan, a number of shares of our common stock having a market value of twice such price.

I tem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Overview 

Our mission is to Upgrade Your Eyewear . We develop and sell cutting-edge smart eyeglasses and sunglasses, which are designed to allow our customers to remain connected to their digital lives, while also offering vision correction and protection. Our smart eyewear is a fusion of headphones with glasses, bringing vision correction and protection together with digital connectivity and clear audio, while also offering a safer solution for listening to music outdoors (as compared to in-ear headphones). The convenience of having a Bluetooth headset and comfortable glasses in one, especially for those who are already accustomed to all-day eyewear use, offers a lifestyle upgrade at a price most consumers can afford. 

Our flagship product, Lucyd Lyte , enables the wearer to listen to music, take and make calls, and use voice assistants and ChatGPT to perform many common smartphone tasks hands-free. Notably, by the end of the first quarter of 2025 the Company anticipates completing its mission to introduce a smart upgrade for all four of the major types of eyewear: prescription eyeglasses, ready-to-wear sunglasses, safety glasses, and sport glasses. We believe this will expand our customer base significantly by having a large eyeglass and sunglass offering that better aligns with the needs of optical retailers. To date, most Lucyd products have been designed for sunglass use, but starting in 2024 we have begun to offer alternative lens options such as blue light and transitional lenses on our stock frames, allowing for more customization without increasing unit price. Additionally, the Lucyd Armor and Reebok Powered by Lucyd frames will align with the style and performance needs of safety and sport eyewear users respectively, for which we have not previously had a suitable product offering. 

The Company believes its diversification into safety and sport smartglasses (Lucyd Armor and Reebok ), for which high-quality competing products are scarce, will buttress our position in the emerging smart eyewear market by offering a unique value proposition to customers. Since these products are very competitively priced against their traditional counterparts, we believe in their potential to enhance the Company s revenues and open new retail partnerships with businesses outside of the optical market. 

Products and History 

In January 2020, we introduced our first beta product and began market testing. 

In January 2021, we officially launched our first commercial product, Lucyd Lyte. This initial product offering embodied our goal of creating smart eyewear for all-day wear that looks like and is priced similarly to designer eyewear, but is also lightweight and comfortable, and enables the wearer to remain connected to their digital lives. The product was initially launched with six styles, and in September 2021, an additional six styles were added, including the Company s first titanium-front smart eyewear. A final four styles were added to this collection in 2022, including the Company s first matte finish and tortoise style models, along with improvements to hinge design. 

In the first quarter of 2022 we introduced a virtual try-on kiosk for select retail stores. This device introduces our products to prospective retail customers and enables them to digitally try-on our line of smart glasses in a touch-free manner. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed development of core audio eyewear product improvements, such as upgrading all frames to quadraphonic sound, which was subsequently rolled out across all of our new eyewear models. 

In February 2023, we launched version 2.0 of our Lucyd Lyte eyewear with 15 different styles, incorporating several key breakthroughs for the smart eyewear product category including a four-speaker audio array, 12-hour music playback and call time, and improved styling as well as technical upgrades. In October 2023, we launched six new styles of smart eyewear, branded as Lyte XL, bringing even more advancements including patent-pending flexible hinges for a more comfortable fit and a wider range of suitable head sizes, significant improvements to speaker and microphone quality, thinner and more ergonomic temples, and post-consumer recycled packaging. 

18 

Also during 2023, we completed upgrades to our accessory products, including the charging dock and virtual try-on kiosk. The patent-pending Lucyd charging dock was upgraded to version 2.0 edition, featuring auto-adjusting connectors to fit any size of smart eyewear we produce, a new charging status LED, and USB data capability, enabling it to be used as a USB hub for computers in addition to a charging hub. The Lucyd virtual try-on kiosk was replaced with a fully modular display system, with eight available components for stores to mix and match to suit their display needs. The display can be deployed as a countertop display or freestanding, making it suitable for almost any retail environment. 

In January 2024, we launched the Nautica Powered by Lucyd smart eyewear collection in eight different styles, along with various branded accessories including a power brick, cleaning cloth, and a slipcase adorned with the iconic Nautica sail logo. This collection introduced the Company s first global fit style, which supports low nose bridge customers. 

In April 2024, we launched the Eddie Bauer Powered by Lucyd smart eyewear collection in four different styles, which showcases the first-to-market rimless smart eyewear design. We believe the Eddie Bauer collection is the Company s most premium product to date, and features brushed titanium hardware, improved sound quality, and includes the patent-pending Lucyd Dock with every unit. 

In October 2024, we launched the Lucyd Armor line, an ANSI-certified smart safety glass designed for all-day wear. This new line provides all the powerful features of Lucyd eyewear in a stylish safety wrap. 

With the addition of the Lucyd Armor line, our current product offering consists of 34 different models, which offers a similar amount of style variety as many traditional eyewear collections. The Company is continuously iterating and improving its frame lineup, offering a mixture of Lucyd icons (styles that have consistently performed well since the introduction of Lucyd Lyte) and new styles seasonally to align with market trends and evolving consumer demand. All styles are available with 80+ different lens types, resulting in thousands of variations of products currently available. The Company currently has over 100 licensed patents and applications. 

We plan to launch the Reebok Powered by Lucyd sport smart glasses collection in the first quarter of 2025, followed by a Reebok Optical Smart Eyewear collection in mid-2025. 

Since the initial launch of Lucyd Lyte, we have witnessed growing interest and demand from customers throughout the United States and have sold thousands of our smart glasses. Over the past few years, numerous optical stores in the United States and Canada have onboarded our products, and we continue to pursue expansion with various large eyewear chains and other large retailers regarding our frames. We believe smart eyewear is a product category whose time has come, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on and help develop this exciting new sector where eyewear meets electronics in a user-friendly, mass market format, priced similarly to designer eyewear. 

Software and Apps 

In April 2023, we introduced a major software upgrade for our glasses with the launch of the Lucyd app for iOS and Android. This free application enables the user to converse with the extremely popular ChatGPT AI language model on our glasses, to instantly gain the benefit of one of the world s most powerful AI assistants in a hands-free ergonomic interface. The app deploys a powerful and unique Siri integration with the Open AI API for ChatGPT, developed internally by the Company. The Company has filed a patent application related to this software. 

In the second quarter of 2024, we added a Pro version of the app, which provides unlimited ChatGPT interactions and priority tech support for a modest monthly or annual fee. This is a new revenue stream for our business, and represents our first diversification in product revenue from frames and lenses. 

In July 2024, we launched a new feature called Walkie for the Lucyd app, which enables thousands of users to join each other on walkie-talkie style communication channels. This feature was designed with the upcoming smart safety glass product in mind, to enable coworking teams to communicate freely on smart eyewear. We plan to launch more new features for the Lucyd app in the future, such as an audio equalizer enabling the user to optimize sound output for different types of content such as calls and podcasts, a Find My Glasses feature, and touch control customizations. 

19 

We believe these developments make our Lucyd eyewear perhaps the smartest smartglasses available today, and represent a significant marketing opportunity for our core smartglass products. 

A large part of our strategy is not just to
provide a leading smart eyewear platform, but to build a highly functional mobile software and interactive retail fixture ecosystem
to support user adoption and stickiness with our products. While the Lucyd app provides additional value to end users
after purchase, we also wanted to make the purchase process itself more engaging and tech-forward. To this end, we have also
developed all-new interactive LCD retail fixtures, featuring a new proprietary kiosk app that we have just recently developed
in-house. These new displays offer a complete Lucyd experience, including virtual try-on, social media content, detailed product
info and videos, and seamless music demos. The new display systems, installed with the Lucyd shopping app, are expected to provide
an immersive onboarding experience for prospective customers in retail stores carrying our frames, and we have started deployment of
these new display systems to customers as of October 2024. 

Key Factors Affecting Performance 

Expansion of retail points of purchase 

In addition to sustained growth of our e-commerce business, we believe our future revenues are correlated positively with our placement of Lucyd glasses in optical stores, as well as sporting goods stores and other specialty stores. To support this growth, we have partnered with Windsor Eyes as our premier distributor for the optical market. Windsor Eyes brings decades of experience in the eyewear industry and a team of experienced, professional eyewear sales reps. In July 2024, they have just started to market our frames, and have already introduced our frames into three new eyewear retailers. 

We currently offer an expansive line of 34 different styles and several accessories (including our co-branded product offerings with Nautica and Eddie Bauer), and are in the process of expanding our product offerings to include co-branded eyewear with other well-known brands like Reebok. In total, the Company expects to offer 38 total smart eyewear models by the end of 2024. 

Retail store client retention and re-orders 

Our ability to sustain and increase revenue is correlated positively with our ability to receive re-orders from stores, either directly or through our wholesale distributors. To support our sales to retail stores directly, we offer a strong co-op marketing program that includes free and paid store display materials. Additionally, we consistently incorporate retail partner feedback directly into our frames to better serve our end users. 

As part of this strategy, we have launched a new modular display system with engaging video screens and audio testing capabilities for our resellers to help educate their in-store customers about Lucyd Lyte and enable customers to try them on. This proprietary display system is central to our efforts to introduce traditional retail customers to Lucyd eyewear, and we are planning further enhancements to our merchandising displays to enable more immersive experiences. As of September 30, 2024, 73 digital display systems have been deployed to retailers. In October 2024, we began shipping and deploying to customers enhanced countertop and freestanding displays with large, interactive screens
and engaging social media content. 

Investing in business growth 

We believe that people care about what they wear on their faces, and because we understand that customers have diverse preferences about the shape, size, and design of their eyewear, we aim to continuously invest in the design and development of new models in an effort to provide the consumer with a wide selection of styles, colors, and finishes. 

We are offering a strong co-op marketing program with retail stores, and intend to expand our sales, marketing, and brand ambassador teams to broaden our brand awareness and online presence. 

20 

Key Performance Indicators 

Store Count (B2B) 

We believe that one of the key indicators for our business is the number of retail stores onboarded to sell Lucyd Lyte. We started onboarding our first retail stores in June 2021. Currently, we have over 350 retail stores selling Lucyd Lyte primarily in the United States and Canada. Based on the existing demand for our products, current distribution, and recently consummated supply agreements, we anticipate that our products will be available in a significant number of new third-party retail locations in 2024. 

Customer Ratings (B2C) 

The Lucyd Lyte version 2.0 product is receiving higher ratings online compared to our previous products, indicating that customers are appreciative of improvements in product design, functionality, and build quality. Our newest Amazon launch of the Eddie Bauer Powered by Lucyd smart eyewear carries a 4.8/5 rating. This is a strong signal of positive feedback on our products that indicates our ability to grow and scale with America s largest online retailer and other platforms. 

Number of online orders (B2C) 

For our e-commerce business, we track the number of online orders as an indicator of the success of our online marketing efforts. As of September 30, 2024, we had over 20,000 cumulative total orders from customers online since inception. We believe that the addition of new styles, as well as further investment in brand awareness, product ambassadors, and influencer campaigns, will enable continued growth of online orders in the foreseeable future. We allocate a sizeable portion of our advertising expenditures towards influencer marketing programs. 

Components of Results of Operations 

Revenues 

Our revenue is primarily generated from the sales of prescription and non-prescription optical glasses and sunglasses, and shipping charges associated with these purchases, which are charged to the customer. We sell products through our retail store resellers, distributors, on our own website Lucyd.co, and on Amazon.com. We have also recently started to generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to the Pro version of our Lucyd app, which provides unlimited ChatGPT interactions and priority tech support for a modest monthly or annual fee. 

Our flagship Lucyd Lyte XL brand frames are priced at 179 on acetate models and 199 on titanium models for non-prescription glasses across all of our online channels. Our co-branded Nautica Powered by Lucyd and Eddie Bauer Powered by Lucyd frames are priced at 199 219 and 249 299, respectively. 

When adding a prescription lens upgrade to our glasses on the Lucyd.co website, the price can increase from between 40 for a basic clear prescription lens, all the way up to 449 for our proprietary Blueshift transitional blue light lenses in a progressive high index (ultra-thin) format. Glasses with prescription lenses are provided by the Company through our website Lucyd.co, while our sales through Amazon and to our retail partners only include non-prescription glasses (with rare exceptions, such as a reseller ordering a customized unit for display purposes). Lens customizations remain an important product differentiator and upselling opportunity. 

U.S. Lucyd.co consumers enjoy free USPS first class postage on orders over 149, with faster delivery options available for extra cost, for sales processed through our website. For Amazon sales, shipping is free for U.S. consumers while international customers pay shipping charges. Any costs associated with fees charged by the online platforms (Shopify for our Lucyd.co website and Amazon.com) are not recharged to customers. We charge applicable state sales taxes for online channels and all other marketplaces on which sell. 

Our wholesale pricing for eyewear sold to retail store partners and distributors includes volume discounts, due to the nature of large quantity orders. The pricing does not include shipping. Due to the nature of wholesale retail orders, no marketplace fees are applicable, only credit card processing fees. 

21 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Cost of goods sold includes the costs incurred to acquire materials, assemble, and sell our finished products. 

For retail sales placed through one of our e-commerce channels, these costs include (i) product costs stated at the lesser of cost and net realizable value and inclusive of inventory reserves, (ii) freight, import, and inspection costs, (iii) optical laboratory costs for prescription glasses, (iv) merchant fees, (v) fees paid to third-party e-commerce platforms, and (vi) cost of shipping the product to the consumer. 

For wholesale sales, these costs include (i) product costs stated at the lesser of cost and net realizable value and inclusive of inventory reserves, (ii) freight, import, and inspection costs, and (iii) credit card fees. 

When consumers place their orders directly on our website, we save approximately 12 - 15 on marketplace fees compared with orders placed through third-party platforms like Amazon and eBay. 

We expect our cost of goods sold to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to product mix, customer preferences and resulting demand, customer shipping costs, and management of our inventory and merchandise mix. 

Over time, we expect our total cost of goods sold on a per unit basis to decrease as a result of an increase in scale. Increase in scale is achieved as a result of increase in volumes from both business to consumer and business to business (retail store) orders. We continue to expand our products with line extensions and new models and broaden our presence in retail stores carrying our products. 

Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

Gross profit is net revenue less cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of net revenue. 

Our gross margin may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the cost at which we can obtain, transport, and assemble our inventory, the rate at our vendor network expands, and how effective we can be at controlling costs in any given period. Over time, we anticipate that our cost of goods sold, on a per unit basis, will decrease with scale, and this will likely have a positive impact on our gross margins. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses consist primarily of: 

general and administrative expenses that primarily include payroll and consulting expenses, IT software, legal, and other administrative expenses; 

sales and marketing expenses including cost of online advertising, marketing agency fees, influencers, trade shows, and other initiatives; 

related party management fees for a range of back-office services provided by Tekcapital; and 

research and development expenses related to (i) development of new styles and features of our smart eyewear, (ii) development and improvement of our e-commerce website, and (iii) development of software and apps for wearables. 

Interest and Other Income, Net 

Interest and other income, net, primarily includes interest, dividends, and investment returns from our investments in money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills, as well as interest income and expense related to loans with related parties.

Revenues 

Our
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 253,599, representing an increase of 14 as compared to revenues of 221,875
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase
is primarily attributable to strategic reductions in price discounts and adjustments to our pricing and Manufacturer s Suggested
Retail Price, aimed at enhancing profitability and attracting distributors to manage our wholesale channel. While the total number of
units sold remained relatively stable compared to the prior year quarter, the higher average order value and focused efforts in specific
channels contributed to the overall revenue growth. We believe these strategies reflect customers recognition of the quality and
value proposition of our recent new product launches and support our long-term growth objectives. Additionally, we believe consumer awareness
of smart eyewear is increasing, thanks in part to aggressive marketing from our main competitor, and the overall concept of our product
is becoming less of a novelty and more of an accepted mobile computing platform. 

Revenue generated through the e-commerce channel increased significantly from the prior year quarter, with net sales through our Lucyd.co website growing by 46 . 

Wholesale revenue decreased approximately 11 from the prior year quarter, largely driven by a change in our focus from small, independent retailers to major national retailers, the latter of which have slower product approval and purchasing cycles. However, we believe that focusing on introducing our product in major national retailers will have a significant positive impact on the Company s revenues in the next 3 to 18 months. 

23 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 54 of sales were processed on our online store (Lucyd.co), 22 on Amazon.com, and 23 through reseller partners, with 1 of our net revenues generated from Lucyd Pro app subscriptions. This sales channel mix positively impacted our revenue for the current quarter as compared with the prior year quarter, due to the fact we charge an additional 35 to 275 for our prescription lenses available only on Lucyd.co. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated an aggregate of 187,568 of revenue from sales of non-prescription frames and accessories, 63,459 from sales of frames with prescription lenses, and 2,572 of revenue from app subscriptions. All of the 56,194 in sales generated on Amazon.com during the current quarter were for non-prescription frames and accessories, as we only offer prescription lenses through our website. Of the 137,135 in online sales generated through Lucyd.co, 63,459 was related to frames with prescription lenses and 73,676 was related to glasses with non-prescription lenses. E-commerce sales remain to be the most material portion of our sales to date; however, out of all of our sales channels, we believe that the wholesale optical channel represents the most promising opportunity for future growth. We anticipate that as smart eyewear becomes more normalized for prescription wear, major national eye care providers will begin to onboard smart eyewear products, and we believe we are the value leader in that sector. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 42 of sales were processed on our online store (Lucyd.co), 29 on Amazon.com, and 29 with reseller partners. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 187,086 of revenue from sales of non-prescription frames and accessories, and 34,789 from sales of frames with prescription lenses. All of the 63,027 in sales generated on Amazon.com during the 2023 period were for non-prescription frames and accessories, as we only offer prescription lenses through our website. Of the 93,704 in online sales generated through Lucyd.co, 34,789 was related to frames with prescription lenses and 58,915 was related to glasses with non-prescription lenses. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Our total cost of goods sold increased to 194,255 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 141,531 for the prior year quarter. This year-over-year increase of 37 was driven by a combination of factors, including: (i.) higher cost of frames, largely attributable to the new Eddie Bauer Powered by Lucyd collection, due to the increased number of components, deluxe finishes, and materials associated with that product line, (ii.) higher shipping and logistics costs, and (iii.) the impact of certain period costs and other one-off items, most notably including approximately 44,000 of credits related to custom duties and taxes included in the prior year quarter amounts which did not recur in the current quarter. 

These increased costs were partially offset by significant decreases in lens fulfilment costs, which decreased by approximately 50 from the prior year quarter. This is primarily attributable to actions taken by management in the current year to better manage these costs, including (i.) the launch of the new Lucyd Shift and Lucyd Blueshift transitional lenses in place of branded third-party transitional lenses, offering similar functionality for a lower cost of goods, while also enabling a slightly lower cost to the customer, and (ii.) the engagement of a new lower-cost lens supplier based in Miami, Florida. 

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included the cost of frames of 107,469; cost of prescription lenses incurred with third-party vendors of 38,247; commissions, affiliate referral fees, and e-commerce platform fees of 24,413; and shipping and logistics costs of 22,512. Out of our total cost of goods sold for the current quarter of 194,255, 38,247 related to orders with prescription lenses, while 156,008 pertained to non-prescription orders. We anticipate that our cost of goods sold will improve in future periods as new products i.e., Lucyd Armor and Reebok Powered by Lucyd sourced from a new supplier are launched in the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025, respectively, as the frames for these product lines are designed differently from our other products and accordingly have fewer components, thus reducing their price. We estimate that the unit cost of these new product lines will be at least 30 lower than our Lucyd Lyte models. 

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included the cost of frames of 79,410; cost of prescription lenses incurred with third-party vendors of 76,346; period costs (credits) of approximately (44,000) related to custom duties and taxes; and other items including affiliate referral fees, e-commerce platform fees, commissions, and custom duties and importation fees for a total of 22,312. Out of our total cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 141,531, 76,346 related to orders with prescription lenses, while 65,185 pertained to non-prescription orders. 

24 

We anticipate further growth in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024, largely in part to the launch of our the new Lucyd Armor product line, along with corresponding growth in total cost of goods sold. As we continue to refine our product mix with sales data, we anticipate reducing our unit costs by focusing only on the highest volume, market-tested styles. Additionally, our new lower-cost supplier has indicated significant price breaks of up to 50 are possible as we increase unit volume, demonstrating the profit potential for Lucyd Armor and Reebok sunglasses. 

Gross Profit 

Our gross profit for the current quarter was 59,344, as compared to 80,344 for the prior year quarter. Our gross margin was 23 in the current quarter and 36 in the prior year quarter, representing a decline of approximately 13 percentage points from the prior year period. This decrease in gross profit and gross margin was primarily the result of higher cost of goods sold as a result of the factors described above, as well as the impact of period costs (credits) as described above. That said, the current quarter gross margin of 23 represents an improvement from our gross margin of 2 in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and 18 in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This indicates a positive trend, and we expect our gross margin to continue to improve given the ongoing impact of lower lens fulfilment costs coupled with the anticipated lower unit costs associated with the Lucyd Armor product line launching the fourth quarter of 2024 and the Reebok Powered by Lucyd product line launching in the first quarter of 2025. 

We believe that in the long term, the majority of our business will ultimately come from frame sales to distributors and eyewear retailers. We anticipate that the upcoming launches of new product lines in the fourth quarter of 2024 and first half of 2025 will help us progress towards our long-term goal of shifting our sales mix more towards the wholesale channel, which should bring consistent, large-scale orders with minimal marketing costs. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses increased by 9 to 1,821,407 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,677,140 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the following: 

General and administrative expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses increased
by 206,435 or 23 to 1,121,972 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 915,537 for the prior year quarter. This
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in legal costs of approximately 168,000, largely as a result of various shareholder
and equity-related matters during the current quarter. 

The Company maintains a lean staff salaried at market rates, and a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead type costs which are fixed or semi-fixed in nature (e.g., rent, compliance, legal and professional services, etc.); as such, our general and administrative expenses are not expected to scale up significantly as our revenue increases over time. 

Sales and marketing expenses 

Our sales and marketing expenses were 533,066 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 533,902 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, or essentially flat year-over-year. Compared to the prior year quarter, we spent more on events and trade shows, and less on influencers and paid ads, in the current quarter; this reflects short-term tactical shifts in our marketing approach to react to current trends and opportunities as they arise, and make smart investments in advertising and marketing spending that we believe will maximize our impact and provide for future growth. 

From a long-term perspective, while we expect that our total sales and marketing expenses will scale up to some degree as our revenue increases, we anticipate that such increases in sales and marketing expenses will be mitigated somewhat by our planned focus on growing the wholesale optical channel, which, due to the nature of that channel, inherently does not require costly marketing campaigns to acquire each customer and as a result typically carries a lower marketing cost per unit sold. Additionally, we generally expect that a retailer who is successful with our products will reorder in large quantities, also without significant marketing expenditure. 

25 

Research and development costs 

Our research and development costs decreased by 32 to 131,369 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 192,701 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to product development cycle timing. 

Related party management fee 

Our related party management fee was 35,000 for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, based on the terms of the management services agreement between us and Tekcapital. 

Other Income (Expense), net 

Total other income (expense), net in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 41,386. This amount was primarily comprised of dividends from our investments in money market funds, partially offset by other unrelated expenses. 

Total other income (expense), net in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 45,691. This amount was primarily comprised of interest, dividends, and investment returns from our investments in money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills.

Revenues 

Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 945,752, representing an increase of 76 as compared to revenues of 536,725 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to significant growth in the e-commerce channel, with net sales through our Lucyd.co website and Amazon.com increasing by approximately 190 and 45 , respectively, from the prior year nine months, while wholesale revenues declined by approximately 33 . 

26 

Overall, our revenue growth is mainly driven by our new product launches over the past year (including the Lyte XL collection in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the co-branded Nautica Powered by Lucyd and Eddie Bauer Powered by Lucyd collections in the current year period). We believe our brand partnerships play a significant role in our revenue growth by offering a more diversified product line that speaks to consumers from different demographics (for example, Nautica generally appeals to a more fashion-forward customer than Lucyd Lyte, and Eddie Bauer generally appeals to an older demographic than our other lines). Also contributing to our growth in revenues are our continued investments in marketing and advertising initiatives, as well as increased public interest and growth in smart glasses and the wearable products category. 

The decline in wholesale revenues was largely driven by a change in our focus during the current year from small, independent retailers to major national retailers, the latter of which have slower product approval and purchasing cycles. However, we believe that focusing on introducing our product in major national retailers will have a significant positive impact on the Company s revenues in the next 3 to 18 months. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 61 of sales were processed on our online store (Lucyd.co), 26 on Amazon.com, and 13 with reseller partners. This sales channel mix positively impacted our revenue for the current nine months as compared with the prior year nine months, due to the fact we charge an additional 35 to 275 for our prescription lenses available only on Lucyd.co. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated an aggregate of 687,855 of revenue from sales of non-prescription frames and accessories, 255,325 from sales of frames with prescription lenses, and 2,572 of revenue from app subscriptions. All of the 246,455 in sales generated on Amazon.com during the current nine months were for non-prescription frames and accessories, as we only offer prescription lenses through our website. Of the 575,577 in online sales generated through Lucyd.co, 255,325 was related to frames with prescription lenses and 320,252 was related to glasses with non-prescription lenses. E-commerce sales remain to be the most material portion of our sales to date; however, out of all of our sales channels, we believe that the wholesale optical channel represents the most promising opportunity for future growth. We anticipate that as smart eyewear becomes more normalized for prescription wear, major national eye care providers will begin to onboard smart eyewear products, and we believe we are the value leader in that sector. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 37 of sales were processed on our online store (Lucyd.co), 32 on Amazon, and 31 with reseller partners. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated 454,233 of revenue from sales of non-prescription frames and accessories, and 82,492 from sales of frames with prescription lenses. All of the 170,284 in sales generated on Amazon.com during the period were for non-prescription frames and accessories as we only offer prescription lenses through our website. Of the 193,591 in online sales generated through Lucyd.co, 82,492 was related to frames with prescription lenses and 111,099 was related to glasses with non-prescription lenses. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

Our total cost of goods sold increased to 824,281 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 475,906 for the prior year nine months. This year-over-year increase of 73 was comparable to our year-over-year increase in net revenue of 76 , and was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and gross sales during the current nine months as compared with the prior year comparable period. 

Cost of frames increased by approximately 90 from the prior year nine months, primarily related to the increase in sales volumes and also partially attributable to higher cost of goods sold associated with the new Eddie Bauer Powered by Lucyd collection, due to the increased number of components, deluxe finishes, and materials for that product line. 

Cost of lenses increased by approximately 49 from the prior year nine months, mainly driven by sales channel mix, as a higher relative proportion of our sales in the current nine months were through our online store (Lucyd.co), and the cost of prescription lenses attributable to this channel increased our cost of goods sold while not impacting cost of goods sold for sales realized through Amazon or retail store partners. These cost increases were partially offset by actions taken by management in the current year to better manage these costs, including (i.) the launch of the new Lucyd Shift and Lucyd Blueshift transitional lenses in place of branded third-party transitional lenses, offering similar functionality for a lower cost of goods, while also enabling a slightly lower cost to the customer, and (ii.) the engagement of a new lower-cost lens supplier based in Miami, Florida. 

27 

Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 notably included, but was not limited to, the cost of frames of 434,876; cost of prescription lenses incurred with third-party vendors of 196,030; commissions, affiliate referral fees, and e-commerce platform fees of 94,444; shipping and logistics costs of 63,180; and product certification costs of 29,100. Out of our total cost of goods sold for the current nine months of 824,281, 196,030 related to orders with prescription lenses, while 628,251 pertained to non-prescription orders. We anticipate that our cost of goods sold will improve in future periods as new products i.e., Lucyd Armor and Reebok Powered by Lucyd sourced from a new supplier are launched in the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025, respectively, as the frames for these product lines are designed differently from our other products and accordingly have fewer components, thus reducing their price. We estimate that the unit cost of these new product lines will be at least 30 lower than our Lucyd Lyte models. 

Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 notably included, but was not limited to, the cost of frames of 215,713; cost of prescription lenses incurred with third-party vendors of 131,561; commissions, affiliate referral fees, and e-commerce platform fees of 89,694; and quality assurance costs related to our products sold of 11,700. Out of our total cost of goods sold for the prior year nine months of 475,906, 131,561 related to orders with prescription lenses, while 344,345 pertained to non-prescription orders. 

We anticipate further growth in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024, largely in part to the launch of our the new Lucyd Armor product line, along with corresponding growth in total cost of goods sold. As we continue to refine our product mix with sales data, we anticipate reducing our unit costs by focusing only on the highest volume, market-tested styles. 

Gross Profit 

Our gross profit for the current nine months was 121,471, as compared to 60,819 for the prior year nine months. Our gross margin was 13 in the current nine months and 11 in the prior year nine months, representing an improvement of approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year period. 

This 100 improvement in gross profit (in absolute dollar terms) and the slight improvement in gross margins is the net result of the various factors discussed in detail above. 

We continue to work with all of suppliers and vendors to reduce our unit costs. Our gross margins during the current year period are increasing and trending in a positive direction, and we expect our gross margin to continue to improve given the ongoing impact of lower lens fulfilment costs that have started to be realized in the current quarter, coupled with the anticipated lower unit costs associated with the Lucyd Armor product line launching the fourth quarter of 2024 and the Reebok Powered by Lucyd product line launching in the first quarter of 2025. 

We believe that in the long term, the majority of our business will ultimately come from frame sales to distributors and eyewear retailers. Additionally, we anticipate that the upcoming launches of new product lines in the fourth quarter of 2024 and first half of 2025 will help us progress towards our long-term goal of shifting our sales mix more towards the wholesale channel, which carries higher margins for us. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses increased by 33 to 5,872,483 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 4,420,853 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to the following: 

General and administrative expenses 

Our general and administrative expenses increased by 23 to 3,526,217 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,877,663 for the prior year nine months. This increase was largely driven by the combination of (i) a 325,000 release payment made to a shareholder counterparty during the current nine months for the waiver of certain of that counterparty s pre-existing contractual rights related to the Company s equity offerings during the second quarter of 2024, (ii) an increase in legal costs of approximately 187,000, largely as a result of various shareholder and equity-related matters during the current year period, (iii) the cost of various licensing agreements we have entered into in order to support our co-branding initiatives and expand our patent portfolio, and (iv) higher investor relations costs. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance costs. 

28 

The Company maintains a lean staff salaried at market rates, and a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead type costs which are fixed or semi-fixed in nature (e.g., rent, compliance, legal and professional services, etc.); as such, our general and administrative expenses are not expected to scale up significantly as our revenue increases over time. 

Sales and marketing expenses 

Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 83 to 1,636,794 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 896,842 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to the combination of the following main drivers: 

the restructuring of our e-commerce business during the first half of 2023, during which we temporarily paused and postponed our marketing spending, and management made a tactical decision to preserve a significant portion of our marketing budget for later in the year, in order to better align the timing of marketing spending with major new product launches and thus maximize impact. In the latter portion of 2023 and continuing through the current nine months, we have significantly increased our advertising and marketing efforts, particularly in the areas of spending on paid ads on websites and social media platforms, in order to drive growth in our revenues and market share. 

the fact that the prior year nine months included a reversal of approximately 309,000 of previously-recognized stock-based compensation for certain individuals within the Company s sales and marketing function whose awards expired without ever having vested, as the related performance conditions (sales quotas) for those awards were not met. 

From a long-term perspective, while we expect that our total sales and marketing expenses will scale up to some degree as our revenue increases, we anticipate that such increases in sales and marketing expenses will be mitigated somewhat by our planned focus on growing the wholesale optical channel, which, due to the nature of that channel, inherently does not require costly marketing campaigns to acquire each customer and as a result typically carries a lower marketing cost per unit sold. Additionally, we generally expect that a retailer who is successful with our products will reorder in large quantities, also without significant marketing expenditure. 

Research and development costs 

Our research and development costs increased by 12 to 604,472 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 541,348 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

This increase was primarily attributable to the write-off of approximately 88,000 of previously-capitalized software costs related to the development of the Vyrb app (which was launched as an open beta version in 2021, and has had new features added over time, but had never been officially launched) as a result of management s decision in 2024 to de-emphasize the Vyrb app in favor of shifting our primary software development focus to the Lucyd app. Certain elements and features developed for the Vyrb app may potentially be incorporated into future releases of the Lucyd app. 

The impact of the aforementioned write-off was partially offset by the impacts of product development cycles and timing of associated research and development spending. 

Related party management fee 

Our related party management fee was 105,000 for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, based on the terms of the management services agreement between us and Tekcapital. 

29 

Other Income (Expense), net 

Total other income (expense), net in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 110,625. This amount was primarily comprised of dividends from our investments in money market funds, and, to a lesser extent, interest income earned on a short-term loan to a related party. 

Total other income (expense), net in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 90,317, and was primarily comprised of the combination of (i) approximately 52,000 of interest, dividends, and investment returns from our investments in money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills; and (ii) approximately 35,000 of refunds of certain amounts that had been previously charged to the Company from the Parent and Affiliates in prior periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately 4.5 million and 4.3 million, respectively. Our working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately 10.3 million and 5.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Net cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are mainly related to the investment of a portion of the proceeds from our recent equity offerings (as described below) in 6-month U.S. Treasury bills. 

Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are mainly driven by proceeds from multiple equity offering transactions as described below. 

Equity Offerings 

At-the-Market Offerings 

On April 15, 2024, we entered into an at-the-market offering agreement (the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC, as sales agent HCW ), relating to the sale of common stock. Under this agreement, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold a total of 557,988 shares and received approximately 3.9 million of gross proceeds, before deducting sales agent commissions and offering expenses. The net proceeds received by the Company from sales under the ATM Agreement amounted to approximately 3.7 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from sales under the ATM Agreement primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

30 

First Registered Direct Offering 

On May 1, 2024, the Company closed on a registered direct offering of 210,043 shares of its common stock and, in a concurrent private placement, warrants to purchase up to 210,043 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 4.88 per share, for a combined purchase price per share and warrant of 4.88. In exchange, the Company received approximately 1.0 million of gross proceeds, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In addition, the Company issued to the placement agent warrants to purchase up to 15,754 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 6.10 per share. The net proceeds received by the Company from this transaction amounted to approximately 0.8 million. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Approximately 0.1 million of the net proceeds received from this registered direct offering were used to pay a former agent for their waiver of a contractual right of first refusal; such payment has been reflected in the unaudited condensed financial statements as a reduction to additional paid in capital, as it represents a related cost of this equity transaction. 

Second Registered Direct Offering 

On May 29, 2024, the Company closed on a registered direct offering of 263,159 shares of its common stock and, in a concurrent private placement, warrants to purchase up to 263,159 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 9.50 per share, for a combined purchase price per share and warrant of 9.50. In exchange, the Company received approximately 2.5 million of gross proceeds, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In addition, the Company issued to the placement agent warrants to purchase up to 19,737 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 11.876 per share. The net proceeds received by the Company from this transaction amounted to approximately 2.1 million. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Warrant Exercises 

During September 2024, the Company entered into multiple warrant inducement transactions with certain holders of its existing warrants. Through these transactions, certain holders of various existing warrants to purchase an aggregate of 538,426 shares of common stock agreed to exercise such warrants (at adjusted or reduced exercise prices) in exchange for an aggregate of 538,426 shares of common stock plus new warrants (Series A through Series F warrants, with varying terms and exercise prices) to purchase an aggregate of 1,340,012 shares of common stock. In exchange, the Company received approximately 4.0 million of gross proceeds, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The total net proceeds received by the Company from these transactions amounted to approximately 3.5 million. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

On September 23, 2024, one of the holders of the Series A and Series B warrants exercised an aggregate of 40,000 warrants on a cashless basis and received 20,482 shares of common stock. 

In addition, on September 24, 2024, one of the holders of the warrants issued in connection with the First Registered Direct Offering elected to exercise their warrants to purchase an aggregate of 61,475 shares of common stock. The Company received approximately 300,000 of gross proceeds from this exercise. 

Other Factors 

We expect that operating losses could continue in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the expansion and development of our business. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents (including the proceeds from the equity offerings described above), plus the availability to borrow funds via the March 2024 related party agreement with Lucyd Ltd., will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. 

31 

However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, growth in the number of retail store customers, licenses, the needs of our e-commerce business and retail distribution network, expansion of our product and software offerings, and the timing of investments in technology and personnel to support the overall growth of our business. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to negotiate terms acceptable to us or at all. Geopolitical and macroeconomic factors could cause disruption in the global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital and negatively affect our liquidity in the future. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would be adversely affected. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 

There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and significant estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13(a)-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II - Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently the subject of any material pending legal proceedings; however, we may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 25, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

During September 2024, the Company
entered into multiple warrant inducement transactions with certain holders of its existing warrants. 

On
 September 3, 2024, the Company entered into inducement letter agreements with certain holders
 of existing warrants (originally issued on June 26, 2023) to purchase an aggregate of 126,699
 shares of common stock. The warrant holders exercised for cash the existing warrants at a
 reduced exercise price of 5.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of
 approximately 633,000; in addition to the shares of common stock issued as a result of the
 warrant exercise, the warrant holders also received new unregistered Series A and Series
 B warrants. This transaction closed on September 4, 2024, and the net proceeds received by
 the Company amounted to approximately 489,000. 

On
 September 18, 2024, the Company entered into inducement letter agreements with certain holders
 of existing warrants (originally issued on May 1, 2024) to purchase an aggregate of 148,567
 shares of common stock. The warrant holders exercised for cash the existing warrants at an
 adjusted exercise price of 5.13 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of
 approximately 762,000; in addition to the shares of common stock issued as a result of the
 warrant exercise, the warrant holders also received new unregistered Series C and Series
 D warrants. This transaction closed on September 19, 2024, and the net proceeds received
 by the Company amounted to approximately 672,000. 

On
 September 22, 2024, the Company entered into inducement letter agreements with certain holders
 of existing warrants (originally issued on May 29, 2024) to purchase an aggregate of 263,160
 shares of common stock. The warrant holders exercised for cash the existing warrants at an
 adjusted exercise price of 9.875 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of
 approximately 2.6 million; in addition to the shares of common stock issued as a result
 of the warrant exercise, the warrant holders also received new unregistered Series E and
 Series F warrants. This transaction closed on September 24, 2024, and the net proceeds received
 by the Company amounted to approximately 2.3 million. 

In connection with each of the aforementioned
warrant inducement transactions, the Company issued placement agent warrants to H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC. 

The aforementioned securities issued
under these transactions were sold and issued without registration under the Securities Act, in reliance on the exemptions provided by
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction not involving a public offering and Rule 506 promulgated under the Securities Act
as sales to accredited investors, and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws. 

Subsequently, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1
in order to register the aforementioned securities issued under these transactions, and such registration was declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission on October 17, 2024.
