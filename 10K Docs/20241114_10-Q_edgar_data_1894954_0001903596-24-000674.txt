CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INDUSTRY DATA 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements in this Quarterly Report, other than statements of historical
fact, are forward-looking statements for purposes of these provisions, including, without limitation, any projections regarding
the markets where we operate, any statements of the plans and objectives of our management for future operations, any statements concerning
proposed new products or services, any statements regarding expected capital expenditures, any statements regarding future economic conditions
or performance, and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. All forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly
Report are made as of the date hereof and are based on information available to us as of such date. We assume no obligation to update
any forward-looking statement. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may, 
 will, expects, plans, should, anticipates, intends, 
 seeks, believes, estimates, potential, forecasts, continue, 
or other forms of these words or similar words or expressions, or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Although we believe
that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such
expectations or any of the forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Actual results will likely differ, and could differ materially,
from those projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Prospective investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on any such
forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking
statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations,
and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy,
and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks,
and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial
condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 

We
 operate in an extremely competitive industry and are subject to pricing pressures. 

We
 have a history of losses and our audited financial statements include a statement that there
 is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As our costs increase,
 we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability. 

Our
 business and future growth depends on the needs and success of our customers, and we have
 substantial customer concentration. 

We
 may not be able to successfully execute on our anticipated growth strategies and manage the
 expansion of our business operations effectively. 

We
 may fail to expand our sales and distribution channels and increase market penetration into
 target markets. 

We
 are dependent on third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including suppliers located outside
 of the United States, and our operating results could be adversely affected by changes in
 the cost and availability of raw materials, as well as increases in costs, disruption of
 supply, or shortage of any of our battery components, such as electronic and mechanical parts,
 or raw materials used in the production of such parts. 

Changes
 in the economic conditions or political climate abroad could negatively impact our supply
 chain or result in tariffs that would apply to our imported goods, which would impact our
 operating margins. 

We
 may not be able to successfully onshore our semi-automated pack assembly in a timely manner
 or at all, or scale to mass production. 

We
 could face potential product liability claims relating to our products, which could result
 in significant costs and liabilities, which would reduce our profitability. 

Our
 operations expose us to litigation, tax, environmental, and other legal compliance risks. 

Our
 failure to introduce new products and product enhancements and broad market acceptance of
 new technologies introduced by our competitors could adversely affect our business. 

We
 may not be able to successfully enter into new partnerships which may negatively impact the
 development of our home energy storage products and subsequent sales growth. There are significantly
 larger companies within the home energy storage market and we may also lack sufficient resources
 to bring a commercially viable home energy product to market and successfully market and
 sale to consumers. 

i 

Quality
 problems with our products could harm our reputation and erode our competitive position. 

We
 may need to raise additional capital to support our business, and our ability to raise necessary
 capital in the future may be limited and our stockholders may be diluted by future securities
 offerings. 

We
 are an emerging growth company and elect to comply with certain reduced reporting
 requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our securities less
 attractive to investors. 

All
forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary
statements. Our actual results will likely differ, and may differ materially, from anticipated results. Financial estimates are subject
to change and are not intended to be relied upon as predictions of future operating results, and we assume no obligation to update or
disclose revisions to those estimates. If we do update or correct one or more forward-looking statements, investors and others should
not conclude that we will make additional updates or corrections. 

This
report includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys, and
studies conducted by third parties as well as our own estimates. All of the market data used in this report involve a number of assumptions
and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such data. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys,
and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee
the accuracy or completeness of such information. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities for our products include several
key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research, and other surveys, which may be based on
a small sample size and may fail to accurately reflect market opportunities. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable,
no independent source has verified such assumptions. 

Notice
Regarding Trademarks 

This
Quarterly Report includes trademarks, tradenames, and service marks that are our property or the property of others. Solely for convenience,
such trademarks and tradenames sometimes appear without any or symbol. However, failure to
include such symbols is not intended to suggest, in any way, that we will not assert our rights or the rights of any applicable licensor,
to these trademarks and tradenames.

, which was effective at 5:00 p.m. Pacific
Time on October 8, 2024. See Note 13 Subsequent Events in this Quarterly Report for additional information about
the Reverse Stock Split (as defined in Note 13 below). 

Historically, the Company s growth has been
funded through a combination of sales of equity interests, third-party debt, and working capital loans. The Company s sales for
the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 26.5 and sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 29.0 compared
to the same period in 2023, as the overall RV market experienced a severe slowdown. Through September 30, 2024, the Company distributed
 4 for the settlement of fractional shares related to warrant exercises compared to receiving net proceeds of 49,777 from warrant exercises
during the same period in 2023. 

On
August 8, 2024, the Company sold in a public offering (the August 2024 Public Offering ), (i) common units (the
 Common Units ), each consisting of one share of common stock, two Series A warrants each to purchase one share of common
stock (pre-Reverse Stock Split and pre-Adjustment, and each, a Series A Warrant and one Series B warrant to purchase
such number of shares of common stock as determined in the Series B warrant (each, a Series B Warrant ), and (ii) 
pre-funded units (the Pre-Funded Units, and together with the Common Units, the Units ), each consisting of
one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock (each, a Pre-Funded Warrant ), two Series A Warrants, and one
Series B Warrant, through Aegis Capital Corp. (the Underwriter ). In addition, the Company granted the Underwriter a 45-day
option to purchase additional shares of common stock and/or Pre-Funded Warrants and/or Series A Warrants and/or Series B Warrants, representing
up to 15 of the number of the respective securities sold in the August 2024 Public Offering, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
The Underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option with respect to Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants
(pre-Reverse Stock Split). The Common Units were sold at a price of per unit and the Pre-Funded Warrants were sold at a price of
 per unit (pre-Reverse Stock Split). The Pre-Funded Warrants were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of per share
(pre-Reverse Stock Split and could be exercised at any time until all Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. As of September
30, 2024, all Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised. 

On February 9, 2024, a registration statement on Form
S-1 (File No. 333-276663) was declared effective for the resale, from time to time, of up to 17,820 shares of the Company s common
stock by a selling stockholder in connection with an equity line of credit financing. During the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, the Company sold 0 shares of common stock to the stockholder under the equity line of credit and received proceeds of 0. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 4,336 shares of common stock to the stockholder under the equity line of credit
and received proceeds of 828,491 compared to 0 in the same prior year period. In addition, during the three months ended September 30,
2024, the Company issued 154 shares of common stock to satisfy interest payments to a note holder in connection with a short-term convertible
note, totaling 15,028, and also made cash payments totaling 19,331 for monthly interest as well as 100,375 interest due at loan payoff.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 415 shares of common stock to satisfy interest payments to a note
holder in connection with a short-term convertible note, totaling 90,839 and issued 79 shares of common stock for payment on accrued
compensation totaling 36,029, compared to zero shares issued during the same prior year period. 

Management
believes that these factors will contribute to achieving operating efficiency and profitability. However, there can be no assurance that
the Company will be successful in achieving its objectives, including achieving operating efficiency and profitability. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business; however, the above conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The
Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term
revolving loans, stockholder promissory notes, and long-term debt. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and short-term revolving loans approximates their respective carrying values because of the short-term nature of those
instruments. The fair value of the stockholder promissory notes, convertible notes, and long-term debt approximates their respective
carrying values because the interest rate approximates market rates available to the Company for similar obligations with the same maturities.

and/or Series A Warrants and/or Series B Warrants, representing up to 15 of the number of the respective securities sold in the August
2024 Public Offering, solely to cover over-allotments, if any. The Underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option with respect
to Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants (pre-Reverse Stock Split). 

The
Common Units were sold at a price of per unit and the Pre-Funded Warrants were sold at a price of per unit (pre-Reverse
Stock Split). 

The
Pre-Funded Warrants were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of per share (Pre-Reverse Stock Split) and could be exercised at any
time until all Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. As of September 30, 2024, all Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised. 

Each
Series A Warrant is exercisable at any time or times beginning on September 30, 2024, which was the first trading day following the
Company s notice to the Series A Warrant holders of stockholder approval received at the Company s annual meeting of
stockholders held on September 27, 2024 (the 2024 Annual Meeting ), and will expire five years from such date. Each

share of common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split). The exercise price of the Series A Warrants was subject to reduction on the
11 th trading day after the stockholder approval to the greater of the lowest daily volume weighted average price VWAP during the ten trading day period following the stockholder approval and the floor price of (representing
20 of the lower of our common stock s closing price on The Nasdaq Capital Market on the date that we priced the August 2024
Public Offering (post-Reverse Stock Split) or our common stock s average closing price on The Nasdaq Capital Market for the
five trading days ending on such date (such lower price, without giving effect to such 20 reduction, the Nasdaq Minimum
Price ), and the number of shares issuable upon exercise would be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate exercise
price would remain unchanged. As of September 30, 2024, there would have been shares
of common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split and assuming the Adjustment had occurred on September 30, 2024) issuable upon exercise of the
Series A Warrants as of that date. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the exercise price under the Series A Warrants was reduced to
the floor price of (representing
20 of the Nasdaq Minimum Price, post-Reverse Stock Split), beginning on October 14, 2024, the 11 th trading day

of common stock have been issued upon exercise of Series A Warrants and shares
of Common stock remain
issuable upon exercise of Series A Warrants. 

Each
Series B Warrant was exercisable immediately upon issuance at an exercise price of 0.10 per share (post-Reverse Stock Split). The number
of shares of common stock issuable under the Series B Warrants were subject to adjustment using a reset price based on the weighted average
price of common stock over a rolling five-trading-day period between the issuance date of the Class B Warrants and the close of trading
on the tenth trading day following stockholder approval, subject to certain floor prices. As of September 30, 2024, 
 shares of Common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split)
had been issued upon exercise of Series B Warrants and there were 
 shares of Common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split)
issuable upon exercise of Series B Warrants based on the reset price of 
 (representing the lowest arithmetic average of
the daily VWAP during the 5 trading day period from September 12, 2024 through September 18, 2024. Effective October 8, 2024, after market
close, a reverse stock split occurred and as of November 12, 2024, 87,384 shares of common stock remain issuable upon exercise of Series
B Warrants using the reset price, which was reduced to the floor price of 5.206 (representing 20 of the Nasdaq Minimum Price (post-Reverse
Stock Split and post-Adjustment).

In
the first quarter of 2022, the Company entered into two new long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreements for office and
warehouse space resulting in the Company recognizing an additional lease liability of 2,348,509, representing the present value of the
lease payments discounted using an effective interest rate of 8.07 and 8.86 , and corresponding ROU assets of 2,348,509. The leases
expire in December 2026 and December 2028, the latter of which contains one three-year option to renew. 

In
the first quarter of 2021, the Company entered into a long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreement for office and warehouse space
resulting in the Company recognizing an additional lease liability totaling of 1,268,089, representing the present value of the lease
payments discounted using an effective interest rate of 7.47 and a corresponding ROU asset of 1,268,089. The lease expires in January
2028 and contains one three-year option to renew. 

The
Company had another lease that expired in January 2023 and was terminated at that time. The relating right of use asset and lease liability
were written off at that time. The company has one further lease that expires in February 2025. The leases generally provide
for annual increases based on a fixed amount and generally require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, and repairs. 

On
September 19, 2024, the Company signed a Termination of Commercial Lease Agreement regarding the lease previously contracted to end in
December 2028. The cancelation was effective September 30, 2024. The corresponding ROU asset and lease liability were therefore removed
from the Company s balance sheet effective September 30, 2024.

Subleases 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company subleases office and warehouse space under one of its existing operating leases with similar terms
as the Company s lease agreements. Two additional leases terminated in February 2023. Because the Company is not relieved of its
primary obligations under the original lease, the Company accounts for the subleases as a lessor. Sublease rental income is recorded
based on the contractual rental payments which are not substantially different from recognition on a straight-line basis over the lease
term and totaled 10,753 and 10,440 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 32,051 and 39,476
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deferred income
totaled 4,549 and 4,445, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the accompanying Balance
Sheets. 

The
total future minimum sublease payments are 17,922, all due in the 12 months ending September 30, 2025. 

Litigation 

The
Company may be involved from time to time in litigation or claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. While the ultimate
liability, if any, arising from these claims cannot be determined with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of any such
matters will not likely have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial statements.

See
Note 11 Stockholders Equity in the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part IV of the Annual
Report for further information regarding the 2021 Incentive Award Plan and 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

2021
Incentive Award Plan 

The
purpose of the Company s 2021 Incentive Award Plan is to enhance the Company s ability to attract, retain and motivate persons
who make (or are expected to make) important contributions to the Company by providing these individuals with equity ownership opportunities.
Various stock-based awards may be granted under the 2021 Incentive Award
Plan to eligible employees, consultants, and non-employee directors. The number of shares issued under the 2021 Incentive Award Plan
is subject to limits and is adjusted annually. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate number of shares that can be issued under the
2021 Incentive Award Plan is , of which options and RSUs (post-Reverse Stock Split) have been granted. 

2021
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

The
purpose of the Company s 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is to assist eligible employees of the Company in acquiring a stock
ownership in the Company and to help such employees provide for their future security and to encourage them to remain in the employment
of the Company. The 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan consists of a Section 423 Component and Non-Section 423 Component. The Section
423 Component is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan and authorizes the grant of options. Options granted under the
Non-Section 423 Component are granted pursuant to separate offerings containing sub-plans. Option awards are generally granted with an
exercise price equal to 85 of the lesser of the fair market value of a share on (a) the applicable grant date and (b) the applicable
exercise date, or such other price as designated by the administrator, provided that in no event shall the option price be less that
the per share par value price. The maximum number of shares granted under the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan may not exceed 
shares (post-Reverse Stock Split). 

The
fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The option-pricing model requires
a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the expected stock price volatility and the expected option term. Expected
volatility was calculated based upon similar traded companies historical share price movements as adequate historical experience
is not available to provide a reasonable estimate. Expected term is calculated based on the simplified method as adequate historical
experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate. The simplified method will continue to apply until enough historical experience
is available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is calculated based on the yield from
U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with an equivalent term. The Company has historically not paid dividends and have no foreseeable plans
to pay dividends. 

The
Company has computed the fair value of all options granted through September 30, 2024 using the following assumptions:

began to vest in equal quarterly installments beginning September 30, 2023 and ending June 30, 2026. The options granted in March 2024 vested 50 at time of grant with
the remaining shares vesting in 12 equal consecutive quarterly installments commencing June 30, 2024 and becoming fully vested on March

OVERVIEW 

Expion360
focuses on the design, assembly, manufacturing, and sale of lithium iron phosphate LiFePO4 batteries and supporting accessories
for recreational vehicles RVs ), marine applications and home energy storage products with plans to expand into industrial
applications. We design, assemble, and distribute high-powered, lithium battery solutions using ground-breaking concepts with a creative
sales and marketing approach. We believe that our product offerings include some of the most dense and minimal-footprint batteries in
the RV and marine industries. We are developing our e360 Home Energy Storage System, which we expect to change the industry in barrier
price, flexibility, and integration. We are deploying multiple intellectual property strategies with research and products to sustain
and scale the business. We currently have customers consisting of dealers, wholesalers, private label customers, and original equipment
manufacturers OEMs who are driving revenue and brand awareness nationally. 

Our
primary target markets are currently the RV and marine industries. We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid
market conversion from lead-acid to lithium batteries as the primary method of power sourcing in these industries. We are also focused
on expanding into the home energy storage market with the introduction of our two LiFePO4 battery storage solutions, where we aim to
provide a cost-effective, low barrier of entry, flexible system for those looking to power their homes via solar energy, wind, or grid
back-up. Along with RV, marine and home energy storage markets, we aim to provide additional capacities to the ever-expanding electric
forklift and industrial material handling markets. 

Our
e360 product line, which is manufactured for the RV and marine industries, was launched in December 2020. The e360 product line, through
its sales growth, has shown to be a preferred conversion solution for lead-acid batteries. In December 2023, we announced our entrance
into the home energy storge market with our introduction of two LiFePO4 battery storage solutions that enable residential and small business
customers to create their own stable micro-energy grid and lessen the impact of increasing power fluctuations and outages. We believe
that our e360 Home Energy Storage System has strong revenue potential with recurring income opportunities for us and our associated sales
partners.

Our
products provide numerous advantages for various industries that are looking to migrate to lithium-based energy storage. They incorporate
detailed-oriented design and engineering and strong case materials and internal and structural layouts and are backed by responsive customer
service. 

COMPETITIVE
STRENGTHS 

We
believe the following strengths differentiate Expion360 and create long-term, sustainable competitive advantages: 

Superior
Capacity to Lead-Acid Competitors 

Lead-acid batteries have historically been the standard
in RV and marine transportation vehicles. Our lithium-ion batteries offer superior capacity to our lead-acid competitors with an expected
lifespan of approximately 12 years three to four times the lifespan of certain lead-acid batteries and with ten times the number
of charging cycles. Furthermore, we believe that our typical battery provides three times the power of the typical, lead-acid battery
despite being half the weight (comparing, for example, a typical lead-acid battery like the Renogy Deep Cycle AGM, which is rated at 100Ah,
to our own LFP 100Ah battery and assuming slow discharge at a 1C rate). 

In addition, we offer a 4.5 Ah 26650 lithium-ion phosphate
battery cell, which allows us to increase energy density by over 32 compared to traditional 3.4 Ah 26650 cells. 

Expansion into New Markets 

We include our e360 SmartTalk, an innovative mobile
app, in many of our battery models that allows the seamless integration and management of e360 Bluetooth-enabled LiFePO4 batteries. The
technology enables users to wirelessly monitor and manage e360 batteries, providing a view of individual battery conditions and performance
as well as a comprehensive view of an entire power bank consisting of multiple e360 batteries. The 48 Volt GC2 LiFePO4 battery was our
first e360 SmartTalk Battery for powering electric golf carts and other light electric vehicles LEVs ). 

In December 2023, we entered the home energy storage
market with our introduction of two LiFePO4 battery storage solutions: a wall mounted all-in-one inverter and 10kW battery and an expandable
server rack style battery cabinet system. We believe our new home energy storage product line will benefit from a fast-growing battery
energy storage market, which is forecasted by Markets and Markets to grow at a 26.4 CAGR to reach 17.5 billion by 2028. Further, according
to Clean Energy Group, approximately 3.2 million homes in the United States have solar panels installed, but only about 6 of residential
solar systems have battery storage. Our home energy storage products are currently under development including UL testing and certification,
in addition to other requirements for various Authorities Having Jurisdiction AHJ ). 

In January 2024, we introduced our next generation
12V GC2 and Group 27 series LiFePO4 batteries. The new versions now include higher amp-hour options (4.0Ah and 4.5Ah cell technology)
and the latest advancements in power technology features, including Expion360 s proprietary Vertical Heat Conduction internal
heating, Bluetooth and controller area network CAN Bus communication. We began taking pre-orders of the new 12V GC2
and Group 27 batteries in the first quarter of 2024.We began delivering to customers in the second quarter of 2024. 

In July 2024, we launched our new Edge battery. The
slim design adds greater flexibility during installation and comes in either 12V or 48V versions. We are seeing high customer interest
and started shipping the new Edge in July 2024. 

Strong National Retail Customers and Distribution
Channels 

We have sales relationships with many major RV and
marine retailers and plans to use what we believe is a strong reputation in the lithium battery space to create an even stronger distribution
channel. Current and former members of management have used their decades of experience in the energy and RV industries to cultivate relationships
with numerous retailers in the space, including Camping World, a leading national RV retailer; and Meyer Distributing, Inc., a leading
national marketer and distributor of automotive and RV specialty products. 

27 

Home Energy Integration 

We are currently having discussions with integration
partners. This is key for the development of our home energy storage products and subsequent sales growth.

Reverse Stock Split and Reverse Stock Split True-Up
Payment 

Effective as of 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on October
8, 2024 (the Effective Date ), the Company effected a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split ),
which was approved by the Board of Directors on September 27, 2024, following stockholder approval at the 2024 Annual Meeting. No fractional
shares of common stock were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split and instead each holder of common stock who was otherwise entitled
to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split received one whole share of common stock in lieu of such fractional
share. As a result of this, 210,668 shares were issued on or before October 17, 2024. In addition, the Reverse Stock Split effected a
reduction in the number of shares issuable pursuant to the Company s equity awards, warrants and non-plan options outstanding as
of the Effective Date of the Reverse Stock Split, and a corresponding increase in the respective exercise prices, conversion prices, reset
prices and the like thereunder. In conjunction with the Reverse Stock Split, the derivative liability has been relieved, and the expense
of 5.9 million in Other Expense was reversed to result in no annual expense. 

As a result of the VWAP of the common stock during
the five trading days before and after the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse Stock Split cash true-up payment provision in the Series A
Warrants, which is capped at 5 million in the aggregate under all Series A Warrants, was triggered, but the payment of the Reverse Stock
Split cash true-up payment is currently suspended in accordance with the terms of the Series A Warrants. 

All of the Company s historical share and per
share information related to issued and outstanding common stock and outstanding options and warrants exercisable for common stock in
these financial statements have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

28 

August
2024 Public Offering 

On August 8, 2024, the Company sold in a public offering
(the August 2024 Public Offering ), (i) 33,402,000 common units (the Common Units, Pre-Reverse Stock Split),
each consisting of one share of common stock, two Series A warrants each to purchase one share of common stock (pre-Reverse Stock Split
and pre-Adjustment, and each, a Series A Warrant and one Series B warrant to purchase such number of shares of common stock
as determined in the Series B warrant (each, a Series B Warrant ), and (ii) 16,598,000 pre-funded units (the Pre-Funded
Units, and together with the Common Units, the Units, Pre-Reverse Stock Split), each consisting of one pre-funded
warrant to purchase one share of common stock (each, a Pre-Funded Warrant ), two Series A Warrants, and one Series B Warrant,
through the Underwriter. 

In addition, the Company granted the Underwriter a
45-day option to purchase additional shares of common stock and/or Pre-Funded Warrants and/or Series A Warrants and/or Series B Warrants,
representing up to 15 of the number of the respective securities sold in the August 2024 Public Offering, solely to cover over-allotments,
if any. The Underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option with respect to 15,000,000 Series A Warrants and 7,500,000 Series
B Warrants (Pre-Reverse Stock Split). 

The Common Units were sold at a price of 0.20 per
unit and the Pre-Funded Warrants were sold at a price of 0.199 per unit (Pre-Reverse Stock Split). 

The Pre-Funded Warrants were immediately exercisable
at an exercise price of 0.001 per share (pre-Reverse Stock Split) and could be exercised at any time until all Pre-Funded Warrants are
exercised in full. As of September 30, 2024, all Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised. 

Each Series A Warrant is exercisable at any time or
times beginning on September 30, 2024, which was the first trading day following the Company s notice to the Series A Warrant holders
of stockholder approval received at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders held on September 27, 2024 (the 2024 Annual
Meeting ), and will expire five years from such date. Each Series A Warrant was initially exercisable at an exercise price of 24.00
per share of common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split). The exercise price of the Series A Warrants was subject to reduction on the 11 th 
trading day after the stockholder approval to the greater of the lowest daily volume weighted average price VWAP during
the ten trading day period following the stockholder approval and the floor price of 5.206 (representing 20 of the lower of our common
stock s closing price on The Nasdaq Capital Market on the date that we priced the August 2024 Public Offering,, post-Reverse Stock
Split) or our common stock s average closing price on The Nasdaq Capital Market for the five trading days ending on such date (such
lower price, without giving effect to such 20 reduction, the Nasdaq Minimum Price ), and the number of shares issuable upon
exercise would be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate exercise price would remain unchanged. As of September 30, 2024, there
would have been 5,301,592 shares of common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split and assuming the Adjustment had occurred on September 30, 2024)
issuable upon exercise of the Series A Warrants as of that date. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the exercise price under the Series
A Warrants was reduced to the floor price of 5.206 (representing 20 of the Nasdaq Minimum Price, post-Reverse Stock Split), beginning
on October 14, 2024, the 11 th trading day following stockholder approval. As of November 12, 2024, 14,900 shares of Common
stock have been issued upon exercise of Series A Warrants and 5,286,692 shares of Common stock remain issuable upon exercise of Series
A Warrants. 

Each Series B Warrant was exercisable immediately
upon issuance at an exercise price of 0.10 per share (post-Reverse Stock Split). The number of shares of common stock issuable under
the Series B Warrants were subject to adjustment using a reset price based on the weighted average price of common stock over a rolling
five-trading-day period between the issuance date of the Class B Warrants and the close of trading on the tenth trading day following
stockholder approval, subject to certain floor prices. As of September 30, 2024, 342,588 shares of Common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split)
had been issued upon exercise of Series B Warrants and there were 1,032,198 shares of Common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split) issuable
upon exercise of Series B Warrants based on the reset price of 5.45 (representing the lowest arithmetic average of the daily VWAP during
the 5 trading day period from September 12, 2024 through September 18, 2024. Effective October 8, 2024, after market close, a reverse
stock split occurred and as of November 12, 2024, 87,384 shares of common stock remain issuable upon exercise of Series B Warrants using
the reset price, which was reduced to the floor price of 5.206 (representing 20 of the Nasdaq Minimum Price (post-Reverse Stock Split
and post-Adjustment). 

29 

Pursuant to an underwriting agreement by and between
the Company and the Underwriter, the Company paid the Underwriter a total cash underwriting discount of 700,000, equal to 7 of gross
proceeds received in the August 2024 Public Offering, reimbursement for Underwriter expenses of 100,000, equal to 1 of gross proceeds
received, and reimbursement for road show, diligence, legal fees and disbursements of 100,000, equal to 1 of gross proceeds received,
as well as 5,000 for investor counsel fee, totaling 905,000 in cash fees deducted from cash proceeds. 

Payoff of 3i Note 

On August 8, 2024, in connection with the closing
of the August 2024 Public Offering, the Company repaid that certain senior unsecured convertible note (the 3i Note issued
to 3i, LP, and the Company s obligations under the 3i Note were fully satisfied and discharged. 

Termination of Equity Line of Credit 

In connection with the August 2024 Public Offering,
the Company and Tumim Stone Capital, LLC Tumim mutually agreed to terminate that certain Common Stock Purchase Agreement,
dated December 27, 2023 (the Common Stock Purchase Agreement ), effective immediately upon the closing of the August 2024
Public Offering. 

Termination of Right of First Refusal 

On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Mutual
Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement with Alexander Capital L.P. Alexander ), pursuant to which
the parties agreed to terminate a certain provision in that certain underwriting agreement, dated March 31, 2022, between the Company
and Alexander, as representative of the underwriters, which granted Alexander a right of first refusal to act as the Company s financial
advisor, book-runner, book-running manager, manager, placement agent, or underwriter in connection with any transaction contemplated or
consummated by us (the ROFR Provision ). In exchange for the termination of the ROFR Provision, and in connection with the
closing of the August 2024 Public Offering, the Company made a cash payment to Alexander in the amount of 400,900. 

New Products 

In May 2024, we announced the launch of our Edge 
battery, which is designed for off-grid enthusiasts, bringing a new Expion360 option designed with performance, reliability, and versatility
in mind. The slim design adds greater flexibility during installation and comes in either 12V or 48V versions. We began taking pre-orders
of our Edge battery in the second quarter of 2024. We began shipping the Edge in July 2024. 

Key Factors
AND TRENDS Affecting Our BUSINESS AND Results OF OPERATIONS 

We believe there are several important factors that have impacted
and will continue to impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

 Consumer Demand 

Although our sales are primarily generated from dealers,
wholesalers, and OEMs focused on the RV and marine markets, the demand for our products from these customers depends on consumer demand.
Our sales are completed on a purchase order basis, and most are without firm, long-term revenue commitments or sales arrangements, which
we expect to continue going forward. Accordingly, our growth prospects and future sales are subject to risks and uncertainties related
in part to consumer demand for our products, which is affected by a number of factors, including fuel costs, discretionary spending, macroeconomic
conditions, including inflation, changes in tariffs and interest rates, geopolitical pressures, and volatility in the RV [and marine]
markets. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased adoption of the RV lifestyle benefited battery suppliers. However,
in recent years we have seen a rise in fuel costs, higher interest rates, and other changes in macroeconomic conditions, which have resulted
in decreased consumer spending decisions which is affecting our industry. These conditions may continue to have a negative effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

30 

While RV and marine applications drive current revenues,
in December 2023, we announced our plans to enter the home energy storage market with our introduction of two LiFePO4 battery storage
solutions. Our e360 Home Energy Storage System aims to provide a cost-effective, low barrier of entry, flexible system for those looking
to power their homes via solar energy, wind, or grid back-up. The success of our strategy depends on (i) continued growth of these addressable
markets in line with our expectations, and (ii) our ability to successfully enter these markets with commercially viable products. We
expect to incur significant marketing costs understanding these new markets, and researching and targeting customers in these end markets,
which may not result in sales. We may lack the resources to execute our plans in home energy storage. If we fail to execute on this growth
strategy in accordance with our expectations, our sales growth would be limited to the growth of existing products and existing end markets. 

Expion360 has recently added several new distributors
and OEM customers in RV and marine markets. Management believes that orders resulting from these new relationships will result in significant
new revenue for 2025. 

Manufacturing and Supply Chain 

Our batteries are manufactured by multiple third-party
manufacturers located in Asia, who also produce our battery cells. We then assemble and package the batteries in the United States for
sale to our customers. While we do not have long-term purchase arrangements with our third-party manufacturers and our purchases are completed
on a purchase order basis, we have had strong relationships with our third-party manufacturers spanning many years. Our close working
relationships with our foreign suppliers, reflected in our ability to increase our purchase order volumes (qualifying us for related volume-based
discounts) and to order and receive delivery of components in anticipation of required demand, has helped us moderate increased supply-related
costs associated with inflation, currency fluctuations, and U.S. government tariffs imposed on our imports and to avoid potential shipment
delays. We aim to maintain an appropriate level of inventory to satisfy our expected supply requirements. We believe that we could locate
alternative third-party manufacturers to fulfill our needs. 

Our third-party manufacturers source the raw materials
and battery components required for the production of our batteries directly from third party suppliers that meet our approval and quality
standards, and as a result, we may have limited control over the agreed pricing for these raw materials and battery components. We estimate
that raw material costs account for over half of our cost of goods sold. The costs of these raw materials, particularly lithium-ion batteries,
are volatile and beyond our control. Additionally, availability of the raw materials used to manufacture our products may be limited at
times, resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Our battery cell manufacturers have joint venture factories
outside of Asia and have secured sourcing contracts from lithium suppliers in South America and Australia. In addition, we secured a secondary
source for lithium iron phosphate cells used in our batteries from a supplier in Europe, enabling us to source materials outside of Asia
in the event it becomes necessary or desirable to do so. 

Product and Customer Mix 

As of September 30, 2024, we sell 14 models of LiFEPO4
batteries, the Aura 600, and individual or bundled accessories for battery systems. Our products are sold to different customers (i.e.,
dealers, wholesalers, OEMs, etc.) at differing prices and have varying costs. The average selling price and costs of goods sold for a
particular product will vary with changes in the sales channel mix, volume of products sold, and the prices of such products sold relative
to other products. While we work with our suppliers to limit price and supply cost increases, our products may see price increases resulting
from a rise in supply costs due to currency fluctuations, inflation, and tariffs. Accessory and OEM sales typically have lower average
selling prices and resulting margins, which could decrease our margins and negatively affect our growth or require us to increase the
prices of our products. However, the benefits of increased sales volumes typically offset these reductions. The relative margins of products
sold also impact our results of operation. As we introduce new products, we may see a change in product and sales channel mix which could
result in period-to-period fluctuations in our overall gross margin. 

Competition 

We compete with both traditional lead-acid and lithium-ion
battery manufacturers that primarily either import their products and/or components or manufacture their products and/or components under
a private label. As we develop new products and expand into new markets, we may experience competition with a broader range of companies.
These companies may have more resources than us and be able to allocate more resources to their current and future products. Our competitors
may source products or components at lower costs than us, which may require us to evaluate our own costs, lower our product prices, or
increase our sales volume to maintain our expected profitability levels. 

31 

Research and Development 

We anticipate that additional investments in our infrastructure
and research and development spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, address the needs of our customers,
further develop and enhance our products and services, and expand into new geographic areas and market segments. 

New technologies are rapidly emerging in the markets
where we conduct business and many new energy storage technologies have been introduced over the past several years. Our ability to achieve
significant and sustained penetration of key developing markets, including the RV, marine, residential energy storage, and small commercial
energy storage markets, will depend upon our success in developing these and other technologies, either independently, through joint ventures,
or through acquisitions, which in each case may require significant capital and commitment of resources to research and development. Accordingly,
we may need to seek additional debt and equity financing to fund our research and development efforts and planned growth. 

Certifications 

We have completed the final requirements to obtain
UL Safety Certifications on our new 12V Group 27 100Ah and 132Ah batteries, and on our 12V GC2 battery. Now that these certifications
have been completed, all of the batteries produced by us will have a UL Safety Certification, emphasizing our commitment to quality, safety
and service for our customers. 

COMPONENTS
OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Revenue 

Our revenue is generated from the sale of products
consisting primarily of batteries and accessories. We recognize revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to our customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration it is expected to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. All of our sales
are primarily within the United States. 

Cost of Sales 

Our primary cost of sales as a percentage of sales
is related to our direct product and landing costs. Direct labor costs consist of payroll costs (including taxes and benefits) of employees
directly engaged in assembly activities. Per full absorption cost accounting, overhead related to our cost of sales is added, consisting
primarily of warehouse rent and utilities. The costs can increase or decrease based on costs of product and assembly parts (purchased
at market pricing), customer supply requirements, and the amount of labor required to assemble a product, along with the allocation of
fixed overhead. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and benefits, legal and professional fees, and sales and marketing costs. Other costs include facility and related
costs, research and development, software and information technology, and travel expenses. 

Interest Expense and Other Expense (Income) 

Interest expense consists of interest costs on loans
with interest rates ranging from 3.75 to 10.0 and amortization of convertible note costs. The amortized convertible note costs were
 334,000 and 667,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and include all associated expenses due to
the convertible note being paid off in August, 2024. The costs were 0 for each of the same periods in 2023. 

32 

Provision
for Income Taxes 

We
are subject to corporate federal and state income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax basis. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date.
Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

We
have adopted the provisions in ASC 740, Income Taxes, related to accounting for uncertain tax positions, which require recognition of
the impact of a tax position in the financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination and
on the technical merits of the position. We have concluded that there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30,
2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Our
practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense. We had no accrual for interest
or penalties on our balance sheet at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 and did not recognize any interest and/or penalties in our
statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, since there are no material unrecognized tax
benefits. We do not expect any material change to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to occur within the next twelve months. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Net sales for the three months ended September 30,
2024 decreased by 501,000, or 26.5 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net sales were 1.4 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net sales for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 decreased by 1.5 million, or 29.0 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net sales were 3.6 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable
to the lingering effects of the downturn in the RV market, combined with customers limiting orders in anticipation of the availability
of our new products with enhanced features. 

33 

Cost
of Sales 

Cost
of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 197,000, or 13.9 , compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. Cost of sales was 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased by 12.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior
year period. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we liquidated some non-core product, which was a factor in reducing leased warehouse space.
If we had not done the liquidation, cost of sales would have decreased by 303,000, or 21.3 , compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. Cost of sales would have been 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.4 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales would have increased by 7.9 in the three months ended September 30,
2024 compared to the prior year period. 

Total
cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 829,000, or 22.1 , compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Cost of sales were 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased by 7.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior
year period. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we liquidated some non-core product, which was a factor in reducing leased warehouse space.
If we had not done the liquidation, cost of sales would have decreased by 935,000, or 24.9 , compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Cost of sales would have been 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales would have increased by 5.1 in the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to the prior year period. 

The
percentage increase in cost of sales for both periods was primarily related to the decrease in net sales resulting in higher fixed overhead
costs per unit, as well as the liquidation of non-core product increasing our cost of sales above what they would have been without the
liquidation.

gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 304,000, or 64.3 , compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. Gross profit was 169,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 473,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 12.9 for that period, representing 12.1 for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 25.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we liquidated some non-core product, which was a factor in reducing leased warehouse space.
If we had not done the liquidation, gross profit would have decreased by 242,000, or 51.3 , compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. Gross profit would have been 230,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 473,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales would have decreased by 7.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the prior year period. 

Our
gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 654,000, or 47.7 , compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Gross profit was 717,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.4 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 7.1 for that period, representing 19.7 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 26.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we
liquidated some non-core product, which was a factor in reducing leased warehouse space. If we had not done the liquidation, gross profit
would have decreased by 592,000, or 43.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit would have been 778,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit as a percentage
of sales would have decreased by 5.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 

34 

The decrease in gross profit for both periods was
primarily attributable to decreases in sales which drove higher fixed overhead costs per unit, as well as the liquidation of non-core
product increasing our cost of sales above what they would have been without the liquidation. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 194,000, or 8.5 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, fees related to repayment of the 3i Note and termination of the
lease, categorized as other, made up the majority of the increase, while decreases in legal and professional fees accounted
for the largest reduction in expenses, along with a reduction in salaries and benefits. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 73,000, or 1.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general
and administrative expenses were 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 6.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, fees related to repayment of the convertible note and termination of
the lease, categorized as other, made up the majority of the increase, while decreases in legal and professional fees accounted
for the largest reduction in expenses.

Other
Expense / (Income 

Our
other expense / (income) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 6.9 million and (6,000), respectively. Other expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily made up of the change in fair value of the warrants issued as part of the
Aegis financing, along with interest expense and settlement expense. Other income in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was almost
entirely interest income, and other expense was entirely made up of interest expense. 

Our other expense for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.7 million and 276,000, respectively. Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily
made up of the change in fair value of the warrants issued as part of the Aegis financing, along with interest expense and settlement
expense. 

35 

Other
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily settlement expense, along with interest expense, partially offset
by interest income. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, change in fair value of warrants totaled 5.9 million and 0, respectively, settlement
expense totaled 401,000 and 0, respectively, while interest expense totaled 468,000 and 27,000, respectively. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, change in fair value of warrants totaled 5.9 million and 0, respectively, settlement expense totaled
 710,000 and 282,000, respectively, interest income totaled 60,000 and 101,000, respectively, and interest expense totaled 972,000
and 92,000, respectively. 

Net
Loss 

Our net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.8 million and 1.8 million, respectively. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
was 13.2 million and 5.3 million, respectively. The increase in net loss for both periods was primarily the result of lower net sales
and higher other expenses due to change in fair value of warrants and settlement expense for the period ended September 30, 2024. Additionally,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 7.5 million in non-cash operating costs, including 5.9 million in increase
in derivative liability and 667 in amortization of convertible note costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized
 580,000 in non-cash operating costs, including 252,000 for stock-based settlement expense, 190,000 in stock-based compensation, and
 154,000 for depreciation.

 (99,209 

Net
cash used in operating activities 

Our
largest source of operating cash has been cash collected from sales of our products. Our primary use of cash in operating activities
has been for inventory purchases, salaries and benefits, legal and professional services, and sales and marketing. In the last several
years, we have generated negative cash flows from operating activities and supplemented working capital requirements through net proceeds
from sales of our Common stock. 

We
generated negative cash flows from operating activities of 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to negative
cash flows of 4.2 million for the same period in 2023. Factors affecting operating cash flows during both periods included: 

For
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our loss of 13.2 million was reduced by non-cash
 transactions including an increase in derivative liability of 5.9 million, amortization
 of convertible note costs of 667,000, and stock-based compensation of 546,000. For the
 nine months ended September 30, 2023, our loss of 5.3 million was reduced by non-cash transactions
 including a stock-based settlement of 252,000, stock-based compensation of 190,000, and
 depreciation of 154,000. 

Cash
 used for inventory and prepaid inventories decreased by 460,000 and 372,000 for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 is due to the
 timing of purchases there was an increase of 1.2 million of in-transit inventory offset
 by a decrease of 460,000 of inventory. The increase is primarily due to the timing of significant
 purchases and prepayments of inventory to Asian suppliers. Turnaround time for receiving
 inventory from foreign sources can take up to 120 days, with prepayments required. 

Cash
 used for an increase in accounts receivable was 284,000 and 156,000 for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales are generally collected within 30
 to 45 days. These changes are mainly due to the timing of invoices and payments before and
 after the end of the period. 

Cash
 used for an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was 89,000 and 46,000
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily
 due to increases in receivables from the sale of some fixed assets as well as an increase
 in prepaid freight, duties, and import fees. 

36 

Net
cash provided by investing activities 

Cash provided by investing activities was 122,000
and 17,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Purchases of 11,000 in 2024 were for quality assurance
equipment and purchases of 20,000 in 2023 included 11,000 for quality assurance testing equipment and 9,000 for improvements on vehicles.
We sold three vehicles as well as fixed assets associated with the property for which we terminated the lease during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and sold one vehicle during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by / (used in) financing activities 

Cash
provided by financing activities was 5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and cash used in financing activities
was 99,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds from
issuance of common stock of 9.5 million and from issuance of warrants of 31,000, offset by principal payments on the 3i Note of 2.8
million, principal payments on long-term debt of 109,000, and principal payments on stockholder promissory notes of 763,000. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made principal payments on long-term debt of 149,000, which was offset by net cash proceeds
of 50,000 from the exercise of warrants. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Overview 

Our
operations have been financed primarily through net proceeds from sales of our Common stock and equity and debt financings. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 2.0 million and 4.3 million, respectively, and we
had cash and cash equivalents of 3.3 million and 3.9 million, respectively. 

We
generally consider our short-term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred within the next twelve
months and believe those requirements to consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses, interest and principal payments
on our debt, and capital expenditures related to assembly line expansion. 

As of September 30, 2024, we expect our short-term
liquidity requirements to include (a) principal debt payments totaling approximately 32,000 net of amortization and (b) lease obligation
payments of approximately 317,000, including imputed interest. 

We generally consider our long-term liquidity requirements
to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred beyond the next twelve months and believe these requirements consist primarily
of funds necessary for eighteen months. 

Our activities are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding before we achieve sustainable revenues and profit from operations. We expect
to continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future, and we may need to raise additional debt or equity financing to expand
our presence in the marketplace, develop new products, achieve operating efficiencies, and accomplish our long-term business plans over
the next several years. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available
to us. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within twelve months from the date of issuance
of the financial statements for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. However, we are working to address our cash flow challenges,
including raising additional capital, managing inventory levels, identifying alternative supply chain resources, and managing operational
expenses. Refer to the risk factor entitled Our audited financial statements include a statement that there is a substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and a continuation of negative financial trends could result in our inability to
continue as a going concern in Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report.

purchase agreement with 3i, pursuant to which we sold, and 3i purchased, the 3i Note in the aggregate original principal amount of 2,750,000
(the Convertible Note Financing ). The gross proceeds to us were 2.5 million, prior to the payment of legal fees and transaction
expenses. On August 8, 2024, in connection with the closing of the August 2024 Public Offering, the Company repaid the 3i Note, and the
Company s obligations under the 3i Note were fully satisfied and discharged. Prior to the closing of the August 2024 Public Offering,

Equity Line of Credit 

On December 27, 2023, we entered into the Common Stock

up to the lesser of (a) 20,000,000 in aggregate gross purchase price of newly issued Common stock and (b) the Exchange Cap (as defined
in the purchase agreement) (the Equity Line of Credit ). In connection with the August 2024 Public Offering, the Company
and Tumim mutually agreed to terminate the Equity Line of Credit, effective immediately upon the closing of the August 2024 Public Offering.
Prior to the closing of the August 2024 Public Offering, the Company had sold 4,336 shares of common stock (post-Reverse Stock Split)
under the Equity Line of Credit for an aggregate amount of 828,491, of which 434,958 was used to repay a portion of the balance under
the 3i Note, consisting of 380,042 to the loan principal, 34,204 to interest, and 20,712 as a redemption premium. 

Stockholder Promissory Notes 

Stockholder promissory notes had an outstanding principal
balance of 0 as of September 30, 2024, as they were repaid in August 2024. See Note 6 Stockholder Promissory Notes 
in this Quarterly Report for further information on stockholder promissory notes. 

Vehicle Financing Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we had three notes payable
to GM Financial for vehicles. In addition, a commercial line secured in April 2022 for 300,000 was renewed in April 2023 for an increased
amount of 350,000 and renewed again in April 2024 for the same amount. This commercial line may be used to finance vehicle purchases
and expires in April 2025. The notes are payable in aggregate monthly installments of 2,560, including interest at rates ranging from
6.14 to 7.29 per annum, mature at various dates from October 2027 to May 2028, and are secured by the related vehicles. 

38 

Operating
Lease Liabilities 

Our estimated future obligations consist of total
operating lease liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 867,000 in total operating lease liabilities, including the current portion. 

Other Indebtedness 

As of September 30, 2024, our long-term debt totaled
 240,000, including the current portion, which consists of 144,000 outstanding under a COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan, 92,000
outstanding under vehicle financing arrangements, and an equipment loan for 4,000. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The
above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies. Critical accounting policies are those that we consider to be the most important in portraying our financial
condition and results of operations and also require the greatest number of judgments by management. Judgments or uncertainties regarding
the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different
assumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing
the financial statements. 

Inventory 

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or net realizable value and consists of batteries and accessories, resale items,
components, and related landing costs. The valuation of inventory includes fixed production overhead costs based on normal capacity of
the assembly warehouse. 

The
Company periodically reviews its inventory for evidence of slow-moving or obsolete inventory and provides for an allowance when considered
necessary. The Company determined that no such reserve was necessary as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company prepays
for inventory purchases from foreign suppliers and includes inventory in transit where title had passed to the Company but had not yet
been physically received. 

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. Betterments, renewals,
and extraordinary repairs that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized; other repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as
incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization applicable to assets retired are removed from the accounts,
and the gain or loss on disposition is recognized in the Statements of Operations. 

Leases 

The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use ROU assets represent the Company s
right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make
lease payments arising from the lease. Operating leases are included in ROU assets, current operating lease liabilities, and long-term
operating lease liabilities on the Company s Balance Sheets. The Company does not have any finance leases. The Company accounts
for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all its leases. 

39 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company s revenue is generated from the sale of products consisting primarily of batteries and accessories. The Company recognizes
revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it is expected
to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As such, accounts receivable is recorded at the time of shipment or will call,
when the Company s right to the consideration becomes unconditional and the Company determines there are no uncertainties regarding
payment terms or transfer of control. 

Shipping
and Handling Costs 

Shipping
and handling fees billed to customers are classified on the Statement of Operations as Net sales. Shipping and handling
costs for shipping product to customers are classified in selling, general, and administrative expense on the Statements of Operations. 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Statements of
Operations. 

Income
Taxes 

The
Company is a C corporation and its deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of exiting assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called for
by Item 304 of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, evaluated our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. The
term "disclosure controls and procedures," means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours is designed to do, and management necessarily is required to
apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In
addition, the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

40 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. We
are not currently party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 

On
September 6, 2024, the Company received a staff determination from The Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq to delist the Company s common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market indicating that (i) the Company was
not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the closing bid price per share for the Company s common stock had
closed below 1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business days, and (ii) the Company is subject to the provisions contemplated under
Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii) because, as of September 5, 2024, the Company s common stock had a closing bid price of
 0.10 or less for at least ten consecutive trading days (the Staff Determination ). 

On
September 12, 2024, the Company requested an appeal hearing on the Staff Determination from a Hearings Panel (the Panel by filing a hearing request with Nasdaq pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules, staying the delisting of the
Company s common stock pending the Panel s decision. 

Upon
successful completion of the Reverse Stock Split (as defined in Note 13), the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Office of General
Counsel on October 23, 2024, advising the Company that it had regained compliance with the minimum bid price continued listing requirements
in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and that the Company is therefore in compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. Consequently, the
scheduled hearing before the Panel on October 24, 2024, was cancelled. The Company s common stock continues to be
listed and traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

See
Note 13 Subsequent Events in this Quarterly Report for additional information about the Reverse Stock Split and
the Nasdaq Listing Requirement. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

An
investment in our Common stock involves risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all the information
within the section titles Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, 
as well as in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained within this Quarterly Report. In addition,
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in
Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report, as well as in our other public filings
with the SEC. If any of the identified risks are realized, our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and future
prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our Common stock may decline, and you could
lose all or part of your investment. In addition, other risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we do not currently view as
material, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and future prospects.

We are not aware of any material changes to the risks
and uncertainties described in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference, other
than as set forth below. 

41 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock and August 2024 Public Offering 

Sales
of substantial amounts of our securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock. 

Our
common stock is listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in
the public market, including the shares of common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Prefunded Warrants, Series A Warrants
and Series B Warrants issued in the August 2024 Public Offering, and shares issued as consideration in any future acquisitions, or the
market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our securities could fall and we may be unable to sell our securities
in the future. 

Although
our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the exchange could subsequently delist our common stock if we fail to comply
with ongoing listing standards. 

Our
common stock currently is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We are required to meet specified financial requirements in order to maintain
such listing, including a requirement that the bid price for our common stock remain above 1.00. 

On
September 6, 2024, as expected, the Company received the Staff Determination from Nasdaq to delist the Company s securities from
The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On
September 12, 2024, the Company requested an appeal hearing on the Staff Determination from the Panel by filing the Appeal, staying the
delisting of the common stock pending the Panel s decision. 

Upon
successful completion of the Reverse Stock Split (as defined in Note 13), the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq staff on October
23, 2024, advising the Company that it had regained compliance with the continued listing requirements in Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and
that the Company is therefore in compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. Consequently, the scheduled hearing before the Panel on
October 24, 2024, was cancelled. See Item I. Legal Proceedings in Part II of this Quarterly Report for further
information on the Staff Determination and Note 13 Subsequent Events for further information on the Reverse Stock
Split. 

While
the Company s common shares continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that the Company
will continue to meet Nasdaq listing standards. 

Any
potential delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market may have materially adverse consequences to our stockholders,
including: 

a
 reduced market price and liquidity with respect to our shares of common stock, which could
 make our ability to raise new investment capital more difficult; 

limited
 dissemination of the market price of our common stock; 

limited
 news coverage; 

limited
 interest by investors in our common stock; 

volatility
 of the prices of our common stock, due to low trading volume; 

our
 common stock being considered a penny stock, which would result in broker-dealers
 participating in sales of our common stock being subject to the regulations set forth in
 Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; 

increased
 difficulty in selling our common stock in certain states due to blue sky restrictions;
 and 

 limited
ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing. 

The
exercise of each Series A Warrant and, to a lesser extent, the Series B Warrants may result in a substantial increase in the number of
shares of our common stock that are outstanding. 

As of November 12, 2024, 114,996,768 Series A Warrants,
exercisable for 5,286,692 shares of common stock, at 5.206 per share (post-Reverse Stock Split and post-Adjustment), and 3,075,000 Series
B Warrants exercisable for 87,384 shares of common stock, at 0.10 per share (post-Reverse Stock Split and post-Adjustment) were outstanding
as of November 12, 2024. The exercise of the Series A Warrants and, to a lesser extent, the Series B Warrants could result in a substantial
increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding and therefore materially dilute the ownership percentage of currently outstanding
shares of common stock. 

42 

Provisions
of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants we sold in the August 2024 Public Offering may discourage an acquisition of us by a third-party. 

Certain
provisions of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants we sold in the August 2024 Public Offering could make it more difficult or
expensive for a third-party to acquire us. The Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants each prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions
constituting fundamental transactions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the
applicable warrants. These and other provisions of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants could prevent or deter a third-party from
acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our investors. 

The Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants
may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to affect a business combination. 

To the extent we issue shares of common stock to affect
a future business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock upon exercise
of the Series A Warrants and, to a lesser extent, the Series B Warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes
of a target business. Such Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding
shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, the Series A and Series
B Warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring a target business. Additionally,
the sale, or even the possibility of a sale, of the shares of common stock underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants, Series A Warrants, and
Series B Warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If
and to the extent the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants are exercised, our investors may experience dilution to their holdings. 

The Reverse Stock Split cash true-up payment
provision in the Series A Warrants we sold in the August 2024 Public Offering may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition,
may impede our ability to raise additional capital, and may discourage an acquisition of us by a third party 

As a result of the VWAP of the common stock during
the five trading days before and after the Reverse Stock Split, the Revers Stock Split cash true-up payment provision in the Series A
Warrants, which is capped at 5 million in the aggregate under all Series A Warrants, was triggered, but the payment of the Reverse Stock
Split cash true-up payment is currently suspended in accordance with the terms of the Series A Warrants. The obligation to make the Reverse
Stock Split cash true-up payment could impede our ability to raise additional capital and could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring
us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our investors. In the event that the conditions for suspension of the Reverse Stock
Split cash true-up payment under the terms of the Series A Warrants become no longer applicable, the payment of the Reverse Stock Split
cash true-up payment could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
