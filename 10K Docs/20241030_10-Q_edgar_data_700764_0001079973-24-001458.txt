 through June 30, 2024, and has a working capital deficit of ) at
June 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
after the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments
that might result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company anticipates that operating losses will
continue in the near term as its management continues its efforts to raise additional capital and pursue the development and implementation
of clean, sustainable low-cost energy solutions with applications across various industries, including transportation, power generation,
and industrial processes. Based upon anticipated new sources of capital, and cash flow from operations, it believes it will have enough
capital to cover expenses through at least the next twelve months. The Company will continue to monitor liquidity carefully, and in the
event it does not have enough capital to cover expenses, the Company will make the necessary and appropriate reductions in spending to
remain cash flow positive. While management believes its plans, including the Merger, help mitigate the substantial doubt that they are
a going concern, there is no guarantee that the Company s plans will be successful or if they are, will fully alleviate the conditions
that raise substantial doubt that the Company is a going concern.

We caution readers that important facts and factors described in MD A and elsewhere in this document sometimes have affected, and

CAUTIONARY INFORMATION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Many statements made in the following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements
of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of federal securities laws and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed
future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan, strategies and capital structure. In particular, the words
 anticipate, expect, suggests, plan, believe, intend, 
 estimates, targets, projects, should, could, would, 
 may, will, forecast, variations of such words, and other similar expressions identify forward-looking
statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking.
We base these forward-looking statements or projections on our current expectations, plans and assumptions that we have made in light
of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and
other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances and at such time. As you read and consider this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. The forward-looking statements and projections
are subject to and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections
are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they are made, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial
results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements
and projections. Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include: 

16 

continued operating losses; 

adverse developments in economic conditions and, particularly, in conditions in the alternate energy industry; 

volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets; 

our inability to successfully execute on our growth strategy; 

the competitive nature of our industry; 

price increases or business interruptions in our supply of raw materials; 

failure to develop and market new products and manage product life cycles; 

business disruptions, security threats and security breaches, including security risks to our information technology systems; 

terrorist acts, conflicts, wars, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; 

failure to comply with anti-terrorism laws and regulations and applicable trade embargoes; 

risks associated with protecting data privacy; 

litigation and other commitments and contingencies; 

ability to recruit and retain the experienced and skilled personnel we need to compete; 

delays in obtaining permits by our future customers or acquisition targets for their operations; 

our ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights; 

intellectual property infringement suits against us by third parties; 

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions and divestitures; 

risk that the insurance we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures; 

risks associated with changes in tax rates or regulations, including unexpected impacts of the new U.S. TCJA legislation, which may differ with further regulatory guidance and changes in our current interpretations and assumptions; 

risks associated with geopolitical instability, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, and growing tensions between U.S. and China and neighboring regions; 

our ability to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms may be limited; 

any statements of belief and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; 

other factors disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; 

and other factors beyond our control. 

These cautionary statements should not be construed
by you to be exhaustive and are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as expressly required by the federal
securities laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, changed circumstances or any other reason. Potential investors should not make an investment decision based solely on our
projections, estimates or expectations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Going Concern 

Historically we have experienced, and we continue
to experience, net losses, net losses from operations, negative cash flow from operating activities, and working capital deficits. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of issuance of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that
might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

We anticipate that operating losses will continue
in the near term. We intend to meet near-term obligations with private placement offerings. We currently have no revenue from operations. 

In addition to the commitment of 4,000,000 from Flagstaff,
we will be required to obtain other liquidity resources in order to support ongoing operations. We are addressing this need by developing
additional capital sources, to enable us to execute our growth plan involving the use of proprietary technology to produce low-cost Green
Hydrogen from a wide variety of biomass sources. 

While management believes our business plans help
mitigate the substantial doubt that we are a going concern, there is no guarantee that our plans will be successful or if they are, will
fully alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt that we are a going concern. 

Capital Resources 

On January 1, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement
with Flagstaff International, LLC under which Flagstaff committed to invest 4,000,000 in Victory in exchange for 67,797 Shares of Victory
Series E Preferred Stock. As of June 30, 2024, Flagstaff has invested 1,442,500 As of October 28, 2024, Flagstaff has invested 1,772,500.
The Company is currently reliant on this agreement to fund its current operations. 

Material Cash Requirements 

Our material short-term cash requirements include
recurring payroll and benefits obligations for our employees, capital, operating expenditures, IP purchase/license payments and other
working capital needs. We believe that material cash requirements for operating expenditures may range from 300,000 per month to 400,000
per month during the twelve months. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition.

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and principal financial officer,
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation,
our principle executive officer and principal financial officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

21 

Changes in Internal Controls 

We regularly review our system of internal control
over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that
we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the six months ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
