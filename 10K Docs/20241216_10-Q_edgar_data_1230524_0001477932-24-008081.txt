Management believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. 8 Table of Contents from the royalty interest we acquired in the Eagle Acquisition consummated in January 2024. The royalty interest provides the Company with a monthly distribution of its share or revenues from the property, net of expenses and operational risks, from an oil production property managed by a non-affiliated third party. Since its incorporation, the Company has financed its operations through advances from its controlling shareholders, third-party convertible debt, and the sale of its common stock. Management s plans are to finance operations through the sale of equity or other investments for the foreseeable future, as the Company does not receive significant revenue from its business operations. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in arranging financing on acceptable terms. The Company s ability to raise additional capital is affected by trends and uncertainties beyond its control. The Company does not currently have any arrangements for financing, and it may not be able to find such financing if required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including investor sentiment. Market factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable to it. Since the transfer of controlling interest in August 2023, Zenith Energy Ltd. Zenith Energy ), the Company s controlling stockholder, has provided approximately capital in the form of payment made on behalf of the Company. Zenith Energy has indicated that intends to continue to finance the Company and its expansion into the energy sector, to acquire additional royalties and/or ownership interest, pending the receipt of additional financing. To sustain its ability to support the Company s operating activities, the Company may have to consider supplementing its available sources of funds through the following sources: (1) cash generated from upcoming operations; (2) new bank loans , (3) financial support from the Company s shareholder and related party. Based on the above analysis, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company can meet its obligations as they become due within one year from the reporting date and can continue as a going concern.
