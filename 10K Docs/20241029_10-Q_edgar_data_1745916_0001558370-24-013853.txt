The Servicing Agreement provides for servicing fees of per-loan monthly amounts based on the delinquency, bankruptcy and/or foreclosure status of the serviced loan or the real estate acquired in settlement of loans REO ). The Company is also entitled to customary ancillary income and market-based fees and charges relating to loans it services for PMT.

The base servicing fee rates are per month for fixed-rate loans and per month for adjustable-rate loans.

 Special servicing The Servicing Agreement expires on June 30, 2025, subject to automatic renewal for additional 18-month periods, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. Investment Management Activities The Company has a management agreement with PMT (the Management Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company oversees PMT s business affairs in conformity with PMT s investment policies for which the Company collects a base management fee and may collect a performance incentive fee. The Management Agreement provides that: The base management fee is calculated quarterly and is equal to the sum of (i) per year of PMT s average shareholders equity up to billion, (ii) per year of PMT s average shareholders equity in excess of billion and up to billion, and (iii) per year of PMT s average shareholders equity in excess of billion. The performance incentive fee is calculated quarterly at a defined annualized percentage of the amount by which PMT s net income, on a rolling four-quarter basis and before deducting the incentive fee, exceeds certain levels of return on equity. The performance incentive fee is equal to the sum of: of the amount by which PMT s net income for the quarter exceeds (i) an return on equity plus the high watermark, up to (ii) a return on PMT s equity plus of the amount by which PMT s net income for the quarter exceeds (i) a return on PMT s equity plus the high watermark, up to (ii) a return on PMT s equity plus of the amount by which PMT s net income for the quarter exceeds a return on equity plus the high watermark. For the purpose of determining the amount of the performance incentive fee: Net income is defined as net income or loss attributable to PMT s common shares of beneficial interest computed in accordance with GAAP adjusted for certain other non-cash charges determined after discussions between the Company and PMT s independent trustees and approval by a majority of PMT s independent trustees. Equity is the weighted average of the issue price per common share of beneficial interest of all of PMT s public offerings, multiplied by the weighted average number of PMT s common shares of beneficial interest outstanding (including restricted share units) in the rolling four-quarter period.

If the net income is higher than the Target Yield, the high watermark is reduced by the difference. Each time a performance incentive fee is earned, the high watermark returns to . As a result, the threshold amounts required for the Company to earn a performance incentive fee are adjusted cumulatively based on the performance of PMT s net income over (or under) the Target Yield, until the net income in excess of the Target Yield exceeds the then-current cumulative high watermark amount, and a performance incentive fee is earned. The base management fee and the performance incentive fee are both receivable quarterly in arrears. The performance incentive fee may be paid in cash or a combination of cash and PMT s common shares of beneficial interest (subject to a limit of no more than paid in common shares of beneficial interest), at PMT s option. In the event of termination of the Management Agreement between PMT and the Company, the Company may be entitled to a termination fee in certain circumstances. The termination fee is equal to three times the sum of (a) the average annual base management fee, and (b) the average annual performance incentive fee earned by the Company, in each case during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of termination. Following is a summary of the base management and performance incentive fees earned from PMT: Performance incentive Expense Reimbursement Under the Management Agreement, PMT reimburses the Company for its organizational and operating expenses, including third-party expenses, incurred on PMT s behalf, it being understood that the Company and its affiliates shall allocate a portion of their personnel s time to provide certain legal, tax and investor relations services for the direct benefit of PMT. With respect to the allocation of the Company s and its affiliates personnel compensation, the Company is reimbursed per fiscal quarter, such amount to be reviewed annually and not preclude reimbursement for any other services performed by the Company or its affiliates. PMT is also required to pay its pro rata portion of the rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of the Company and its affiliates required for PMT s and its subsidiaries operations. These expenses are allocated based on the ratio of PMT s proportion of gross assets compared to all remaining gross assets owned or managed by the Company as calculated at each fiscal quarter end.

 The following table summarizes the losses recognized on assets when they were remeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis: ) ) ) Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Amortized Cost The Company s Assets sold under agreements to repurchase , Mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements, Notes payable secured by mortgage servicing assets and Unsecured senior notes are carried at amortized cost. These liabilities are classified as Level 3 fair value items due to the Company s reliance on unobservable inputs to estimate their fair values. The Company has concluded that the fair values of these liabilities other than term notes and term loans included in Notes payable secured by mortgage servicing assets and the Unsecured senior notes approximate their carrying values due to their short terms and/or variable interest rates. The Company estimates the fair value of the term notes, term loans and the Unsecured senior notes using indications of fair value provided by non-affiliate brokers, pricing services and internal estimates of fair value. The fair values and carrying values of these liabilities are summarized below: Unsecured senior notes Valuation Governance Most of the Company s non-cash financial assets, and all of its derivatives, MSRs and MSLs, are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. Certain of the Company s financial assets and derivatives and all of its MSRs and MSLs are Level 3 fair value assets and liabilities which require use of unobservable inputs that are significant to the estimation of the items fair values. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own judgments about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, and are based on the best information available under the circumstances. Due to the difficulty in estimating the fair values of Level 3 fair value assets and liabilities, the Company has assigned responsibility for estimating the fair values of these assets and liabilities to specialized staff within its capital markets group and subjects the valuation process to significant senior management oversight.

 (1) Weighted average inputs are based on the fair values of the Level 3 fair value loans. (2) Voluntary prepayment/resale speed is measured using life voluntary Conditional Prepayment Rate CPR ). (3) Total prepayment/resale speed is measured using life total CPR, which includes both voluntary and involuntary prepayment/resale speeds. 
 Changes in fair value of loans held for sale attributable to changes in a loan s instrument-specific credit risk are measured with reference to the change in the respective loan s delinquency status and performance history at period end from the later of the beginning of the period or acquisition date. Changes in fair value of loans held for sale are included in Net gains on loans held for sale at fair value in the Company s consolidated statements of income. Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rate Lock Commitments The Company categorizes IRLCs as Level 3 fair value assets or liabilities. The Company estimates the fair values of IRLCs based on quoted Agency MBS prices, its estimate of the fair value of the MSRs it expects to receive in the sale of the loans and the probability that the loans will be funded or purchased (the pull-through rate ). The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s IRLCs are the pull-through rate and the estimated fair values of MSRs attributable to the mortgage loans it has committed to originate or purchase. Significant changes in the pull-through rate or the MSR components of the IRLCs, in isolation, could result in significant changes in the IRLCs fair value measurements. The financial effects of changes in these inputs are generally inversely correlated as increasing interest rates have a positive effect on the fair value of the MSR component of IRLC fair value, but increase the pull-through rate for the loan principal and interest payment cash flow component, which has decreased in fair value. Changes in fair value of IRLCs are included in Net gains on loans held for sale at fair value in the Company s consolidated statements of income.

 Hedging Derivatives Fair values of derivative financial instruments actively traded on exchanges are categorized by the Company as Level 1 fair value assets and liabilities; fair values of derivative financial instruments based on observable interest rates, volatilities and prices in the MBS or other markets are categorized by the Company as Level 2 fair value assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair values of hedging derivatives are included in Net gains on loans held for sale at fair value, or Net loan servicing fees Mortgage servicing rights hedging results , as applicable, in the Company s consolidated statements of income . Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are categorized as Level 3 fair value assets. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of MSRs. The key inputs used in the estimation of the fair value of MSRs include the applicable prepayment rate (prepayment speed), pricing spread (discount rate), and annual per-loan cost to service the underlying loans, all of which are unobservable. Significant changes to any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significant change in the MSR fair value measurement. Changes in these key inputs are not directly related. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are included in Net loan servicing fees Change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing liabilities in the Company s consolidated statements of income.

 of the borrowing facilities secured by loans held for sale are in the form of mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements. Participation certificates, each of which represents an undivided beneficial ownership interest in mortgage loans that have been pooled with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae, are sold to a lender pending securitization of the mortgage loans and sale of the resulting securities. A commitment to sell the securities resulting from the pending securitization between the Company and a non-affiliate is also assigned to the lender at the time a participation certificate is sold. The purchase price paid by the lender for each participation certificate is based on the trade price of the security, plus an amount of interest expected to accrue on the security to its anticipated delivery date, minus a present value adjustment, any related hedging costs and a holdback amount that is based on a percentage of the purchase price.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the words we, us, our and the Company refer to PFSI and its subsidiaries. Our Company We are a specialty financial services firm primarily focused on the production and servicing of U.S. residential mortgage loans (activities which we refer to as mortgage banking) and the management of investments related to the U.S. mortgage market. We believe that our operating capabilities, specialized expertise, access to long-term investment capital, and the experience of our management team across all aspects of the mortgage business will allow us to profitably engage in these activities and capitalize on other related opportunities as they arise in the future. Our primary assets are equity interests in Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC PNMAC ). We are the managing member of PNMAC, and we operate and control all of the businesses and affairs of PNMAC, and consolidate the financial results of PNMAC and its subsidiaries. We conduct our business in three segments: production, servicing (together, production and servicing comprise our mortgage banking activities) and investment management: The production segment performs loan origination, acquisition and sale activities. The servicing segment performs loan servicing for both newly originated loans we are holding for sale and loans we service for others, including for PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust, a mortgage real estate investment trust separately listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PMT , as well as provides other ancillary services to our customers. The investment management segment represents our investment management activities relating to PMT, which include the activities associated with investment asset acquisitions and dispositions such as sourcing, due diligence, negotiation and settlement. Our principal mortgage banking subsidiary, PennyMac Loan Services, LLC PLS ), is a non-bank producer and servicer of mortgage loans in the United States. PLS is a seller/servicer for the Federal National Mortgage Association Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac ), each of which is a government-sponsored entity. PLS is also an approved issuer of securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association Ginnie Mae ), a lender of the Federal Housing Administration FHA ), and a lender/servicer of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA ). We refer to each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA and USDA as an Agency and collectively as the Agencies. PLS is able to service loans in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and originate loans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, either because PLS is properly licensed in a particular jurisdiction or exempt or otherwise not required to be licensed in that jurisdiction. Our investment management subsidiary is PNMAC Capital Management, LLC PCM ), a Delaware limited liability company registered with the Securities Exchange Commission SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

 Business Trends The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun to reduce the federal funds rate from its highest level since 2007 as inflationary pressures have abated, and longer term interest rates have declined slightly from their most elevated levels in recent years. Elevated interest rates have constrained growth in the size of the mortgage origination market from 1.5 trillion in 2023 to an estimated 1.7 trillion in 2024, but declining interest rates and increased refinancing activity are projected to drive growth in the origination market to 2.3 trillion in 2025 according to mortgage origination economists. Declining interest rates and increasing opportunity for refinancing have driven increased mortgage production activity in the most recent quarter and also led to increasing prepayment speeds on our mortgage servicing portfolio from the historically slow prepayment speeds experienced earlier in the year. Higher interest rate levels have increased the costs of floating rate borrowings and interest income from placement fees we receive relating to custodial funds that we manage on deposits and loans held for sale as compared to the same period in the prior year, although we would expect these to begin declining as well as if the Federal Reserve continues to reduce the federal funds rate as expected. We continued our acquisition of conventional loans from PMT during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and expect to purchase conventional loans from PMT during the remainder of 2024.

 (1) To provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ), we disclose Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure that is frequently used in our industry to measure performance and we believe that this measure provides supplemental information that is useful to investors. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

 59 

Table of Contents 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding decrease (increase) in fair value of mortgage servicing rights MSRs net of mortgage servicing liabilities MSLs ), due to changes in the valuation inputs we use in our valuation models, hedging (gains) losses associated with MSRs, stock-based compensation and interest expense on corporate debt or corporate revolving credit facilities and capital lease. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. However, other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently, and as a result, our measures of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: a) they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; b) they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt; and c) they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA measures are not intended as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our operating performance and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for each of the periods indicated:

The decrease was primarily due to a 109.5 million decrease in Net loan servicing fees resulting from increases in net MSR valuation losses in excess of growth in servicing fees and a 44.4 million increase in total expenses, partially offset by a 123.1 million increase in loan production revenue due to higher volume across all production channels.

Table of Contents 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income before provision for income taxes increased 33.8 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 215.0 million increase in loan production revenues due to higher volume across all production channels, partially offset by a 135.9 million decrease in Net loan servicing fees resulting from increases in net MSR valuation losses in excess of growth in servicing fees and a 50.1 million increase in total expenses. Net Gains on Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value In our production segment, revenues reflect the effects of a reduction in market interest rates and mortgage rates from elevated levels during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recognized Net gains on loans held for sale at fair value totaling 256.8 million, an increase of 105.4 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due to an increase in loan production volume across all production channels due to a reduction in interest rates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized Net gains on loans held for sale at fair value totaling 595.3 million, an increase of 198.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher margins and increases in loan production volumes across all production channels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

Table of Contents 
 Non-Cash Elements of Gain on Sale of Loans Held for Sale Our gains on loans held for sale include both cash and non-cash elements. We recognize a significant portion of our gains on loans held for sale when we make commitments to purchase or fund mortgage loans. We recognize this gain in the form of interest rate lock commitment IRLC derivatives. We adjust our initial gain amount as the loan purchase or origination process progresses until the loan is either funded or cancelled. We also receive non-cash proceeds on sale that include our estimate of the fair value of MSRs and we incur MSLs (which represent the fair value of the costs we expect to incur in excess of the fees we receive for delinquent loans we have bought out of Ginnie Mae guaranteed securities we service and have resold to third party investors) and for the fair value of our estimate of the losses we expect to incur relating to the representations and warranties we provide in our loan sale transactions. The MSRs, MSLs, and liabilities for representations and warranties we recognize represent our estimate of the fair value of future benefits and costs we will realize for years in the future. These estimates represented approximately 225 and 257 of our gains on sales of loans held for sale at fair value for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 297 and 327 for the same periods in 2023. These estimates change as circumstances change and changes in these estimates are recognized in income in subsequent periods. Subsequent changes in the fair value of our MSRs may significantly affect our income. Interest Rate Lock Commitments, Mortgage Servicing Rights and Mortgage Servicing Liabilities The methods and key inputs we use to measure and update our measurements of IRLCs, MSRs and MSLs are detailed in Note 7 Fair Value Valuation Techniques and Inputs to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. Representations and Warranties Our agreements with the purchasers and insurers of our loans include representations and warranties related to the loans. The representations and warranties require adherence to purchaser and insurer origination and underwriting guidelines, including but not limited to the validity of the lien securing the loan, property eligibility, borrower credit, income and asset requirements, and compliance with applicable federal, state and local law. In the event of a breach of our representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the loans with the identified defects or indemnify the purchaser or insurer. In such cases, we bear any subsequent credit losses on the loans. Our credit losses may be reduced by any recourse we have to correspondent originators that sold such loans to us and breached similar or other representations and warranties. In such event, we have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from that correspondent seller. Our representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits of exposure. However, we believe that the current unpaid principal balance UPB of loans sold by us and subject to representation and warranty liability to date represents our maximum representations and warranties exposure. The level of the liability for losses under representations and warranties is difficult to estimate and requires considerable judgment. The level of loan repurchase losses is dependent on economic factors, purchaser or insurer loss mitigation strategies, and other external conditions that may change over the lives of the underlying loans. Our estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is developed by our credit administration staff and approved by our senior management credit committee which includes senior management in our loan production, loan servicing and credit risk management areas. The method we use to estimate our losses on representations and warranties is a function of our estimate of future defaults, loan repurchase rates, the severity of loss in the event of default, if applicable, and the probability of reimbursement by the correspondent loan seller. We establish a liability at our estimate of its fair value at the time loans are sold and review the adequacy of our recorded liability on a periodic basis.

 We recorded provisions for losses under representations and warranties relating to current loan sales as a component of Net gains on loans held for sale at fair value totaling 4.1 million and 12.2 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.0 million and 8.9 million for the same periods in 2023. The increases in the provision relating to current loan sales were primarily attributable to an increase in production volume for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. We also recorded reductions in the liability of 3.5 million and 10.9 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.6 million and 6.0 million for the same periods in 2023. The reductions in the liability resulted from previously sold loans meeting performance criteria established by the Agencies which significantly limit the likelihood of certain repurchase or indemnification claims. Following is a summary of loan repurchase activity and the UPB of loans subject to representations and warranties: 

Quarter ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) During the period: Indemnification activity: Loans indemnified at beginning of period 94,982 53,866 75,724 35,961 New indemnifications 5,129 11,681 27,142 31,509 Less indemnified loans sold, repaid or refinanced 1,225 593 3,980 2,516 Loans indemnified at end of period 98,886 64,954 98,886 64,954 Repurchase activity: Total loans repurchased 25,837 14,598 70,700 39,695 Less: Loans repurchased by correspondent lenders 21,678 7,488 47,459 16,400 Loans repaid by borrowers or resold 10,895 9,483 22,630 66,899 Net loans (resolved) repurchased with losses chargeable to liability for representations and warranties (6,736) (2,373) 611 (43,604) Losses charged to liability for representations and warranties 991 1,114 3,776 4,810 At end of period: Unpaid principal balance of loans subject to representations and warranties 396,102,491 335,044,546 Liability for representations and warranties 28,286 30,491 During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased loans totaling 25.8 million and 70.0 million, respectively. We charged losses of 1.0 million and 3.8 million to the liability during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Our losses arising from representations and warranties have historically been minimized by our ability to either recover most of the losses from our correspondent sellers or from our ability to profitably refinance and resell repurchased loans. Elevated interest rate levels may affect certain of our correspondent sellers ability to honor their obligations to repurchase defective loans, may increase the level of borrower defaults and may increase the level of repurchases we are required to make, thereby making it more difficult to minimize losses on repurchased loans. We expect these developments may increase the losses we incur in relation to our recorded liability for representations and warranties compared to our historical experience. However, we believe our recorded liability is presently adequate to absorb such losses.

 Loan Origination Fees Loan origination fees increased 11.7 million and 19.8 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in production volume. Fulfillment Fees from PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust Fulfillment fees from PMT represent fees we collect for services we perform on behalf of PMT in connection with the acquisition, packaging and sale of loans. The fulfillment fees are calculated based on the number of loans we fulfill for PMT. Fulfillment fees increased 6.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023; the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of loans we fulfilled for PMT during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Fulfillment fees decreased 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023; the decrease was primarily due to PMT s sale of a greater proportion of conventional correspondent loans to us during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net Loan Servicing Fees Our net loan servicing fee income has two primary components: fees earned for servicing the loans and the effects of MSR and MSL valuation changes, net of hedging results as summarized below:

These fees are contractually established at an annualized percentage of the UPB of the loan serviced and we collect these fees from borrower payments. Loan servicing fees from PMT are primarily related to PMT s MSRs and are established at monthly per-loan amounts based on whether the loan is a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan and the loan s delinquency or foreclosure status as detailed in Note 5 Transactions with Related Parties to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. Other loan servicing fees are comprised primarily of borrower-contracted fees such as late charges and reconveyance fees.

 Loan servicing fees from non-affiliates and other fees increased during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase was primarily due to growth of our loan servicing portfolio. Other servicing fees increased due to growth in our MSR portfolio combined with increased incentives received for loss mitigation activities and recovery of servicing premiums from correspondent sellers for loans that paid off within a short period after origination. Effects of Mortgage Servicing Rights and Mortgage Servicing Liabilities We have elected to carry our servicing assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value have two components: changes due to realization of the contractual servicing fees and changes due to changes in market inputs used to estimate the fair value of MSRs and MSLs. We endeavor to moderate the effects of changes in fair value by entering into derivatives transactions and holding principal-only stripped mortgage-backed securities. Change in fair value of MSRs and MSLs and the related hedging results are summarized below: 

Quarter ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) MSR and MSL valuation changes and hedging results: Changes in fair value attributable to changes in fair value inputs (402,422) 398,871 (133,018) 427,512 Hedging results 242,051 (423,656) (224,371) (531,565) (160,371) (24,785) (357,389) (104,053) Changes in fair value attributable to realization of cash flows (225,836) (177,775) (625,140) (498,120) Total change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing liabilities net of hedging results (386,207) (202,560) (982,529) (602,173) Average balances: Mortgage servicing rights 7,863,603 6,787,100 7,649,661 6,342,508 Mortgage servicing liabilities 1,705 1,890 1,732 1,976 At end of period: Mortgage servicing rights 7,752,292 7,084,356 Mortgage servicing liabilities 1,718 1,818 Changes in fair value of MSRs attributable to changes in fair value inputs decreased during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The decreases were due to decreases in interest rates during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to increasing interest rates during the same periods in 2023. Increasing interest rates reduce the rate of prepayments of the underlying loans, which increases the cash flows expected from the servicing rights, while decreasing interest rates have the opposite effect. Hedging results reflect valuation losses attributable to the effects of interest rate decreases on the fair value of the hedging instruments as well as increased net exposure to interest rate volatility to limit elevated hedge costs during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and in the same periods in 2023. Changes in fair value attributable to realization of cash flows are influenced by changes in the level of servicing assets and liabilities and changes in estimates of the remaining cash flows to be realized. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, realization of cash flows increased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the growth in our investment in MSRs.

The decreases were primarily due to an increase in interest expense on borrowings due to the higher interest rate environment and to growth in our balance sheet, partially offset by an increase in placement fees we receive relating to custodial funds that we manage primarily due to increased average custodial deposit balances. Management Fees from PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust Management fees decreased 22,000 and 36,000 during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, due to decreases in average PMT s shareholders equity which is the basis for the base management fees.

 Expenses Compensation Compensation expenses are summarized below: 

Quarter ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Salaries and wages 98,679 93,788 283,827 279,263 Severance 177 10 837 3,326 Incentive compensation 34,791 36,447 93,891 80,178 Taxes and benefits 18,726 17,850 59,779 58,220 Stock and unit-based compensation 18,943 8,814 21,314 20,839 171,316 156,909 459,648 441,826 Head count: Average 4,150 4,176 4,015 4,162 Period end 4,309 4,129 Compensation expenses increased 14.4 million and 17.8 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to an increase in stock and unit-based compensation during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting increased performance attainment expectations, and increased incentive compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting higher loan production volume. Loan Origination Loan origination expenses increased 16.3 million and 28.4 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher origination volumes. Servicing Servicing expenses increased 15.6 million and 27.3 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to an increase in provision for losses on servicing advances resulting from higher delinquent loan balances during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Professional Services Professional expenses decreased 2.6 million and 22.8 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased legal expenses related to the Black Knight litigation discussed in Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rates were 26.1 and 23.8 during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 26.8 and 23.7 during the same periods in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is attributable to an increase in tax deductions realized for stock options exercised in the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 (1) Tangible stockholders equity represents total stockholders equity reduced by intangible assets, comprised of capitalized software, for the dates presented. Total assets increased 4.0 billion from 18.8 billion at December 31, 2023 to 22.9 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 2.1 billion in loans held for sale at fair value, an increase of 960.3 million in principal-only stripped mortgage-backed securities at fair value, an increase of 652.9 million in MSRs, and an increase of 622.4 million of loans eligible for repurchase, partially offset by a decrease in cash and short-term investments of 134.9 million and a decrease in servicing advances of 293.3 million. Total liabilities increased 3.8 billion from 15.3 billion at December 31, 2023 to 19.1 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 3.4 billion in borrowings to fund our inventory of loans held for sale, MBS and MSRs and an increase of 622.4 million in liability for loans eligible for repurchase, partially offset by a decrease of 127.2 million in payable to PMT and a decrease of 118.4 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses. As a result of our increased inventory financing requirements, our leverage ratios increased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023.

Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities totaled 2.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash used in operating activities of 2.0 billion during the same period in 2023. Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by changes in the levels of our inventory of mortgage loans held for sale as shown below: 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Cash flows from: Loans held for sale (3,057,952) (2,619,743) Other operating sources 673,418 607,235 (2,384,534) (2,012,508) Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1.8 billion, primarily due to 935.4 million in purchases of principal-only stripped mortgage-backed securities, a 657.7 million increase in short-term investment and 210.2 million in net settlement of derivative financial instruments used to hedge our investment in MSRs. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 378.0 million, primarily due to 450.2 million in net settlement of derivative financial instruments used to hedge our investment in MSRs and 27.7 million used in acquisition of capitalized software, partially offset by 98.1 million received from the sale of interest-only stripped securities. Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 3.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase of 3.4 billion in borrowings. The increase in borrowings primarily reflects the increase in inventory of loans held for sale, principal-only stripped mortgage-backed securities and our investment in MSRs. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 2.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of 2.4 billion in borrowings. The increase in borrowings primarily reflects the increase in inventory of loans held for sale and our investment in MSRs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity reflects our ability to meet our current obligations (including our operating expenses and, when applicable, the retirement of, and margin calls relating to, our debt, and margin calls relating to hedges on our commitments to purchase or originate mortgage loans and on our MSR investments), fund new originations and purchases, and make investments as we identify them. We expect our primary sources of liquidity to be through cash flows from business activities, proceeds from bank borrowings and proceeds from and issuance of equity or debt offerings. We believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs. Our current borrowing strategy is to finance our assets where we believe such borrowing is prudent, appropriate and available. Our primary borrowing activities are in the form of sales of assets under agreements to repurchase, sales of mortgage loan participation purchase and sale certificates, notes payable secured by mortgage servicing rights and unsecured senior notes. A significant amount of our borrowings have short-term maturities and provide for advances with terms ranging from 30 days to 364 days. Because a significant portion of our current debt facilities consist of short-term debt, we expect to renew these facilities in advance of maturity in order to ensure our ongoing liquidity and access to capital or otherwise allow ourselves sufficient time to replace any necessary financing. Secured debt facilities for MSRs and servicing advances take various forms. Fannie Mae MSRs, Ginnie Mae MSRs and servicing advances are pledged to special purpose entities, each of which may issue variable funding notes VFNs and term notes and term loans that are secured by such Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae assets. Term notes are issued to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of Securities Act and term loans are syndicated to banking entities, while the VFNs are sold to bank partners under agreements to repurchase. Freddie Mac MSR s are pledged to a single lender under a bi-lateral loan and security agreement. On February 29, 2024, the Company through its indirect subsidiary, PNMAC GMSR ISSUER TRUST (the Issuer Trust ), issued an aggregate principal amount of 425 million in secured term notes (the 2024-GT1 Notes to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The 2024-GT1 Notes will mature on March 26, 2029 or, if extended, either March 25, 2030 or March, 25, 2031. The 2024-GT1 Notes rank pari passu with other secured term notes issued by the Issuer Trust and are secured by certain participation certificates relating to Ginnie Mae mortgage servicing rights and excess servicing spread relating to such mortgage servicing rights that are financed by PLS. On May 23, 2024, the Company, together with its subsidiaries, issued 650 million in 7.125 unsecured senior notes due in 2030 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. On July 25, 2024, the Company, the Issuer Trust and PLS entered into two VFN repurchase agreements, as part of the structured finance transaction that PLS uses to finance Ginnie Mae mortgage servicing rights and related excess servicing spread and servicing advance receivables. The Series 2024-MSRVF1 Master Repurchase Agreement by and between PLS, as seller, and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. Mizuho ), as administrative agent and as a buyer, is related to the excess servicing spread. The Series 2020-SPIADVF1 Master Repurchase Agreement by and between PLS, as seller, and Mizuho, as administrative agent and buyer, is related to the servicing advance receivables. The maximum amount outstanding under both repurchase agreements is 350 million and each agreement is set to expire on July 25, 2026. Our repurchase agreements represent the sales of assets together with agreements for us to buy back the respective assets at a later date. The table below presents the average, maximum daily and ending balances: 

Quarter ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Average balance 5,638,124 3,208,434 4,982,988 3,800,502 Maximum daily balance 6,608,245 4,418,359 7,122,796 6,358,007 Balance at period end 6,609,703 4,418,297 The differences between the average and maximum daily balances on our repurchase agreements reflect both the effect of increasing loan inventory levels during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the 

 72 

Table of Contents 
 fluctuations throughout the periods of our inventory as we fund and pool mortgage loans for sale in guaranteed mortgage securitizations. Our repurchase agreements also contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender at its option, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. A margin deficit will generally result from any decrease in the market value (as determined by the applicable lender) of the assets subject to the related financing agreement. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice. Our secured financing agreements at PLS require us to comply with various financial and other restrictive covenants. The most significant financial covenants currently include the following: a minimum in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 100 million; a minimum tangible net worth of 1.25 billion; a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to tangible net worth of 10:1; and at least one other warehouse or repurchase facility that finances amounts and assets that are similar to those being financed under certain of our existing secured financing agreements. With respect to servicing performed for PMT, PLS is also subject to certain covenants under PMT s debt agreements. Covenants in PMT s debt agreements are equally, or sometimes less, restrictive than the covenants described above. PFSI issued unsecured senior notes (the Unsecured Notes to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by the Company s existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries defined in the indentures under which the Unsecured Notes were issued). Our Unsecured Notes indentures contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the Company and our restricted subsidiaries ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including, but not limited to the following: 
 pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase equity, prepay subordinated debt and make certain loans or investments; incur, assume or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred stock; incur liens on assets; merge or consolidate with another person or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person; transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets including capital stock of subsidiaries; enter into transactions with affiliates; and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of our non-guarantor restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us. 
 Although financial and other covenants limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and affect our liquidity through minimum cash reserve requirements, we believe that these covenants currently provide us with sufficient flexibility to successfully operate our business and obtain the financing necessary to achieve that purpose. We are also subject to liquidity and net worth requirements established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA for Agency seller/servicers and Ginnie Mae for single-family issuers. FHFA and Ginnie Mae have established 

 73 

Table of Contents 
 minimum liquidity and net worth requirements for their approved non-depository single-family sellers/servicers in the case of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae for its approved single-family issuers. Ginnie Mae has issued risk-based capital requirements that will become effective December 31, 2024. We believe that we are in compliance with the Agency s pending requirements as of September 30, 2024. We have a common stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase common shares of up to 2 billion. Share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock. From inception through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 1.8 billion of common shares under our stock repurchase program. We continue to explore a variety of means of financing our business, including debt financing through bank warehouse lines of credit, bank loans, repurchase agreements, securitization transactions and corporate debt. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or whether such efforts will be successful. Debt Obligations As described further above in Liquidity and Capital Resources, we currently finance certain of our assets through short-term borrowings with major financial institutions in the form of sales of assets under agreements to repurchase and mortgage loan participation purchase and sale agreements. We access the capital market for long-term debt through the issuance of secured term notes, term loans and Unsecured Notes. The issuer under our secured term note facilities is PLS or a wholly-owned issuer trust guaranteed by PNMAC. In addition, PFSI has issued Unsecured Notes guaranteed by certain of its restricted wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. PLS is required to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in certain financing agreements, as described further above in Liquidity and Capital Resources . As of September 30, 2024, we believe PLS was in compliance in all material respects with these covenants. Many of our debt financing agreements contain a condition precedent to obtaining additional funding that requires PLS to maintain positive net income for at least one of the previous two consecutive quarters, or other similar measures. PLS is compliant with all such conditions. The financing agreements also contain margin call provisions that, upon notice from the applicable lender, require us to transfer cash or, in some instances, additional assets in an amount sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit. Upon notice from the applicable lender, we will generally be required to satisfy the margin call on the day of such notice or within one business day thereafter, depending on the timing of the notice. In addition, the financing agreements contain events of default (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods), including payment defaults, breaches of covenants and/or certain representations and warranties, cross-defaults, guarantor defaults, servicer termination events and defaults, material adverse changes, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and other events of default customary for these types of transactions. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for these types of transactions and include the acceleration of the principal amount outstanding under the agreements and the liquidation by our lenders of the mortgage loans or other collateral then subject to the agreements.

Certain of these estimates significantly influence the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies primarily relate to our fair value estimates. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies, which utilize relevant critical accounting estimates. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, real estate values and other market-based risks. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are fair value risk, interest rate risk and prepayment risk. 

 76 

Table of Contents 
 Fair Value Risk Our IRLCs, mortgage loans held for sale, principal-only stripped MBS, MSRs and MSLs are reported at their fair values. The fair value of these assets fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates. The fair value risk we face is primarily attributable to interest rate risk and prepayment risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. Changes in interest rates affect both the fair value of, and interest income we earn from, our mortgage-related investments and our derivative financial instruments. This effect is most pronounced with fixed-rate mortgage assets. In general, rising interest rates negatively affect the fair value of our IRLCs and inventory of mortgage loans held for sale and positively affect the fair value of our MSRs. Changes in interest rates significantly influence the prepayment speeds of the loans underlying our investments in MSRs, which can have a significant effect on their fair values. Changes in interest rate are most prominently reflected in the prepayment speeds of the loans underlying our investments in MSRs and the discount rate used in their valuation. Our operating results will depend, in part, on differences between the income from our investments and our financing costs. Presently much of our debt financing is based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over the relevant index, as determined by the particular financing arrangement. Prepayment Risk To the extent that the actual prepayment rate on the mortgage loans underlying our MSRs differs from what we projected when we initially recognized these assets and liabilities when we measure fair value as of the end of each reporting period, the carrying value of these assets and liabilities will be affected. In general, a decrease in the principal balances of the mortgage loans underlying our MSRs or an increase in prepayment expectations will decrease our estimates of the fair value of the MSRs, thereby reducing net servicing income, partially offset by the beneficial effect on net servicing income of a corresponding reduction in the fair value of our MSLs and an increase in the fair value of our principal-only stripped MBS. Risk Management Activities We engage in risk management activities primarily in an effort to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our assets. To manage this price risk, we use derivative financial instruments acquired with the intention of moderating the risk that changes in market interest rates will result in unfavorable changes in the fair value of our assets, primarily prepayment exposure on our MSR investments as well as IRLCs and our inventory of loans held for sale. Our objective is to minimize our hedging expense and maximize our loss coverage based on a given hedge expense target. We do not use derivative financial instruments other than IRLCs for purposes other than in support of our risk management activities. Our strategies are reviewed daily within a disciplined risk management framework. We use a variety of interest rate and spread shifts and scenarios and define target limits for market value and liquidity loss in those scenarios. With respect to our IRLCs and inventory of loans held for sale, we use MBS forward sale contracts to lock in the price at which we will sell the mortgage loans or resulting MBS, and further use MBS put options to mitigate the risk of our IRLCs not closing at the rate we expect. With respect to our MSRs, we seek to mitigate mortgage-based loss exposure utilizing MBS forward purchase and sale contracts and principal-only stripped MBS, address exposures to smaller interest rate shifts with Treasury and interest rate swap futures, and use options and swaptions to achieve target coverage levels for larger interest rate shocks.

 Fair Value Sensitivities The following sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time; only contemplate the movements in the indicated variables; do not incorporate changes to other variables; are subject to the accuracy of various models and inputs used; and do not incorporate other factors that would affect our overall financial performance in such scenarios, including operational adjustments made by management to account for changing circumstances. For these reasons, the following estimates should not be viewed as earnings forecasts.

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. However, no matter how well a control system is designed and operated, it can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Our management has conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report as required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. The amount, if any, of ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, but despite the inherent uncertainties of litigation, management believes that the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings and exposure will not have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies, to the financial statements contained in this report for a discussion of legal and regulatory proceedings that are incorporated by reference into this Item 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Item 1A.
