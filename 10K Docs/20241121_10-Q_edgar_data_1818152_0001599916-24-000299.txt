and as
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

United States 

The Company, which acts as a holding company on a
non-consolidated basis, does not plan to engage any business activities and current or future loss will be fully allowed. For the periods
ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Company as a holding company registered in the state of Delaware, has incurred net
loss and, therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry forward has been fully reserved. 

The Company has not recognized an income tax benefit
for its operating losses generated based on uncertainties concerning its ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The tax
benefit for the period presented is offset by a valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets arising from the net operating
losses, the realization of which could not be considered more likely than not. In future periods, tax benefits and related deferred tax
assets will be recognized when management considers realization of such amounts to be more likely than not. Due to the change in ownership
provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual
limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in future years. 

. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had
imputed interest of . 

from OFF Line Co., Ltd., a Company controlled by Koichi Ishizuka, CEO. The total due as of September 30, 2024 was 
and is unsecured, due on demand and non-interest bearing. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed from OFF Line Co., Ltd., a Company controlled by Koichi Ishizuka, CEO.
The total due as of December 31, 2023 was and is unsecured, due on demand and non-interest bearing. 

The
Company utilizes home office space and equipment of our management at no cost. Management estimates such amounts to be immaterial.

ITEM 2 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain statements, other than purely historical information,
including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions
upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 

These forward-looking statements generally are identified
by the words believes, project, expects, anticipates, estimates, 
 intends, strategy, plan, may, will, would, will
be, will continue, will likely result, and similar expressions. 

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations
and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could
have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes
in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting
principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should
not be placed on such statements. 

Company Overview 

Corporate History 

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Delaware on November 22, 2019. 

On November 22, 2019, Mr. Koichi Ishizuka was appointed
as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 

On November 22, 2019, the Company issued 20,000,000
shares of restricted Common Stock to Koichi Ishizuka for services rendered to the Company. 

On December 30, 2019, the Company entered into and
consummated a Share Contribution Agreement (the Share Contribution Agreement with Koichi Ishizuka. Pursuant to this agreement
Mr. Ishizuka gifted to the Company, at no cost, 100 shares of common stock of OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation OFF
Line Japan ), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares. Following the execution of this agreement OFF Line Japan
Co., Ltd. became our wholly owned subsidiary. 

On January 1, 2020, OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd entered
into an agreement with Ueda Tsusho Ltd to administer AirTalk , and to provide further development and maintenance of AirTalk 
and the Company s other various software and hardware it may have, such as the Company s AI system, all to be further developed
on an ongoing need be basis. OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd shall compensate Ueda Tsusho Ltd in the amount of JPY 40,000 (approximately 380)
per day; in this case a day will be defined as a calendar day during which services have been rendered. The total amount
of days will be totaled and accordingly invoiced by Ueda Tsusho Ltd. to the Company at the end of the month, and the Company will be responsible
for remitting full payment the following month. Any additional services not covered by the agreement shall receive compensation determined
on a case by case basis. The term of the agreement shall be from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020. 

On June 1, 2020, OFF Line Japan Co., Ltd entered into
an agreement with Scuderia-A Co. Ltd Scuderia-A to provide system development and maintenance for the Minamori Service
KID. This agreement was mutually agreed upon by all parties to be terminated on September 1, 2020. No monies were paid by the Company
to Scuderia-A Co. Ltd. as Scuderia-A Co. did not fulfill their end of the agreement. No services were ultimately provided and as a result
no monies were exchanged. 

On June 16, 2021, the Company s Board of Directors
approved to change the name of the Company from ZENTRUM HOLDINGS, INC.. to Zentrum Holdings, Inc. 

At this time, we operate exclusively through our wholly
owned subsidiary, OFF Line Japan and share the same business plan as that of our wholly owned subsidiary. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At present, we have not generated enough revenue resulting
in available cash to cover operating expenses for any substantive period of time. As of September 30, 2024, our available cash balance
was approximately 1,241. We believe that this sum of cash will not provide us enough means to operate for any substantive period of time. 

We have been utilizing, and may continue to utilize,
funds from Koichi Ishizuka, our sole officer and director, and/or OFF Line Co., Ltd., a related party entity that Koichi Ishizuka also
controls and serves as the sole officer and director of. 

On June 5, 2018 Koichi Ishizuka and OFF Line Japan
Co., Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an agreement whereas Koichi Ishizuka agreed to lend up to 46,000 to OFF Line Japan
Co., Ltd. 

On November 22, 2019, OFF Line Co., Ltd. and OFF Line
International, Inc., entered into an agreement whereas OFF Line Co., Ltd. agreed to lend up to 460,000 to the Company, OFF Line International,
Inc. 

If any of the above parties who have agreed to lend
us funds do not have funding available to lend us, or if we do not have available cash on hand to cover our operating expenses, we may
be forced to find alternative methods of financing. It is possible that in such case our business operations could be adversely affected
and we may be forced to cease operations entirely. 

Loans 

For the six months ended
September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 117,041 from Koichi Ishizuka, CEO, and OFF Line Co., Ltd.,
a Company controlled by Koichi Ishizuka. The total due as of September 30, 2024 was 855,329 and
is unsecured, due on demand and non-interest bearing. 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed 209,031 from
OFF Line Co., Ltd., a Company controlled by Koichi Ishizuka, CEO. The total due as of December 31, 2023 was 735,769 
and is unsecured, due on demand and non-interest bearing. 

Revenues 

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, were both 196. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was no revenue. 

Net Loss 

We
recorded a net loss of 56,103 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 .We
recorded a net loss of 163,485 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit
of 1,155,239. 

We recorded a net loss of 84,992 for the three months ended September
30, 2023.We recorded a net loss of 207,703 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we had an accumulated
deficit of 944,712. 

Cash flow 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had negative cash flows
from operations in the amount of 119,195 and we had cash flows from financing activities in the amount of 117,041, which were a result
of proceeds from due to a related party. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had negative cash flows from operations in the amount of 172,400 and we had cash flows from
financing activities in the amount of 173,924 ,
which were a result of proceeds from due to a related party. 

Working capital 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had working deficit
of 861,487 and 740,098, respectively. 

Going Concern 

The Company s financial statements are prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets
and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

The Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year following the issuance of these financial statements.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically operating loss, working capital deficiency, and other adverse key
financial ratios. 

The Company has established a source of revenue to
cover its operating costs but has depended on one customer and one product. If the relationship with current customer is terminated, we
will struggle to continue with our current business plan. In that case, we may be forced to alter, cease, or suspend our business operations
entirely in a worst case scenario. 

The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

ITEM 4 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer (who is acting as our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to
allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As of September 30,
2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our chief executive officer of the effectiveness of the design and the operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. The officers concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
the end of the period covered by this report due to material weaknesses identified below. 

The matters involving internal controls and procedures
that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: domination
of management by a single individual without adequate compensating controls, lack of a majority of outside directors on board of directors,
resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; inadequate segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives, and lack of an audit committee. These material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive
Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer in connection with the above evaluation. 

Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent
limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance, interpretation of existing
and/or changing rules and principles, segregation of management duties, scale of organization, and personnel factors. Internal control
over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns
resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management
override. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a
timely basis, however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into
the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting that have occurred for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
