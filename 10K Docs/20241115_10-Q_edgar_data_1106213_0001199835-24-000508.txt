Part
I: Financial Information 

Statements
in this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to our future
activities or other future events or conditions. These statements are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about
our business based, in part, on assumptions made by our management. These assumptions are not guarantees of future performance and involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from
what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including those risks discussed in this Form
10-Q Quarterly Report, under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
and in other documents which we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

In
addition, such statements could be affected by risks and uncertainties related to our financial condition, factors that affect our industry,
market and customer acceptance, changes in technology, fluctuations in our quarterly results, our ability to continue and manage our
growth, liquidity and other capital resource issues, compliance with government regulations and permits, agreements with third parties
to conduct operations, competition, fulfillment of contractual obligations by other parties and general economic conditions. Any forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement
to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report, except as required by Federal Securities law.

SEAFARER
 EXPLORATION CORP. 
 
 NOTES
 TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 (Unaudited) 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Seafarer Exploration Corp. Seafarer or the Company are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary
to fairly state the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the dates and periods presented.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial information. 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements and footnotes included in the Company s Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the Commission on March 26, 2024. The results of operations for the nine month period ended September
30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future
period. 

NOTE
1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Seafarer
Exploration Corp. Seafarer or the Company ), was incorporated on May 28, 2003 in the State of Delaware. 

The
principal business of the Company is to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive exploration, documentation, recovery, and conservation
of historic shipwrecks with the objective of exploring and discovering Colonial-era shipwrecks for future generations to be able to appreciate
and understand. 

In
March of 2014, Seafarer entered into a partnership with Marine Archaeology Partners, LLC MAP ), with the formation of Seafarer s
Quest, LLC SQ for the purpose of exploring a shipwreck site off of Melbourne Beach, Florida. Under the partnership with
MAP, Seafarer is the designated manager of SQ. 

The
Company s wholly owned subsidiary Blockchain LogisTech, LLC Blockchain ), was formed on April 4, 2018 and began operations
in 2019. The Company is evaluating Blockchain s business opportunities and does not believe that Blockchain will generate any revenues
for the foreseeable future. 

The
Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Exploration Studios, LLC, in May 2018 in order to explore media strategies and opportunities.
Exploration Studios, LLC has not yet commenced operations. 

Florida
Division of Historical Resources Agreements/Permits 

The
Company successfully renewed its permits for both Areas 1 and 2 for the Melbourne Beach site. The Area 1 permit was renewed on March
1, 2019 for a period of three years. The Area 2 permit was renewed on January 14, 2019 for a period of three years. Per Florida Statutes,
Seafarer made a timely request for renewal of the 2019 permit for Area 2 on July 29, 2022. In January of 2022, Seafarer received notification
from the Florida Division of Historical Resources FDHR that its permit for Area 2, which was set to expire on January
19, 2022, has been continued indefinitely while the renewal request was being processed. The existing permits will continue until the
renewal is finalized or rejected. Per Florida Statutes, Seafarer made a timely request for renewal of the 2019 permit for Area 1 on July
29, 2021. On March 2, 2022, Seafarer received notification that the permit would continue indefinitely with the same terms as Area 2. 

Federal
Admiralty Judgment 

Seafarer
was granted, through the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a final judgment for its federal admiralty
claim on the Juno Beach shipwreck site. The Company received an updated permit from the United State Army Corp of Engineers USACE ). 

Blockchain
Software Services Referral Agreements 

Management
is reviewing potential alternate plans for Blockchain and believes that it is highly unlikely that Blockchain will generate any revenues
for the foreseeable future, if ever. 

NOTE
2 GOING CONCERN 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be
able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has
incurred net losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of 31,409,200 as of September 30, 2024. During the nine month period
ended September 30, 2024, the Company s net loss was 3,061,742 and at September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit
of 2,486,269. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on its historical
rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than three months from November 14, 2024. Management s
plans include raising capital through the issuance of common stock and debt to fund operations and, eventually, the generation of revenue
through its business. The Company does not expect to generate any significant revenues for the foreseeable future. The Company is in
immediate need of further working capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination
thereof. 

9 

Failure
to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The Company s
ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of the common stock is unknown. Additionally, even if the Company does
raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue
will be sufficient to enable it to develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern; however, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern. 

Convertible
Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are currently
in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on the assets
held as collateral for the obligations arising under the secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the assets held
as collateral, then the Company may be forced to significantly scale back or cease its operations which would more than likely result
in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company is in default regarding
several loans held by various lenders makes investing in the Company or providing any loans to the Company extremely risky with a very
high potential for a complete loss of capital. 

The
convertible notes that have been issued by the Company are convertible at the lender s option. These convertible notes represent
significant potential dilution to the Company s current shareholders as the convertible price of these notes is generally lower
than the current market price of the Company s shares. As such when these notes are converted into equity there is typically a
highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and very high probability that such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading
price of the Company s common stock. Furthermore, management intends to have discussions with several of the promissory note holders
who do not currently have convertible notes regarding converting their notes into equity. Any such amended agreements to convert promissory
notes into equity would more than likely have a highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and there is a very high probability that
such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading price of the Company s common stock. 

See
Note 5 Convertible notes payable in default, Convertible notes payable related parties, in default, Notes payable
 in default, Notes payable related parties, in default, for further information regarding the Company s convertible
notes payable and notes payable that are currently in default due to non payment of principal and interest. 

Current
Economic Conditions 

The
Company and certain of its advisors are closely monitoring current domestic economic conditions. The Federal Reserve (the Fed recently discussed that while inflation growth has moderated in 2024, prices remain high for many goods and services. The Company s
vessels use large amounts of fuel when in operation and higher prices gasoline have caused an increase in the Company s operating
expenses. The high cost of fuel may hamper the Company s ability to conduct operations. Furthermore, even though inflation has
moderated in 2024 and has retreated from recent high, if inflation were to reignite then the Company may see increased expenses that
would severely hamper the Company s ability to continue its operations which would likely lead to a complete loss of all capital
invested in and/or loaned to the Company. 

NOTE
3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

This
summary of significant accounting policies of Seafarer Exploration Corp. is presented to assist in understanding the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are representations
of the Company s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to GAAP
and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Principles
of Consolidation 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and Blockchain which is a wholly
owned subsidiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications 

Certain
reclassifications were made to the prior consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. There
was no change to the previously reported net loss. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments and short-term
debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally
of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to 250,000.
At September 30, 2024, the Company had deposits that were 156,961 in excess of the FDIC insured limit. 

10 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Expenditures
for research and development are expensed as incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of 399,292 and 193,621
for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 110,309 and 87,687 for the three month periods ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in operating expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 and all
the related amendments. 

The
core principle of ASC 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASC
606 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required
within the revenue recognition process than required under GAAP, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating
the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance
obligation. 

The
Company recognizes revenue from the referrals that Blockchain has made to providers of software services when payment for a referral
is received from the provider of software services. Blockchain, at its sole discretion and with no specific sales quotas or targets,
provides referrals of potential end users to the software service providers and is paid a referral fee only after the software services
providers receive payment from the end user. 

The
Company also has a separate sales referral agreement, with no sales quotas or specific goals or targets, with a limited liability company
that provides product/system engineering and development services. The Company s performance obligation is met when the payment
from the customer is received by the provider of the development services, which is at a point in time. The Company receives referral
fees when payment is received from the provider of the product/system development services which is when the Company recognizes revenue
under the agreement. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when cash is received or when it has met its obligations per the terms of a contract or agreement for services.
Payments received for services are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when the services have been provided. 

During
2021 the Company entered into an agreement to provide scanning services using its SeaSearcher technology to a corporation involved in
searching for historic shipwreck material. Under the terms of the agreement the Company received an upfront payment of 140,000 which
has been included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as
deferred revenue as the services have not yet been provided. 

Earnings
Per Share 

The
Company has adopted the FASB ASC 260-10, Earnings per Share , which provides for the calculation of basic and diluted 
earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common
stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution
of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. 

The
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were excluded from the dilutive
loss per share calculation as they would be antidilutive due to the net loss. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were approximately
606,961,668 and 804,143,176 shares of common stock underlying the outstanding convertible notes payable and warrants, respectively. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

The
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, convertible notes payable and
payables, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Property,
Plant and Equipment 

Property,
plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the respective assets. 

Depreciation
expense was 16,395 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and 5,465 for the three month periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, which is included in operating expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

11 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

In
accordance with ASC 360-10, Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Asset s, the Company, on a regular basis, reviews the carrying
amount of long-lived assets for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, that suggest impairment. The
Company determines if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is impaired based on anticipated undiscounted cash flows, before interest,
from the use of the asset. In the event of impairment, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds
the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on appraised value of the assets or the anticipated cash flows from the use
of the asset, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. There were no impairment charges recorded during the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
process of preparing unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and
assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Significant estimates for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include useful life of property, plant and equipment, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets
and the fair value of non cash equity transactions. 

Segment
Information 

During
2019, Seafarer s wholly owned subsidiary, Blockchain, began operations, generated revenue and incurred expenses. The business of
Blockchain has no relation to the Company s shipwreck exploration and recovery operations other than common ownership. As such,
the Company concluded that the operations of Blockchain and Seafarer Exploration were separate reportable segments as of the nine month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (see Note 9 Segment Information). 

Convertible
Debentures 

The
Company adheres to the guidance in Accounting Standards Updated ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity . ASU 2020-06 simplifies an issuer s accounting for convertible instruments
and its application of the derivatives scope exception for contracts in its own equity. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 removes the requirements
for accounting for beneficial conversion features. 

Fair
Value Measurements and Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The
Company adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements . ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes methods
for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date. 

Level
2: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated
by observable market data. 

Level
3: Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information. 

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including all current liabilities are carried at historical cost basis, which
approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 

The
inputs to the valuation methodology of stock options and warrants were under level 3 fair value measurements. 

ASC
subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments ASC 825-10 requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. All other significant financial assets,
financial liabilities and equity instruments of the Company are either recognized or disclosed in the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements together with other information relevant for making a reasonable assessment of future cash flows, interest rate
risk and credit risk. Where practicable the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been determined and disclosed;
otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed. 

The
Company follows ASC subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 and ASC 825-10, which
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. 

Stock
Based Compensation 

The
Company applies the fair value method of FASB ASC 718, Share Based Payment , in accounting for its stock-based compensation. The
standard states that compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the
service period. The Company values stock-based compensation at the market price for the Company s common stock and other pertinent
factors at the grant date. 

Fully
vested and non-forfeitable shares issued prior to the services being performed are classified as prepaid expenses. 

12 

Leases 

The
Company accounts for leases under ASU 2016-02. At the inception of a contract the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains,
a lease. The Company s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether
the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether
it has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company will allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component
based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. 

Operating
lease right of use ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities
are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases
do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date
in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term and is presented in operating expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

Finance
leases are recorded as a finance lease liability and property, plant and equipment asset, based on the present value of lease payments.
The asset is depreciated, and the liability is amortized with interest expense incurred over the life of the lease. 

As
permitted under the new guidance, the Company has made an accounting policy election not to apply the recognition provisions of the guidance
to short term leases (leases with a lease term of twelve months or less that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset
that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise); instead, the Company will recognize the lease payments for short term leases on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Income
Taxes 

Income
taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using
the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available
evidence, are not expected to be realized. 

Subsequent
Events 

It
is the Company s policy to evaluate all events that occur after the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet date through
the date when the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued to determine if they must be reported. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

All
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including ASU 2023-07 and 2023-09, did not or are not believed by management
to have a material impact on the Company s present or future unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

13 

NOTE
4 RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES 

Operating
Leases 

Operating
lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement
date. The interest rate used to determine the present value is the incremental borrowing rate, estimated to be 10 , as the interest rate
implicit in most of the Company s leases are not readily determinable. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. 

The
Company leases 823 square feet of office space located at 14497 North Dale Mabry Highway, Suite 209-N, Tampa, Florida 33618. The Company
entered into an amended lease agreement commencing on July 1, 2020 through July 31, 2023 with base month rents of 1,475 from July
1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, 1,519 from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, 1,564 from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 and 1,611 from
July 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023. The Company entered into an amended lease agreement commencing on August 1, 2023 through July 31, 2025
with base month rents of 1,612 from August 1, 2023 to June 31, 2024 and 1,676 from August 1, 2024 to July 31, 2025. Under
the terms of the lease there may be additional fees charged above the base monthly rental fee. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded 10,308 and 9,202 as operating lease expense, respectively, which is included in rent expense
on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company
recorded 5,154 and 4,601 as operating lease expense, respectively, which is included in rent expense on the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations. 

On

Shareholder
Loan 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had the following loans outstanding to its CEO in the total amount of 5,000 as
follows: 

- 
 A
 loan with no due date with a 1,500 remaining balance and an interest rate of 2 and a conversion rate of 0.0005; and 

- 
 A
 loan due on September 9, 2022 with a remaining balance of 3,500, and an interest rate of 1 . 

Collateralized
Promissory Notes 

Two
convertible notes outstanding with related parties, dated January 9, 2009 and January 18, 2012 are collateralized by Company assets. 

Convertible
Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are currently
in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on the assets
held as collateral for the obligations arising under the secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the assets held
as collateral, then the Company may be forced to significantly scale back or cease its operations, which would more than likely result
in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company is in default of several
promissory notes held by various lenders makes investing in the Company or providing any loans to the Company extremely risky with a
very high potential for a complete loss of capital. The Company s convertible notes payable and notes payable in default represent
a very significant risk to the viability of the Company.

Overview 

General 

The
Company s principal business plan is to develop the infrastructure and technology to engage in the rescue archaeology and archaeologically-sensitive
exploration, recovery and conservation of historic shipwrecks and to eventually monetize the recovery of the shipwrecks without selling
the treasure by creating revenue through media and technology alternatives for different industry sectors. Once artifacts have been properly
conserved, they may be made available for scientific research and allowed to be displayed for the public. The Company s secondary
business is to attempt to develop revenue streams to support its historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations. Such revenue
streams will complement the technology developed by Seafarer or potentially be media related although no such revenue has materialized. 

The
Company has received from the Florida Department of State a notice of lack of authority to permit or deny recovery activities on the
unidentified shipwreck on Juno Beach. The Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research (the Bureau ), Division of Historical
Resources, Florida Department of State stated to Seafarer The shipwreck is non-permittable pursuant to Rule 1A-31.0045(2), F.A.C. The
Bureau cited an order dated November 14, 2017 where the United States District Court entered a Final Order of Court
Default and Final Judgement Granting Award for Admiralty in Rem. The District Court s order ruled Seafarer is hereby the
true, sole, and exclusive owner of the Defendant Shipwrecked Vessel and having exclusive right to conduct recovery operation on the Defendant
Shipwrecked Vessel and any items recovered therefrom. Additional permitting was received from the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 

In
order to potentially find more efficient methods to explore and document historical shipwrecks, the Company has investigated various
technologies and non-scientific methodologies. To the present date, none of these technologies have been proven to work with the
exception of the SeaSearcher, which has been developed to scan historic shipwreck sites for both ferrous and nonferrous artifacts.
Although the Company believes that the SeaSearcher has shown some efficacy, the technology has been hampered by a number of
technical issues that have limited its use in the field and that have caused significant down time. The ongoing developmental work
and improvements to the SeaSearcher have been expensive and Management anticipates that significant expenses for these development
costs will continue to be incurred for the foreseeable future. Advances in algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) will continue
indefinitely while the present model can be currently used in the field with some limitations due to periodic technical issues. The
Company will continue to experiment with unproven technologies and will actively work with third parties, consultants and scientists
to develop its own proprietary technology which has and will result in considerable expenses. 

The
Company continues to review revenue producing opportunities including joint ventures and partnerships with other companies and potentially
governmental agencies. 

There
is a possibility that the Company will be forced to cease its operations if it is not successful in eventually locating and recovering
valuable artifacts and treasure or can t build a revenue stream to offset its expenses. If the Company were to cease its operations,
and not find or engage another business entity, then it is likely that there would be complete loss of all capital invested in or borrowed
by the Company. As such, an investment in Seafarer is highly speculative and very risky. 

25 

This
type of business venture is highly speculative in nature and carries an excessive amount of risk. An investment in the Company s
securities is very risky and should only be considered by those investors or lenders who do not require liquidity and who can afford
to suffer a complete and total loss of their investment. 

There
is currently a limited trading market for the Company s securities. It is impossible for the Company to assure that when and if
an active-trading market in its shares will be established, or whether any such market will be sustained or sufficiently liquid to enable
holders of shares of the Company s common stock to liquidate their investment in our company. 

The
sale of restricted securities by current shareholders, including shares issued to consultants, independent contractors, Board members,
as well as shares issued to settle convertible promissory notes or to settle other loans and debt, are highly dilutive and may cause
a significant decline in the market price of the Company s securities. Furthermore, in recent years regulatory agencies have made
it very difficult for broker dealers to accept stock certificates from issuers of low priced stocks and the Company believes that it
may become even more challenging to deposit stock certificates and this trend may continue for the foreseeable future. 

Moreover,
in the past few years several major brokerage firms have indicated that they will not allow their clients to deposit stock certificates
of low priced stocks. Some securities clearing firms who used to clear low priced securities for multiple brokerage firms have shut down
or been acquired, resulting in fewer brokerage firms that are willing or able to accept lower priced securities for deposit. Unless an
investor has a large and well-established relationship with a brokerage firm, it may be extremely difficult and potentially expensive
to deposit lower priced securities. An investor should consider consulting with professional financial advisers before making an investment
in our securities. The Company is a current and fully reporting company. 

Plan
of Operation 

The
Company has taken the following steps to implement its business plan: 

To
date, the Company has devoted its time towards establishing its business to develop the infrastructure capable of researching, exploring,
recovering and conserving historic shipwrecks. The Company has performed some research, exploration and recovery activities. 

Spent
considerable time and capital researching potential shipwrecks, including obtaining information from foreign archives. 

The
Company has worked in combination with its technology development partner, Wild Manta Labs, to build a research and conservation lab
with full x-ray equipment and detailed metal identification analysis. 

The
Company has generated very limited revenues to date. Management does not believe that the Company will generate any significant revenues
for the foreseeable future. 

The
Company continues to review revenue producing opportunities including joint ventures with other companies. The Company is actively looking
to work with revenue producing companies. These opportunities have been slow to develop, but the Company will continue to pursue those
endeavors that it believes have the potential to increase the value of the Company s shares. 

The
Company has investigated various types of equipment and technology to expedite the process of finding artifacts other than iron or ferrous
metals. Most have been of no help, but the Company continues to explore new technologies. The Company has developed its own proprietary
technology, the SeaSearcher, and will attempt to continue to develop additional proprietary technologies or work with third parties to
develop technologies to aid in its exploration and recovery operations. Development of technologies will require additional time and
financing. The cost of developing the new technology has, to date, been very expensive for a small company. 

The
Company has investigated media opportunities to develop content centered on its specific historic shipwreck exploration and recovery
activities as well as the historic shipwreck and related historical period genre in general and will continue to evaluate various media
strategies. 

Other
Information 

There
are very strict international, federal and state laws that govern the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. While the Company
has been able to obtain some permits, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure future permits or enter into agreements
with government agencies in order to explore and salvage historic shipwrecks. Seafarer believes they are the only company to be issued
a full recovery permit by FBAR since 1986, other than one entity with an Admiralty Claim. This demonstrates the difficulty of obtaining
a recovery permit from FBAR. There is a risk that government entities may enact legislation that is so strict that any recovery of artifacts
and cargo from historic shipwrecks will be nearly impossible. Additionally, permits and agreements with governmental agencies to conduct
historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations are expensive, in terms of both direct costs and ongoing compliance costs. It
is also possible that the Company will not be successful in obtaining title or permission to excavate certain wrecks, even if the law
allows it. It is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued,
may not be legal or honored by the entities that issued them. For the above reasons, the Company has extended its research into shipwrecks
outside of State waters.

It
is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued, may not be legal
or honored by the entities that issued them. Governmental agencies may require various types of permits to explore shipwreck sites, and
the permitting process is often lengthy and complex. Obtaining permits and entering into agreements with governmental and quasi-governmental
agencies to conduct historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations is generally a very complex, time consuming, and expensive
process. Furthermore, the process of entering into agreements and/or obtaining permits may be subject to lengthy delays, possibly in
excess of a year. Some governmental agencies may refuse to issue permits to the Company for recovery of artifacts or intentionally delay
the permitting process, or go beyond their authority and request halting of ground disturbance. 

The
reasons for a lengthy permitting process are myriad and may be due to a number of potential factors including but not limited to requests
by permitting agencies for additional information, submitted applications that need to be revised or updated, newly discovered information
that needs to be added to an application or agreement, changes to either the agreement or permit terms or revisions to other information
contained in the permit, excessive administrative time lags at permitting agencies, work halts based on biased predispositions with no
authority given by rule 1A-31, etc. Existing permits and agreements may be put on hold or suspended without notice for lengthy periods
of time due to administrative issues and disagreements over the terms and conditions. The length of time it takes to obtain permits,
enter into agreements, or rectify any conditions that are causing a permit to be suspended or on hold may cause the Company to expend
significant resources while gearing up to do work with little or no visibility as to timing. 

The
Company regularly reviews opportunities to perform exploration and recovery operations at purported historic shipwreck sites. The Company
currently does have some specific plans to perform exploration and recovery operations at other shipwreck sites in the future, however
these plans are subject to change based on a number of factors. The Company is actively reviewing other potential historic shipwreck
sites, including sites located internationally, for possible exploration and recovery. Should the Company decide that it will pursue
exploration and recovery activities at other potential shipwreck sites, it may be necessary to obtain various permits as well as environmental
permits. 

The
Company continually monitors media rights for potential revenue opportunities. The Company has had discussions with media entities to
further understand the potential advantages offered. Management believes various forms of media can represent a potential future revenue
opportunity for the Company, if the right circumstances arise. 

This
type of business venture is extremely speculative in nature and carries a tremendous amount of risk. An investment in the Company s
securities is highly speculative and very risky and should only be considered by those investors or lenders who do not require near-term
liquidity and who can afford to suffer a complete and total loss of their investment. 

Results
of Operations 

Since
inception, we have generated only minimal revenue from operations and do not expect to report any significant revenue from operations
for the foreseeable future. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability
and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

The
Company expects to continue to incur significant operating losses and to generate negative cash flow from operating activities, while
building out its infrastructure in order to explore and salvage historic shipwreck sites and establishing itself in the marketplace.
Based on our historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than three months from November
14, 2024. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital deficits of 2,459,269 and 1,808,783, respectively. The Company s
working capital deficit, along with its lack of meaningful cash flows from operations with which to service the debt, indicates that
there is substantial risk to the continued viability of the Company. The Company is in immediate need of further working capital and
is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. 

Since
inception, the Company has funded its operations through common stock issuances and loans in order to meet its strategic objectives;
however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain further funds to continue with its efforts to establish a
new business. There is a very significant risk that the Company will be unable to obtain financing to fund its operations and as such
the Company may be forced to cease operations at any time which would likely result in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested
in and/or borrowed by the Company to date. 

The
Company s ability to eliminate operating losses and to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future will depend upon
a variety of factors, many of which it is unable to control. If the Company is unable to implement its business plan successfully, it
may not be able to eliminate operating losses, generate positive cash flow or achieve or sustain profitability, which may have a material
adverse effect on the Company s business, operations, and financial results, as well as its ability to make payments on its debt
obligations, and the Company may be forced to cease operations. 

If
the Company is unable to secure additional financing, our business may fail and our stock price will likely be materially adversely affected.
The Company s lack of operating cash flow and reliance on the sale of its common stock and loans to fund operations is extremely
risky. If the Company is unable to continue to raise capital or obtain loans or other financing on terms that are acceptable to the Company,
or at all, then it is highly likely that the Company will be forced to cease operations. If the Company ceases its operations, then it
is highly likely that all capital invested in and/or borrowed by the Company will be lost.

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses were 2,664,502 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 2,238,001 for the same period in 2023, an increase
of 17 . The overall increase in operating expenses in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in consulting and contracting expenses and
research and development expenses. Although the growth in the rate of inflation has moderated somewhat in 2024, the elevated price environment
has continued to pressure costs relating to many of the Company s expenses. Consulting and contractor expense was 1,424,204 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 1,291,709 for the same period in 2023, an increase of nearly 10 . Rising labor
costs have increased expenses associated with consulting and contracting expenses. The Company incurred vessel related expenses of 178,720
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 292,690 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of approximately 137 . The Company s vessels have not required as much repairs in 2023 which has led to lower vessel related expenses.
During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, professional fees were 136,487 as compared to 106,678 during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 28 . Professional fees fluctuate based on the use of professional service
providers, in particular in relation to various legal matters. Research and development expenses were 399,292 in 2024 versus 193,621
in 2023, an increase of approximately 102 . The increase in the Company s research and development expenses were related to the
ongoing development of its SeaSearcher autonomous underwater device and development of related technology including a handheld metal
discriminator. The Company believes that it will continue to expend significant resources to further develop the SeaSearcher and to begin
developing next generation versions of the technology. Research and development expenses are expected to fluctuate based on the adoption
of technological advances and upgrades into the existing SeaSearcher platform and the availability of financing. During the nine month
period ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 322,723 as compared to 258,009 during the nine month period
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 25 . Depreciation and amortization expense was 37,531 during the nine month period ended September
30, 2024 and 36,347 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Rent expense was 33,187 during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2024 versus 30,813 for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 8 . The Company incurred travel and entertainment
expenses of 132,350 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 73,034 during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2023, an approximate 81 increase. Entertainment and travel expenses may fluctuate due to inflationary increase in costs
and general corporate activity, including travel to and from the Juno Beach historic shipwreck location and lodging expenses for personnel. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

Other
income (expense) was (407,024) during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus (77,612) during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2023. The 506 increase in other expense in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in interest expenses and extinguishment
of debt. Interest expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was 218,770 versus 54,564 for the same period in 2023,
an increase of approximately 300 . Interest expense increased in 2024 due to the amortization of debt discounts and increase in convertible
notes payable and notes payable. Loss on extinguishment of debt was 196,774 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus
 23,049 during the same period in 2023, an increase of 754 . The increase in the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2024 was due to the
conversion of the principal balance and accrued interest on convertible notes payable. 

Net
Loss 

The
Company s net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3,061,742, and 2,360,023, respectively, a year-over-year
increase of approximately 30 .

Lack
of Liquidity 

A
major financial challenge and significant risk facing the Company is a lack of positive cash flow and liquidity. The Company continued
to operate with significant debt and a working capital deficit during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. This working capital
deficit indicates that the Company is unable to meet its short-term liabilities with its current assets. This working
capital deficit is extremely risky for the Company as it may be forced to cease its operations due to its inability to meet its current
obligations. If the Company is forced to cease its operations, then it is highly likely that all capital invested in and/or borrowed
by the Company will be lost. 

The
expenses associated with being a small publicly traded company attempting to develop the infrastructure to explore and salvage historic
shipwrecks recovery are extremely prohibitive, especially given that the Company does not currently generate any significant revenues
and does not expect to generate any significant revenues in the near future. There are ongoing expenses associated with operations that
are incurred whether the Company is conducting shipwreck recovery operations or not. Vessel maintenance, upkeep expenses and docking
fees are continuous and unavoidable regardless of the Company s operational status. Management anticipates that the vessels utilized
by the Company in its operations will need continuous and unavoidable repairs and maintenance, particularly if the Company ramps up its
operational footprint and is working on more than one site simultaneously as anticipated. These repairs and maintenance are expensive
and have a negative impact on the Company s cash position. 

In
addition to the operation expenses, a publicly traded company also incurs the significant recurring corporate expenses related to maintaining
publicly traded status, which include, but are not limited to accounting, legal, audit, executive, administrative, corporate communications,
rent, telephones, etc. The recurring expenses associated with being a publicly traded company are very burdensome for smaller public
companies such as Seafarer. This lack of liquidity creates a very risky situation for the Company in terms of its ability to continue
operating, which in turn makes owning shares of the Company s common stock extremely risky and highly speculative. The Company s
lack of liquidity may cause the Company to be forced to cease operations at any time which would likely result in a complete loss of
all capital invested in or borrowed by the Company to date. 

Due
to the fact that the Company does not generate any revenues and does not expect to generate revenues for the foreseeable future it must
rely on outside equity and debt funding. The combination of the ongoing operating expenses that must be met even during times when there
is little or no exploration or recovery activities taking place, and corporate expenses, creates a very risky situation for the Company
and its shareholders in terms of the need to access external financing to fund operations. This working capital shortfall and lack of
access to cash to fund corporate activities is extremely risky and may force the Company to cease its operations which would more than
likely result in a complete loss of all capital invested in or loaned to the Company to date. 

Lack
of Revenues and Cash Flow/Significant Losses from Operations 

The
exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks requires a multi-year, multi-stage process and it may be many years before any significant
revenue is generated from exploration and recovery activities, if ever. The Company does not believe that it will generate any significant
revenues in the near future. The Company believes that it may be several years before it is able to generate any cash flow from its operations,
if any are ever generated at all. Without revenues and cash flow the Company does not have reliable cash flow to pay its expenses. The
Company relies on outside financing in the form of equity and debt and it is possible that the Company may not be able to obtain outside
financing in the future. If the Company is not able to obtain financing it would more than likely be forced to cease operations and all
of the capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company would be lost. 

If
the Company is unable to secure additional financing, our business may fail or our operating results and our stock price may be materially
adversely affected. The raising of additional financing would in all likelihood result in dilution or reduction in the value of the Company s
securities. 

The
Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is highly likely
that all capital invested in the Company or borrowed by the Company will be lost. The report of our independent auditors for the years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, we have experienced
operating losses in every year since our inception resulting in an accumulated deficit. If the Company is not able to continue as a going
concern, it is highly likely that all capital invested in the Company or borrowed by the Company will be lost. 

The
Company has experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since inception. The Company s losses from operations were 2,654,718 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2,282,411 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The Company believes
that it will continue to generate losses from its operations for the foreseeable future and the Company may not be able to generate a
profit in the long-term, or ever. 

31 

Convertible
Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are currently
in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on the assets
held as collateral for the obligations arising under the secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the assets held
as collateral, then the Company may be forced to significantly scale back or cease its operations which would more than likely result
in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company is in default regarding
several loans held by various lenders makes investing in the Company or providing any loans to the Company extremely risky with a very
high potential for a complete loss of capital. 

The
convertible notes that have been issued by the Company are convertible at the lender s option. These convertible notes represent
significant potential dilution to the Company s current shareholders as the convertible price of these notes is generally lower
than the current market price of the Company s shares. As such when these notes are converted into equity there is typically a
highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and very high probability that such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading
price of the Company s common stock. Furthermore, management intends to have discussions or has already had discussions with several
of the promissory note holders who do not currently have convertible notes regarding converting their notes into equity. Any such amended
agreements to convert promissory notes into equity would more than likely have a highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and there
is a very high probability that such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading price of the Company s common stock.
Some of these note holders have already amended their notes and converted the notes into equity. Based on conversations with other note
holders, the Company believes that additional note holders will amend their notes to contain a convertibility clause and eventually convert
the notes into equity. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments which affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities (see Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies, contained
in the notes to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 contained in this filing). On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates based upon different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. 

Management
is aware that certain changes in accounting estimates employed in generating financial statements can have the effect of making the Company
look more or less profitable than it actually is. Management does not believe that the Company has made any such changes in accounting
estimates.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s
Responsibility for Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial
reporting. The Company s controls over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of the Company s Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is accumulated and
communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer/principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize and report financial information required to be included on
our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of
ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes
that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

32 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and based on the criteria for effective internal control described in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (as revised). Based on our evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize
and report financial information required to be included on our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to
the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result
of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are
materially correct. 

Management,
including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures, or
its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
the control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

The
Company has limited resources and as a result, a material weakness in financial reporting currently exists, because of our limited resources
and personnel, including those described below. 

The
Company has an insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal controls.
As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. 

We
have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions. 

We
do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an audit
committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it is Management s view that to have an audit committee, comprised of
independent board members, and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entity-level control over the Company s
financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditing standard 5) or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
has determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company s limited resources
and personnel. 

Remediation
Efforts to Address Deficiencies in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
a result of these findings, management, upon obtaining sufficient capital and operations, intends to take practical, cost-effective steps
in implementing internal controls, including the possible remedial measures set forth below. As of September 30, 2024 we did not have
sufficient capital and/or operations to implement any of the remedial measures described below: 

Assessing
the current duties of existing personnel and consultants, assigning additional duties to existing personnel and consultants, and, in
a cost effective manner, potentially hiring additional personnel to assist with the preparation of the Company s financial statements
to allow for proper segregation of duties, as well as additional resources for control documentation. 

Assessing
the duties of the existing officers of the Company and, in a cost effective manner, possibly promote or hire additional personnel to
diversify duties and responsibilities of such executive officers. 

Board
to review and make recommendations to shareholders concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, with particular focus on issues
of independence. The Board of Directors will consider nominating an audit committee and audit committee financial expert, which may or
may not consist of independent members. 

Interviewing
and potentially hiring outside consultants that are experts in designing internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO (as revised).

This
report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

The
Company has not made any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the six month period ended September 30, 2024.

II. Other Information 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

On
December 21, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County, Florida against John Grimm Grimm ),
for one count of Conversion. On February 8, 2023, the Company amended its Complaint to include Zachary Smith as co-plaintiff (the Company
and Smith are collectively the Plaintiffs against Grimm for one count of Conversion, one count of Rescission, one count
of Civil Theft, one count of Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and one count of Judicial Dissolution. The Plaintiff s jointly sought treble
damages, attorney s fees, the return of all Seafarer equipment and other equitable relief. In December 2023, the Parties agreed
to enter into negotiations towards a settlement. In February 2024, Defendant Grimm agreed to the following terms: i) Vessel Good
