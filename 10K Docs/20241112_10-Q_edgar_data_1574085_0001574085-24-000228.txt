 of the gross rooms revenue for the preceding calendar month for the remainder of the term. As of September 30, 2024, we are currently paying of gross revenues. 
 
 Management Fees Under hotel management agreements for our hotel properties existing at September 30, 2024, we pay a monthly hotel management fee equal to the greater of approximately per hotel (increased annually based on consumer price index adjustments) or of gross revenues, or in some cases, to of gross revenues, as well as annual incentive management fees, if applicable. These management agreements expire from November 2029 through December 2065, with renewal options. If we terminate a management agreement prior to its expiration, we may be liable for estimated management fees through the remaining term, liquidated damages or, in certain circumstances, we may substitute a new management agreement. 
 Income Taxes We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the federal jurisdiction and various states. Tax years 2019 through 2023 remain subject to potential examination by certain federal and state taxing authorities. 
 Litigation On December 20, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against of the Company s hotel management companies in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Contra Costa alleging violations of certain California employment laws, which class action affects hotels owned by subsidiaries of the Company. The court has entered an order granting class certification with respect to: (i) a statewide class of non-exempt employees of our manager who were allegedly deprived of rest breaks as a result of our manager s previous written policy requiring its employees to stay on premises during rest breaks; and (ii) a derivative class of non-exempt former employees of our manager who were not paid for allegedly missed breaks upon separation from employment. Notices to potential class members were sent out on February 2, 2021. Potential class members had until April 4, 2021 to opt-out of the class; however, the total number of employees in the class has not been definitively determined and is the subject of continuing discovery. The opt-out period has been extended until such time that discovery has concluded. In May 2023, the trial court requested additional briefing from the parties to determine whether the case should be maintained, dismissed, or the class de-certified. After submission of the briefs, the court requested that the parties submit stipulations for the court to rule upon. On February 13, 2024, the judge ordered the parties to submit additional briefing related to on-site breaks. The Court has ordered the parties to complete a second mediation no later than January 31, 2025. While we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss associated with this litigation, because there remains uncertainty under California law with respect to a significant legal issue, discovery relating to class members continues, and the trial judge retains discretion to award lower penalties than set forth in the applicable California employment laws, we do not believe that any potential loss to the Company is reasonably estimable at this time. As of September 30, 2024, amounts have been accrued. 
 On June 8, 2022, a lawsuit was filed against various Hilton entities on behalf of a class of all hourly employees at all Hilton-branded managed properties in California, including Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. The complaint includes claims for unpaid wages, meal and rest break violations, and unreimbursed business expenses, along with various derivative claims including wage statement, final pay, and Private Attorneys General Act PAGA claims. 
 On November 30, 2023, Hilton mediated this litigation, but it did not result in a settlement. At the end of the mediation, the mediator submitted a mediator s proposal for approximately million, to which the parties have since agreed to. The allocation to Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines is approximately , which has been accrued as of September 30, 2024. 
 We are also engaged in other legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. To the extent the claims giving rise to these legal proceedings are not covered by insurance, they relate to the following general types of claims: employment matters, tax matters and matters relating to compliance with applicable law (for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws). The likelihood of loss from these legal proceedings is based on the definitions within contingency accounting literature. We recognize a loss when we believe the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Based on the information available to us relating to these legal proceedings and/or our experience in similar legal proceedings, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

 class action lawsuits were filed, one in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and a second in the 68th District Court for Dallas County related to the cyber incident. The lawsuit filed in the 68th District Court was subsequently dismissed and refiled in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On March 12, 2024, the court ordered the cases be consolidated. The consolidated case is currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On May 17, 2024, we filed a Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which is currently pending before the Court. 
 Our assessment may change depending upon the development of any current or future legal proceedings, and the final results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If we ultimately do not prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses exceed our current estimates of the range of potential losses, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in future periods.

 Key Indicators of Operating Performance 
 We use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as other financial measures that are non-GAAP measures. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the operating performance of our individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or business as a whole. We also use these metrics to evaluate the hotels in our portfolio and potential acquisitions to determine each hotel s contribution to cash flow and its potential to provide attractive long-term total returns. These key indicators include: 
 Occupancy . Occupancy means the total number of hotel rooms sold in a given period divided by the total number of rooms available. Occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels available capacity. We use occupancy to measure demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. 
 ADR . ADR means average daily rate and is calculated by dividing total hotel rooms revenues by total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. We use ADR to assess the pricing levels that we are able to generate. 
 RevPAR. RevPAR means revenue per available room and is calculated by multiplying ADR by the average daily occupancy. RevPAR is one of the commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR does not include revenues from food and beverage sales or parking, telephone or other non-rooms revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels. We also use RevPAR to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels (comparable hotels represent hotels we have owned for the entire period). RevPAR improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs. RevPAR improvements attributable to increases in ADR are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs, such as management fees and franchise fees. 
 RevPAR changes that are primarily driven by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenues and profitability than changes that are driven primarily by changes in ADR. For example, an increase in occupancy at a hotel would lead to additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room supplies) and could also result in increased other operating department revenue and expense. Changes in ADR typically have a greater impact on operating margins and profitability as they do not have a substantial effect on variable operating costs. 
 Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the lodging industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our entire business. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a regional and company-wide basis. ADR and RevPAR include only rooms revenue. Rooms revenue is dictated by demand (as measured by occupancy), pricing (as measured by ADR) and our available supply of hotel rooms. 
 We also use funds from operations FFO ), Adjusted FFO, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as measures of the operating performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

 41 

We experienced an increase of 219,000 in direct expenses and a decrease of 1.6 million in indirect expenses and incentive management fees in the 2024 quarter as compared to the 2023 quarter. Direct expenses were 4.9 of total hotel revenue in the 2024 quarter and 4.4 in the 2023 quarter.

 Property Taxes, Insurance and Other . Property taxes, insurance and other decreased 486,000, or 4.6 , to 10.0 million in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. The decrease is primarily attributable to an aggregate decrease of approximately 1.1 million at eight comparable hotel properties as well as a decrease of 634,000 at the one disposed hotel property. These increases were partially offset by an aggregate increase of approximately 1.2 million primarily at the Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile, The Clancy, Cameo Beverly Hills, Marriott Seattle Waterfront, Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale, Capital Hilton, and Hotel Yountville.

 In the 2024 quarter, we recorded an advisory services fee of 8.6 million, which included a base advisory fee of 3.5 million, reimbursable expenses of 3.2 million, incentive fee of 1.5 million and equity-based compensation of 427,000.

 Corporate General and Administrative . Corporate general and administrative expense was 8.9 million in the 2024 quarter as compared to 2.5 million in the 2023 quarter.

 Interest Income . Interest income was 2.7 million and 1.0 million in the 2024 quarter and 2023 quarter, respectively. The increase in interest income in the 2024 quarter was primarily attributable to higher cash balances in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter as well as interest income associated with a tranche of CMBS included in investment in securities. 
 Other Income (Expense). In the 2023 quarter, we recorded 293,000 of miscellaneous income. 
 42 

Interest Expense and Amortization of Loan Costs . Interest expense and amortization of loan costs increased 4.6 million, or 19.8 , to 27.9 million in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. This increase is primarily due to higher interest expense from higher average interest rates. The average SOFR rates for the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter were 5.17 and 5.08 , respectively. 
 Write-off of Loan Costs and Exit Fees. Write-off of loan costs and exit fees was 5.3 million in the 2024 quarter, primarily related to various loan refinances and modifications. Write-off of loan costs and exit fees was 2.6 million in the 2023 quarter, primarily related to various loan modifications and costs associated with the 200 million secured credit facility. 
 Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives . Realized and unrealized loss on derivatives of 735,000 for 2024 quarter consisted of an unrealized loss on interest rate caps of approximately 1.7 million, partially offset by a realized gain of 1.0 million associated with payments received from counterparties on in-the-money interest rate caps. 
 Realized and unrealized gain on derivatives of 223,000 for 2023 quarter consisted of an unrealized gain on warrants of approximately 154,000 and a realized gain of 2.0 million associated with payments received from counterparties on in-the-money interest rate caps.

 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit . Income tax benefit decreased 326,000, from 1.2 million in the 2023 quarter to 864,000 in the 2024 quarter. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain of our TRS deferred tax assets in the 2024 quarter compared to the 2023 quarter. 
 (Income) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Entities. Our noncontrolling interest partner in consolidated entities was allocated income of 27.4 million and 1.8 million in the 2024 quarter and the 2023 quarter, respectively. The allocated income for the 2024 quarter includes our partner s share of gain on the sale of the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines.

 Other Operating Expenses . Other operating expenses decreased 1.8 million, or 1.0 , to 169.5 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. Other operating expenses consist of direct expenses from departments associated with revenue streams and indirect expenses associated with support departments and incentive management fees. 
 We experienced an increase of 808,000 in direct expenses and a decrease of 2.6 million in indirect expenses and incentive management fees in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. Direct expenses were 4.5 of total hotel revenue in the 2024 period and 4.3 in the 2023 period. 
 The increase in direct expenses is associated with higher direct expenses of approximately 1.5 million at eight comparable hotel properties. These increases were partially offset by lower direct expenses of 434,000 at The Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach, The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe, Cameo Beverly Hills, Hotel Yountville, The Clancy, The Notary Hotel, and Capital Hilton, as well as 238,000 at Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. 
 The decrease in indirect expenses comprises decreases in: (i) incentive management fees of 1.4 million comprising an aggregate decrease of 1.4 million at our 15 comparable hotel properties and an increase of 3,000 at the one disposed hotel property; (ii) lease expense of 1.4 million comprising an aggregate decrease of 35,000 at our 15 comparable hotel properties and a decrease of 1.3 million at the one disposed hotel property; (iii) general and administrative costs of 1.1 million comprising an aggregate decrease of 536,000 at our 15 comparable hotel properties and a decrease of 529,000 at the one disposed hotel property; and (iv) energy costs of 812,000 comprising an aggregate decrease of 318,000 at our 15 comparable hotel properties and a decrease of 494,000 at the one disposed hotel property. These decreases were partially offset by increases in: (i) repairs and maintenance of 1.0 million comprising an aggregate increase of 1.2 million at our 15 comparable hotel properties and a decrease of 206,000 at the one disposed hotel property; and (ii) marketing costs of 989,000 comprising an aggregate increase of 1.6 million at our 15 comparable hotel properties and a decrease of 583,000 at the one disposed hotel property. 
 Management Fees . Base management fees increased 252,000, or 1.4 , to 17.9 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. Management fees increased 1.0 million at six comparable hotel properties. These increases were partially offset by an aggregate decrease of 486,000 at The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe, Cameo Beverly Hills, The Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach, The Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas, Bardessono Hotel and Spa, The Clancy, Pier House Resort Spa, Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort Spa, and Hotel Yountville, as well as a decrease of 302,000 at Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. 
 Property Taxes, Insurance and Other . Property taxes, insurance and other increased 2.8 million, or 9.9 , to 30.7 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase of 2.4 million at the Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile related to a property tax refund received in the 2023 quarter and an aggregate increase of 
 46 

2.6 million at 12 hotel properties. These increases were partially offset by an aggregate decrease of approximately 1.8 million at two hotel properties, as well as a decrease of 417,000 at Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Depreciation and amortization increased 7.4 million, or 10.9 , to 75.2 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. This increase is comprised of an aggregate increase of 11.0 million at 11 comparable hotel properties. These increases were partially offset by an aggregate decrease of 2.8 million at The Notary Hotel, The Clancy, Pier House Resort Spa, and Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile, primarily due to fully depreciated assets, as well as a decrease of 795,000 at Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. 
 Advisory Services Fee. Advisory services fee decreased 28,000, or 0.1 , to 23.2 million in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period due to lower equity-based compensation of 4.0 million and base advisory fee of 532,000, partially offset by higher reimbursable expenses of 2.4 million and a higher incentive fee of 2.1 million. 
 In the 2024 period, we recorded an advisory services fee of 23.2 million, which included a base advisory fee of 10.2 million, reimbursable expenses of 8.5 million, 2.4 million associated with equity grants of our common stock and LTIP units awarded to the officers and employees of Ashford Inc. and an incentive fee of 2.1 million. 
 In the 2023 period, we recorded an advisory services fee of 23.2 million, which included a base advisory fee of 10.7 million, 6.4 million associated with equity grants of our common stock and LTIP units awarded to the officers and employees of Ashford Inc, and reimbursable expenses of 6.1 million. 
 Corporate General and Administrative . Corporate general and administrative expense was 11.1 million in the 2024 period compared to expense of 9.2 million in the 2023 period. The increase in corporate general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher professional fees of 5.1 million and 6.0 million of reimbursed legal costs in the 2024 period. These increases were partially offset by lower miscellaneous expenses of 268,000, lower public company costs of 215,000. and lower reimbursed operating expenses of Ashford Securities of 8.8 million. The decrease in Ashford Securities reimbursed operations expenses was related to a revision to the estimated contribution amount associated with the Fourth Amended and Restated Contribution Agreement with Ashford Securities that resulted in a 5.6 million credit to expense in 2024. 
 Gain (loss) on disposition of assets and hotel property . In the 2024 period, we recorded a gain of approximately 88.2 million related to the sale of Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. There was no such gain (loss) recorded for the 2023 period. 
 Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Entity . In the 2024 period and the 2023 period, we recorded equity in loss of unconsolidated entity of 214,000 and 208,000, respectively, related to our investment in OpenKey. 
 Other Income (Expense). In the 2023 period, we recorded 293,000 of miscellaneous income. 
 Interest Income . Interest income was 4.5 million and 5.4 million in the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. The decrease in interest income in the 2024 period was primarily attributable to lower average excess cash balances in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period, partially offset by interest income associated with a tranche of CMBS included in investment in securities. 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Discounts and Loan Costs . Interest expense and amortization of discounts and loan costs increased 11.9 million, or 17.1 , to 81.7 million for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The increase is primarily due to higher interest expense from higher average interest rates in the 2024 period. The average SOFR rates for the 2024 period and the 2023 period were 5.27 and 4.78 , respectively. 
 Write-off of Loan Costs and Exit Fees. Write-off of loan costs and exit fees was 6.1 million in the 2024 period related to various loan refinances and modifications. Write-off of loan costs and exit fees was 2.8 million in the 2023 period related to related to various loan modifications. 
 Gain (loss) on Extinguishment of Debt. In the 2024 period, we recognized a loss of 22,000 attributable to the discount associated with the Cameo Beverly Hills mortgage loan that was repaid on April 9, 2024. Gain on extinguishment of debt was 2.3 million in the 2023 period due to the payoff of The Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach mortgage loan. The gain was primarily attributable to the premium that was recorded upon the assumption of the mortgage loan when the hotel was acquired. 
 Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives . Realized and unrealized gain on derivatives of 523,000 for the 2024 period consisted of an unrealized gain on warrants of 12,000 and a realized gain of 4.2 million associated with payments received from counterparties on in-the-money interest rate caps, partially offset by an unrealized loss on interest rate caps of approximately 3.7 million. 
 47 

Realized and unrealized gain on derivatives of 918,000 for the 2023 period consisted of unrealized gain on warrants of 273,000 and a realized gain of 6.2 million associated with payments received from counterparties on in-the-money interest rate caps. These gains were partially offset by an unrealized loss on interest rate caps of approximately 5.5 million. 
 Income Tax (Expense) Benefit . Income tax expense decreased 590,000, from 1.1 million in the 2023 period to 474,000 in the 2024 period. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the taxable income of certain of our TRS entities in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. 
 (Income) Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Entities . Our noncontrolling interest partner in consolidated entities was allocated income of 26.3 million and 1.7 million in the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively. The allocated income for the 2024 period includes our partner s share of gain on the sale of the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. At September 30, 2024, noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities represented an ownership interest of 25 in one hotel property held by one entity. At September 30, 2023, noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities represented an ownership interest of 25 in two hotel properties held by one entity. 
 Net (Income) Loss Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in Operating Partnership. Noncontrolling interests in operating partnership were allocated a net loss of 1.7 million in the 2024 period and 3.0 million in the 2023 period. Redeemable noncontrolling interests represented ownership interests in Braemar OP of approximately 8.05 and 6.63 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotel properties, including: 
 advisory fees payable to Ashford LLC; 
 recurring maintenance necessary to maintain our hotel properties in accordance with brand standards; 
 interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness; 
 dividends on our common stock; 
 dividends on our preferred stock; and 
 capital expenditures to improve our hotel properties. 
 We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations, capital market activities, asset sales and existing cash balances. 
 Pursuant to the advisory agreement between us and our Advisor, we must pay our Advisor on a monthly basis a base advisory fee, subject to a minimum base advisory fee. The minimum base advisory fee is equal to the greater of: (i) 90 of the base fee paid for the same month in the prior fiscal year; and (ii) 1/12 th of the G A Ratio for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by our total market capitalization on the last balance sheet date included in the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K that we file with the SEC. Thus, even if our total market capitalization and performance decline, we will still be required to make payments to our Advisor equal to the minimum base advisory fee, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotel properties and redevelopments, renovations, expansions and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically with respect to our hotel properties and scheduled debt payments. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including future common and preferred equity issuances, existing working capital, net cash provided by operations, hotel mortgage indebtedness and other secured and unsecured borrowings. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, our unencumbered asset base and borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders (including as a result of any failure to comply with financial covenants in our existing and future indebtedness), general market conditions for REITs, our operating performance and liquidity and market perceptions about us. The success of our business strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to access these various capital sources. While management cannot provide any assurances, management believes that our cash flow from operations and our existing cash balances will be adequate to meet upcoming anticipated requirements for interest and principal payments on debt (excluding any potential final maturity principal payments and paydowns for extension tests), working capital, and capital expenditures for the next 12 months and dividends required to maintain our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Our hotel properties will require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. In addition, acquisitions, redevelopments or expansions of hotel properties may require significant capital outlays. We may not be able to 
 48 

fund such capital improvements solely from net cash provided by operations because we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, and we are subject to tax on any retained income and gains. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or hotel redevelopment through retained earnings is very limited. Consequently, we expect to rely heavily upon the availability of debt or equity capital for these purposes. If we are unable to obtain the necessary capital on favorable terms, or at all, our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Certain of our loan agreements contain cash trap provisions that may be triggered if the performance of our hotel properties declines. When these provisions are triggered, substantially all of the profit generated by the hotel properties securing such loan is deposited directly into lockbox accounts and then swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of our various lenders. This could affect our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders until such time that a cash trap is no longer in effect for such loan. These cash trap provisions have been triggered on one mortgage loan, as discussed below. Our loan that is in a cash trap may remain subject to the cash trap provisions for a substantial period of time which could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition or our qualification as a REIT. As of September 30, 2024, the mortgage loan secured by The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe was in a cash trap. The amount of cash in the cash trap as of September 30, 2024 was 0. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of 168.7 million and restricted cash of 48.5 million, the vast majority of which is comprised of lender and manager-held reserves. As of September 30, 2024, 19.9 million was also due to the Company from third-party hotel managers, most of which is held by one of the Company s managers and is available to fund hotel operating costs. At September 30, 2024, our net debt to gross assets was 41.0 . 
 The Company s cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of corporate cash invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities with maturity dates of less than 90 days and corporate cash held at commercial banks in Insured Cash Sweep ICS accounts, which are fully insured by the FDIC. The Company s cash and cash equivalents also includes property-level operating cash deposited with commercial banks that have been designated as a Global Systemically Important Bank G-SIB by the Financial Stability Board FSB and a small amount deposited with other commercial banks.

The timing and amount of any transactions will be subject to the discretion of the Company based upon market conditions, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company at its discretion without prior notice. The board of directors authorization replaced any previous repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not repurchased any common stock pursuant to the plan.

 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 We had approximately 168.7 million and 85.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We anticipate that our principal sources of funds to meet our cash requirements will include cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and capital market activities. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 60.2 million and 73.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows from operations were impacted by changes in hotel operations and the disposition of a hotel property. Cash flows from operations are also impacted by the timing of working capital cash flows, such as collecting receivables from hotel guests, paying vendors, settling with derivative counterparties, settling with related parties and settling with hotel managers. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by investing activities were 52.7 million. The cash inflows were primarily attributable to 155.6 million from the 
 50 

sale of Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines, partially offset by cash outflows of 42.3 million from the purchase of securities, 54.8 million of capital improvements made to various hotel properties, 5.8 million from the issuance of a note receivable and a 79,000 loan to OpenKey. Our capital improvements consisted of approximately 39.3 million of return on investment capital projects and approximately 15.5 million of renewal and replacement capital projects. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities were 55.6 million. These cash outflows were primarily attributable to 55.6 million of capital improvements made to various hotel properties and a 237,000 loan to OpenKey partially offset by cash inflows of 327,000 related to proceeds from property insurance. Our capital improvements consisted of approximately 36.8 million of return on investment capital projects and approximately 18.8 million of renewal and replacement capital projects. 
 Return on investment capital projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotel properties within their markets and competitive sets. Renewal and replacement capital projects are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels. 
 Net Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows used in financing activities were 62.2 million. Cash outflows primarily consisted of 184.1 million of repayments of indebtedness, 39.0 million of dividend and distribution payments, 1.3 million to purchase interest rate caps, 15.4 million of payments of loan costs and exit fees, 27.0 million distributions to noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities, and 36.3 million for cash redemptions of Series E and Series M preferred stock. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of 234.0 million from borrowings on indebtedness, 4.4 million of proceeds from in-the-money interest rate caps and 3.0 million of contributions from noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities were 126.3 million. Cash outflows primarily consisted of repayments of indebtedness of 390.2 million, 39.4 million of dividend and distribution payments, 19.3 million of payments to repurchase common stock, payments of 7.2 million for the redemption of operating partnership units, 4.0 million to purchase interest rate caps, 2.0 million of distributions to a noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities, 3.3 million payments of loan costs and exit fees, and 4.8 million for cash redemptions of Series E and Series M preferred stock. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of 236.0 million from borrowings on indebtedness, 97.9 million from the issuance of preferred stock, 4.1 million of contributions from a noncontrolling interest in consolidated entities and 6.0 million of proceeds from in-the-money interest rate caps. 
 
 Dividend Policy 
 On December 5, 2023, our board of directors approved the Company s dividend policy for 2024. The Company expects to pay a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share for the Company s common stock for 2024, or 0.20 per share on an annualized basis. On July 10, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024. On October 3, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024. The approval of our dividend policy does not commit our board of directors to declare future dividends with respect to any quantity or the amount thereof. The board of directors will continue to review our dividend policy on a quarter-to-quarter basis and make announcements with respect thereto. For income tax purposes, distributions paid consist of ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months and some during the winter months. This seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases. Quarterly revenue also may be adversely affected by renovations and repositionings, our managers effectiveness in generating business and by events beyond our control, such as pandemics, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, civil unrest, government shutdowns, airline strikes or reduced airline capacity, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel. To the extent that cash flows from operations and cash on hand are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue, we expect to utilize borrowings to fund distributions required to maintain our REIT status. However, we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our accounting policies that are critical 
 51 

or most important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in the section Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The following non-GAAP presentations of EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, FFO and Adjusted FFO are presented to help our investors evaluate our operating performance. 
 EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense and amortization of loan costs, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, equity in (earnings) loss of unconsolidated entity and after the Company s portion of EBITDA of OpenKey. In addition, we exclude impairment on real estate, (gain) loss on disposition of assets and hotel property and the Company s portion of EBITDAre of OpenKey from EBITDA to calculate EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDAre, as defined by NAREIT. 
 We then further adjust EBITDAre to exclude certain additional items such as amortization of favorable (unfavorable) contract assets (liabilities), transaction and conversion costs, other income/expense, write-off of loan costs and exit fees, gain/loss on insurance settlements, advisory and settlement costs, advisory services incentive fee, gain/loss on extinguishment of debt, stock/unit-based compensation and the Company s portion of adjustments to EBITDAre of OpenKey and non-cash items such as unrealized gain/ loss on derivatives. 
 We present EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre because we believe they are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because they provide investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business. We also believe they help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results. Our management team also uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as calculated by us may not be comparable to EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre reported by other companies that do not define EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre exactly as we define the terms. EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as an indicator of liquidity.

FFO is calculated on the basis defined by NAREIT, which is net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses on insurance settlement and disposition of assets, plus impairment charges on real estate, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after redeemable noncontrolling interests in the operating partnership and adjustments for unconsolidated entities. NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined by GAAP. Our calculation of Adjusted FFO excludes transaction and conversion costs, other income/expense, write-off of loan costs and exit fees, legal, advisory and settlement costs, advisory services incentive fee, stock/unit-based compensation, severance, gain/loss on insurance settlements, gain/loss on extinguishment of debt, and non-cash items such as deemed dividends on redeemable preferred stock, interest expense accretion on refundable membership club deposits, amortization of loan costs, unrealized gain/loss on derivatives and the Company s portion of adjustments to FFO of OpenKey. FFO and Adjusted FFO exclude amounts attributable to the portion of a partnership owned by the third party. We present FFO and Adjusted FFO because we consider FFO and Adjusted FFO important supplemental measures of our operational performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO and Adjusted FFO when reporting their results. FFO and Adjusted FFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO and Adjusted FFO exclude depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets, gains and losses from real property dispositions and impairment losses on real estate assets, FFO and Adjusted FFO provide performance measures that, when compared year over year, reflect the effect to operations from trends in occupancy, guestroom rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. We consider FFO and Adjusted FFO to be appropriate measures of our ongoing normalized operating performance as a REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that either do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or interpret the NAREIT definition differently than us. FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or loss as an indication of our financial performance or GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. FFO and Adjusted FFO are also not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. However, to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results, we believe that FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered along with our net income or loss and cash flows reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 (3) The above information does not include the operations of the voluntary rental program with respect to residential units not owned by the Company. 
 (4) Some of our hotel properties are on land subject to ground leases, one of which covers the entire property. 
 (5) The initial ground lease expires in 2065. The ground lease contains two 25-year extension options, at our election. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates. To the extent that we acquire assets or conduct operations in an international jurisdiction, we will also have currency exchange risk. We may enter into certain hedging arrangements in order to manage interest rate and currency fluctuations. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. 
 At September 30, 2024, our total indebtedness of approximately 1.2 billion included approximately 1.1 billion of variable-rate debt. The impact on the results of operations of a 25-basis point change in the interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024, would be approximately 2.8 million per year. However, we currently have various interest rate caps in place that limit this exposure. Interest rate changes have no impact on the remaining 86.3 million of fixed-rate debt. 
 The above amounts were determined based on the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowings and assume no changes in our capital structure. The information presented above includes those exposures that existed at September 30, 2024, but it does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date. Accordingly, the information presented herein has limited predictive value. As a result, the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on exposures that arise during the period, the hedging strategies at the time, and the related interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that (i) information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and 
 56 

communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 On December 20, 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against one of the Company s hotel management companies in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Contra Costa alleging violations of certain California employment laws, which class action affects two hotels owned by subsidiaries of the Company. The court has entered an order granting class certification with respect to: (i) a statewide class of non-exempt employees of our manager who were allegedly deprived of rest breaks as a result of our manager s previous written policy requiring its employees to stay on premises during rest breaks; and (ii) a derivative class of non-exempt former employees of our manager who were not paid for allegedly missed breaks upon separation from employment. Notices to potential class members were sent out on February 2, 2021. Potential class members had until April 4, 2021 to opt out of the class; however, the total number of employees in the class has not been definitively determined and is the subject of continuing discovery. The opt-out period has been extended until such time that discovery has concluded. In May 2023, the trial court requested additional briefing from the parties to determine whether the case should be maintained, dismissed, or the class de-certified. After submission of the briefs, the court requested that the parties submit stipulations for the court to rule upon. On February 13, 2024, the judge ordered the parties to submit additional briefing related to on-site breaks. The Court has ordered the parties to complete a second mediation no later than January 31, 2025. While we believe it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss associated with this litigation, because there remains uncertainty under California law with respect to a significant legal issue, discovery relating to class members continues, and the trial judge retains discretion to award lower penalties than set forth in the applicable California employment laws, we do not believe that any potential loss to the Company is reasonably estimable at this time. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts have been accrued. 
 On June 8, 2022 a lawsuit was filed against various Hilton entities on behalf of a class of all hourly employees at all Hilton-branded managed properties in California, including Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines. The complaint includes claims for unpaid wages, meal and rest break violations, and unreimbursed business expenses, along with various derivative claims including wage statement, final pay, and Private Attorneys General Act PAGA claims. 
 On November 30, 2023, Hilton mediated this litigation, but it did not result in a settlement. At the end of the mediation, the mediator submitted a mediator s proposal for approximately 3.5 million, which the parties have since agreed to. The allocation to Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines is approximately 371,000, which has been accrued as of September 30, 2024. 
 We are also engaged in other legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. To the extent the claims giving rise to these legal proceedings are not covered by insurance, they relate to the following general types of claims: employment matters, tax matters and matters relating to compliance with applicable law (for example, the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws). The likelihood of loss from these legal proceedings is based on the definitions within contingency accounting literature. We recognize a loss when we believe the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Based on the information available to us relating to these legal proceedings and/or our experience in similar legal proceedings, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we had a cyber incident that resulted in the potential exposure of certain personal information. We have completed an investigation and have identified certain information that may have been exposed and notified potentially impacted individuals pursuant to applicable state guidelines. All systems have been restored. We believe that we maintain a sufficient level of insurance coverage related to such events, and the related incremental costs incurred to date are immaterial. In February of 2024, two class action lawsuits were filed, one in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas and a second in the 68th District Court for Dallas County related to the cyber incident. The lawsuit filed in the 68th District Court was subsequently dismissed and refiled in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On March 12, 2024, the court ordered the two cases be consolidated. The consolidated case is currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On May 17, 2024, we filed a Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which is currently pending before the Court. 
 Our assessment may change depending upon the development of any current or future legal proceedings, and the final results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If we ultimately do not prevail in one or more of these legal 
 57 

matters, and the associated realized losses exceed our current estimates of the range of potential losses, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in future periods. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The discussion of our business and operations should be read together with the risk factors contained in Item 1A to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC, which describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, or prospects in a material and adverse manner. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer 
 On May 3, 2024, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program, pursuant to which the board of directors granted a repurchase authorization to acquire shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, having an aggregate value of up to 50 million. The Company intends to begin share repurchases as soon as practicable and may repurchase shares through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or other means. The timing and amount of any transactions will be subject to the discretion of the Company based upon market conditions, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company at its discretion without prior notice. The board of directors authorization replaced any previous repurchase authorizations. 
 The following table provides the information with respect to purchases and forfeitures of our common stock during each of the months in the third quarter of 2024:
