 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 par value per share, at a rate of (the Reverse Stock Split ), effective as of 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on June 14, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split decreased the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding from shares to shares, subject to adjustment for the rounding up of fractional shares. Accordingly, each holder of Common Stock now owns fewer shares of Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. However, the Reverse Stock Split affected all holders of Common Stock uniformly and did not affect any stockholder s percentage ownership interest in the Company, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in an adjustment to a stockholder s ownership of Common Stock due to the treatment of fractional shares in the Reverse Stock Split. Therefore, voting rights and other rights and preferences of the holders of Common Stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split (other than as a result of the treatment of fractional shares). Common stock issued pursuant to the Reverse Stock Split remains fully paid and nonassessable, without any change in the par value per share. The Common Stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market on June 14, 2024. The trading symbol for the Common Stock remains TRNR. The new CUSIP number for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split is 45840Y203. Initial Public Offering In May 2023, the Company closed its initial public offering ("IPO") in which we issued and sold shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share and excluding shares sold in the IPO by certain of our existing stockholders. Total proceeds, after deducting underwriting commissions of million and other offering expenses of million, was million. Acquisition of CLMBR, Inc. On October 6, 2023, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement with CLMBR and CLMBR1, LLC (collectively, the Sellers to purchase and acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of the Sellers. On January 22, 2024, the Company and the Sellers entered into an amended and restated Asset Purchase Agreement (the Amended Agreement ). On February 2, 2024, pursuant to the Amended Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition for a total purchase price of approximately million, consisting of (i) cash of , (ii) shares of the Company s common stock with a fair value in the aggregate of million, (iii) shares of the Company s non-voting Series B preferred stock with a fair value in the aggregate of million, (iv) contingent consideration with a fair value of million, and (v) the retirement of million of senior debt and million in related fees, such retirement to be in the form of a million cash payment to the lender of the senior debt and the issuance of an million promissory note to such lender (the Acquisition ). The Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805, Business Combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as of February 2, 2024, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. See Note 21. that outlines the Company s consideration transferred and the identifiable net assets acquired at their estimated fair value as of February 2, 2024. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Interactive Strength Inc.

million and used net cash in its operations of million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. Management expects the Company will continue to incur significant operating losses and use net cash in its operations for the foreseeable future. 

 As of the issuance date, the Company had approximately million of cash or cash equivalents available to fund its operations and no available sources of financing or capital to sustain its operations for a period of 12 months beyond the issuance date. 

 The Company expects to incur substantial expenditures to invest in its operations and growth for the foreseeable future. In order to fund these investments, the Company will need to secure additional sources of credit from lenders or capital investment from public and private investors (collectively outside capital ). While the Company is actively seeking to secure additional outside capital (and has historically been able to successfully secure such capital) to fund its operations, no additional outside capital has been secured or was deemed probable of being secured as of the issuance date. In addition, management can provide no assurance the Company will be able to secure additional outside capital or on acceptable terms. Absent an ability to secure additional outside capital in the very near term, the Company will be unable to meet fund its operations over the next 12 months beyond the issuance date. 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total outstanding debt of approximately million, all of which was classified as current in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. Approximately million of this debt pertains to personal loans from certain individual related parties disclosed in Note 20. Several of these loans matured prior to September 30, 2024, but their repayment has been temporarily waived. While the Company is actively seeking to secure additional outside capital (and has historically been able to successfully secure such capital) to repay these outstanding borrowings, no additional outside capital has been secured or was deemed probable of being secured as of the issuance date. In addition, management can provide no assurance the Company will be able to secure additional outside capital or on acceptable terms. In the event the Company is unable to secure additional outside capital and/or secure amendments or waivers from its lenders to defer or modify the repayment terms of the Company s outstanding indebtedness, management will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment of the Company s operations, a sale of certain of the Company s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors, and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent by filing for bankruptcy protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

 As previously disclosed, on August 22, 2023, the Listing Qualifications staff (the Staff of Nasdaq had notified the Company that it did not comply with the minimum million stockholders equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Rule ). On February 16, 2024, the Company filed a Form 8-K stating that as of February 15, 2024, as a result of the Company s debt conversion and acquisition, the Company believed it had regained compliance with the Rule. Based on this representation, the Staff notified the Company that it regained compliance with the Rule; however, the Staff noted that if the Company failed to evidence compliance upon filing its periodic report for the period ended March 31, 2024, it may be subject to delisting. On May 22, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter from the Staff advising the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company

million, exceeding the minimum required by the Rule by over million. Despite the Company s net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company achieved this compliance via (A) the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to (i) a registered direct offering; (ii) the At The Market offering; and (iii) the extinguishment of debt; and (B) the issuance of preferred stock shares upon the extinguishment of debt. 

 The Company believes that it will stay compliant with the Rule through the end of the fiscal year and beyond because, since September 30, 2024, the Company has issued more shares of common stock pursuant to the At The Market offering and the extinguishment of debt. The Company received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq on August 20, 2024 notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Common Stock has been below the minimum per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) Rule 5550(a)(2) ). The Nasdaq deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Common Stock, and the Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol TRNR at this time. The Company has 180 calendar days, or until February 18, 2024, to regain compliance. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s securities must be at least per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If compliance is not regained by February 18, 2024, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or if otherwise not eligible, the Company may request a hearing before a hearings panel. If the Company fails to regain compliance and/or secure an extension, the Company will be subject to being delisted from the Nasdaq market. If a delisting occurs, the Company will be faced with a number of material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for its common stock; limited news and analyst coverage; decreased ability to obtain additional financing or failure to comply with the covenants required by the Company s borrowing arrangement; limited liquidity for the Company s stockholders due to thin trading; and a potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and other third parties who do business with the Company. 

 The Company received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq on November 13, 2024 notifying the Company that, since at November 12, 2024, the Company had publicly held shares, it no longer meets the minimum publicly held shares requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) Rule 5550(a)(4) ). The Nasdaq deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Common Stock, and the Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol TRNR at this time. The Company has until November 20, 2024 to present its views with respect to this additional deficiency to the Panel in writing. As of November 13, 2024, the Company has publicly held shares and believes this deficiency has been cured. However, if the Company fails regain compliance and/or secure an extension, the Company will be subject to being delisted from the Nasdaq market. If a delisting occurs, the Company will be faced with a number of material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for its common stock; limited news and analyst coverage; decreased ability to obtain additional financing or failure to comply with the covenants required by the Company s borrowing arrangement; limited liquidity for the Company s stockholders due to thin trading; and a potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and other third parties who do business with the Company. 

 These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

The Company s intangible assets subject to amortization consist of developed technology, customer related intangibles, trademark and tradenames, and content that are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related intangible asset. The estimated useful lives of the respective intangible assets range from years to years. The Company estimates the fair value of intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets. This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates for this category of intellectual property, discount rates and other variables. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. For the periods presented, the Company did not recognize any impairment of intangible assets.

Using the benefit of hindsight, we determined that the straight-line calculation would provide the most appropriate conclusion for the valuation of our common stock on the interim dates between valuations because we did not identify any single event or series of events that occurred during this interim period that would have caused a material change in fair value. Based on this calculation, we assessed the fair value of our common stock for awards granted in January 2023 to be per share.

 Overview 
 Interactive Strength Inc. is the parent company of two leading brands serving the commercial and at-home markets with specialty fitness equipment and virtual training: CLMBR and FORME. CLMBR manufactures vertical climbing equipment and provides a unique digital and on-demand training platform. FORME is a hardware manufacturer and digital fitness service provider that combines award-winning smart gyms with live 1:1 personal training (from real humans) to deliver an immersive experience. The combination of technology with expert training leads to better outcomes for both consumers and trainers alike. CLMBR and FORME offer unique fitness solutions for both the commercial and at-home markets. 
 
 Key milestones in our growth history include: 
 May 2017 Interactive Strength Inc. founded 

July 2021 Commenced commercial delivery of FORME Studio (fitness mirror), our first connected fitness hardware product 

July 2022 Live 1:1 personal training service launched 

August 2022 Commenced commercial delivery of FORME Studio Lift (fitness mirror and cable-based digital resistance) 

April 2023 Interactive Strength went public on NASDAQ with ticker TRNR 

February 2024 Acquired substantially all of the assets of CLMBR, Inc. 

Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our connected fitness hardware products and associated recurring membership revenue. As we launched our first connected fitness hardware product in July 2021, we began generating revenue from sales of our products starting in the second half of 2021. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated total revenue of 2.0 million and 0.3 million and 3.0 million and 0.8 million, respectively, and incurred net losses of (7.1) million and (10.4) million and (29.2) million and (40.0) million, respectively. As we generated recurring net losses and negative operating cash flow during the research and development stage of the FORME Studio and FORME Studio Lift products, we have funded our operations primarily with gross proceeds from the sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, the sale of our SAFE notes, the issuance of convertible notes, and the issuance of common stock. 
 Business Model and Growth Strategy 
 
 Acquire complementary businesses that generate attractive synergies 
 We acquired CLMBR in February 2024 and believe that there are other compelling businesses to be acquired. We expect that we will be able to acquire revenue-generating businesses, which would generate higher earnings and cashflow through synergies with our 
 43 

existing business. Our team has significant experience in M A and we are one of the few companies in our industry with a public currency, which we believe makes us an attractive acquiror. 
 
 Leverage well established equipment distributors to scale in commercial channels 
 We have high value partnerships with distributors, including Woodway, to sell CLMBR and FORME products into a variety of commercial environments. These relationships allow us to leverage the sales knowledge, relationships and specialization of third parties to accelerate our sales initiatives. Importantly, this construct allows us to make the vast majority of our sales related expenses variable, as we typically pay commissions only when units are sold. 
 
 Expand into new geographies 
 We intend to expand the international reach of our product and service offerings. With more than 180 million people belonging to gyms globally in 2019, according to IHRSA, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow internationally. For example, we are currently evaluating potential international expansion in the United Kingdom and Canada, although we have not yet made any definitive plans regarding such expansion or the potential timing thereof. We plan to continue to pursue disciplined international expansion by targeting countries with high fitness penetration and spend, as well as the presence of boutique fitness, and where we believe both CLMBR and FORME s value propositions will resonate. 
 
 Increase uptake of add-on services through compelling member experience 
 We intend to increase uptake of our add-on memberships and services by providing a compelling member experience focused on introducing our members to the variety of services available on our platform and specifically, the value-added benefits of our coaching and personal training offering. We believe our ability to provide service offerings at a number of price points will serve as a valuable lever for growth by increasing overall service revenues over time. 
 
 Reduce the cost of personal training and expand addressable market without sacrificing quality 
 We intend to continue to explore ways to leverage our products, technology, and proprietary trainer education platform to bring the cost of coaching down incrementally, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the quality of the coaching experience we deliver to our members. This strategy is key to our medium- to long-term objectives, as we believe we can expand the addressable market for coaching services by reducing the per session cost and increasing accessibility of expert coaching services through our hardware and mobile experiences. 
 
 Build out partnership ecosystem 
 We intend to continue to build our strategic partner ecosystem with a focus on relationships that enable us to extend our platform to new audiences. We are pursuing opportunities in a number of attractive verticals, including sports, physical therapy and rehabilitation, and telemedicine. We are continuously identifying and evaluating opportunities to apply our coaching know-how in new and innovative ways to expand our reach and impact. 
 
 Expand corporate wellness 
 We intend to expand our recently launched corporate wellness initiative. Historically, corporate wellness programs were generally one-size-fits-all solutions for employees, such as corporate gyms. The rise of the hybrid workforce has made robust corporate wellness both an imperative and a challenge for many companies. We believe our comprehensive product portfolio makes us a better fit for modern corporate wellness programs than many existing alternatives. Our solution enables corporations to provide all of their employees with a coaching platform regardless of whether they work from home, in the office, or both. Our multi-pronged service offering also provides a new level of customization that can be adapted to employees at virtually all levels of tenure. 
 
 Target Sport Specific Markets 
 We intend to reach sport specific markets, specifically golf, tennis and pickleball, which have historically been underserved by the fitness market. Golf is one of the fastest growing sports in the United States. According to the National Golf Foundation, golf participation grew 10 year-over-year surpassing 41.1 million in 2022. In 2023, on-course golfers rose for the fifth consecutive year. Similarly for tennis, according to data from the United States Tennis Association, and the Tennis Industry Association Participation and Engagement Study, in 2022 there were 23.6 million players, a 33 increase since the beginning of 2020. Pickleball has solidified its status as America's fastest-growing sport for the third consecutive year. According to the 2023 Sports Fitness Industry Association's (SFIA) Topline Participation Report, participation in pickleball almost doubled in 2022, showing an 85.7 percent increase year-over-year and a staggering 158.6 percent increase over the past three years. Each of these sports, as well as others, benefit greatly from high quality strength and conditioning as well as the style of training that can be provided by both a cable-based 
 44 

system and vertical climbing. Providing greater access to quality training to support place is a high value service in both commercial and direct to consumer markets. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: 
 We have a limited operating history; and our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of our ability to successfully establish our product and service offerings in the marketplace, or of our future performance, and our revenue growth rate is likely to slow as our business matures. 

We derive a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our CLMBR vertical climbing machine, FORME Studio and FORME Studio Lift equipment and if sales of our CLMBR vertical climbing machine, FORME Studio and FORME Studio Lift equipment decline, it would materially and negatively affect our future revenue and results of operations. 

Our membership revenue is largely dependent on our ability to sell our CLMBR vertical climbing machine, FORME Studio equipment and if sales of our FORME Studio equipment decline, our membership revenue would decline, and it would materially and negatively affect our future revenue and results of operations. Similarly, we may be unable to attract and retain members, which could have an adverse effect on our business and rate of growth. 

If we fail to compete successfully against existing and future competitors, we may fail to obtain a meaningful market share, which in turn would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Increases in component and equipment costs, long lead times, supply shortages, and supply changes could disrupt our supply chain and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources, and our ability to obtain additional funding as needed for our operations and to execute on our strategy. 

Our ability to execute or realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic acquisition or transaction. 

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some disruptions to parts of our supply chain, including procuring necessary components or parts in a timely fashion, with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation and raising prices. In addition, disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure have increased delivery times for materials and components or parts of our fitness equipment, and has impacted, and could in the future impact, our ability to timely deliver our products to customers. These supply chain disruptions have not materially affected our business outlook and goals or our operating results, including our sales, revenue, or liquidity or capital resources, and we have not implemented any mitigation efforts to date as a result. However, we cannot predict the impact to us of any future or prolonged supply chain disruptions or any mitigation efforts we may take going forward. For example, as a result of these supply chain disruptions, we may be required to increase customer order lead times and place some products on allocation. In addition, we may consider additional or alternative third-party manufacturing and logistics providers or suppliers. Such mitigation efforts may result in cost increases and any attempts to offset such increases with price increases may result in reduced sales, increased customer dissatisfaction, or otherwise harm our reputation. Further, if we were to elect to transition or add manufacturing or logistics providers or suppliers, it may result in temporary or additional delays in product delivery or risks related to consistent product quality or reliability. This in turn may limit our ability to fulfill customer orders and we may be unable to satisfy all of the demand for our products. We may in the future also purchase components further in advance, which in return can result in less capital being allocated to other activities such as marketing and other business needs. We cannot quantify the impact of such disruptions at this time or predict the impact of any mitigation efforts we may take in response to supply chain disruptions on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 In addition, customer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, inflation, weak growth, recession, equity market volatility, or other negative economic factors in the United States or other nations. The United States has recently experienced historically high levels of inflation. If the inflation rate continues to increase, it will likely affect our expenses, including, but not limited to, employee compensation expenses, increased manufacturing and supplier costs, and increasing market prices of certain components, parts, supplies, and commodity raw materials, which are incorporated into our products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our products. These components, parts, supplies, and commodities may from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions may affect pricing of such components, parts, supplies and commodities, such as inflation or supply chain constraints. Given our limited operating history, we cannot predict how ongoing or increasing recessionary or inflationary pressures may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future.

Components of Our Operating Results 
 We generate revenue from sales of our connected fitness products, membership revenue, and personal training revenue. We identify our reportable segment based on the information used by management to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 2. of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our reportable segment. 
 Revenue 
 Connected Fitness Product 
 Connected Fitness Product revenue consists of sales of our connected fitness products and related accessories, delivery and installation services, and extended warranty agreements offered through a third-party. Fitness Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery, except for extended warranty revenue which is recognized over the warranty period. For the third-party extended warranty service sold along with the connected fitness products, we do not obtain control of the warranty before transferring it to the customers. Therefore, we account for revenue related to the fees paid to the third-party extended warranty provider on a net basis, by recognizing only the net commission we retain. Connected fitness product revenue represented 80 and 67 and 64 and 64 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Membership 
 Membership revenue consists of revenue generated from our monthly Connected Fitness membership. Membership revenue represented 11 and 12 and 20 and 12 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Training 
 Training revenue consists of sales of our personal training services delivered through our connected fitness products and third-party mobile devices. Training revenue is recognized at the time of delivery. Training revenue represented 9 and 20 and 16 and 23 of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Connected Fitness Product 
 Connected Fitness Product cost of revenue consists of Studio and Studio Lift and accessories product costs, including manufacturing costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, and certain allocated costs related to management and facilities expenses associated with supply chain logistics. 
 Membership 
 Membership cost of revenue includes costs associated with personnel related expenses, filming and production costs, hosting fees, music royalties, and amortization of capitalized software development costs. 
 Training 
 Training cost of revenue includes costs associated with personnel related expenses. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel and facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and software platform expenses. We capitalize certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software and software to be sold or marketed which may also cause research and development expenses to vary from period to period. 
 46 

Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expense consists of performance marketing media spend, asset creation, and other brand creative, all showroom expenses and related lease payments, payment processing fees incurred in connection with the sale of our connected fitness products, and sales and marketing personnel-related expenses. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses and facilities-related costs primarily for our executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and IT functions. General and administrative expense also includes fees for professional services principally comprised of legal, audit, tax and accounting services, and insurance. 
 We expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance and reporting obligations of public companies, and increased costs for insurance, investor relations expenses, and professional services. As a result, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, but we expect to leverage these expenses over time as we grow our revenue and member base. 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 Other (expense) income, net consists of unrealized currency gains and losses, loss on exchange of warrants for equity, and fair value of issuance of Loss Restoration Agreement derivative. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest associated with the related party loans, term loans, convertible notes, senior secured notes and waiver consideration granted to December 2023 Notes and Equity Line of Credit. 
 Loss on issuance of warrants 
 Loss on issuance of warrants consists of fair value of issuance of warrants issued in connection with Registered Direct Offering and Best Efforts Offering. 
 Change in Fair Value of Convertible Notes 
 The change in fair value of convertible notes consists of the change in the fair value of the outstanding convertible notes since the previous reporting period. 
 Change in Fair Value of Earn Out 
 The change in fair value of earn out consists of the change in the fair value of the outstanding contingent considerations since the previous reporting period. 
 Change in Fair Value of Derivatives 
 The change in fair value of derivatives consists of the change in the fair value of the outstanding derivatives since the previous reporting period. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrants 
 The change in fair value of warrants consists of the change in the fair value of the outstanding warrants notes since the previous reporting period. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized. 
 47

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 0.0 million and 0.1 million and 0.2 million and 0.7 million of stock-based compensation was capitalized as software costs, respectively. 
 In December 2022, the Company enacted a restructuring cost savings initiative which resulted in employee terminations in both December 2022 and January 2023. In association with the January 2023 terminations, the Company accelerated the vesting of a number of individual option awards, resulting in the accelerated vesting of 148 shares on the date of modification. Also in January 2023, the Company repriced 7,538 option awards. Both the accelerated vesting and repricing were accounted for as an equity award modification under ASC Topic 718 which resulted in adjustment of the award value to reflect the fair value at the modification date and acceleration of the recognition schedule in the case of awards which were modified to have accelerated vesting. The adjustment resulted in additional expense of 0.5 million.

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

 Research and Development 
 Research and development decreased 0.1 million or 6 and decreased 1.1 million and 14 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in personnel-related costs of 0.2 million and from a reduction in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 0.1 million offset by an increase of 0.2 million in software and subscriptions related to the acquisition of CLMBR, Inc. The decrease of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses from a reduction in headcount of 0.3 million, and a decrease in stock-based 
 50 

compensation expenses of 1.3 million partially offset by an increase of 0.4 million in software and subscriptions related to the acquisition of CLMBR, Inc.

The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses from a reduction in headcount of 0.03 million and 0.2 million, respectively, a decrease of 0.02 million and 0.2 million in advertising and marketing, respectively, a decrease of 0.01 million and 0.4 million in consulting, respectively, a decrease in stock-based compensation of 0.1 million and 0.4 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of customer related intangibles from the acquisition of CLMBR, Inc. of 0.1 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expense decreased 1.3 million or 20 and 14.6 million or 49 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to decreases of 1.5 million and 12.6 million, respectively in stock-based compensation expenses, decreases of 0.3 million and 2.7 million in consulting, accounting and tax expenses, respectively, and decreases of 0.3 million and 0.4 million in depreciation and amortization, respectively, offset by increase of 0.1 million and 0.5 million in insurance, respectively, with the remaining difference due to change in other miscellaneous expenses.

 Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and accounts payable was a result of conversion of promissory loans and senior secured debt into convertible notes resulting in a gain of 0.1 million and loss of 1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Change in Fair Value of Convertible Notes, Change in the Fair Value of Earn out, Change in Fair Value of Derivatives, Change in Fair Value of Warrants 
 Change in fair value of convertible notes, earn out, derivatives and warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were due to change in fair value of these financial instruments. The change in fair value of convertible notes was driven by the conversion of bridge loans to Series A Preferred Stock, change in the fair value of earn out was due to the Company's remote chance of obtaining the 2024 unit sales targets, change in fair value of derivatives was due to the Loss Restoration agreement, and the change in fair value of warrants was attributable to the change in fair value of warrants issued with December 2023 Note, February 2024 Convertible Note and Registered Direct Offering in May 2024 and Best Efforts Offering in July 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), or ASU 205-40, management evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. 
 As an emerging growth company, the Company is subject to certain inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the development of an enterprise. In this regard, since the Company s inception, substantially all of management s efforts have been devoted to making investments in research and development including the development of revenue generating products and services and the development of a commercial organization, all at the expense of short-term profitability. 
 As of the date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were issued (the issuance date ), management evaluated the following adverse conditions and events present at the Company in accordance with ASU 205-40: 
 Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant operating losses and used net cashflows in its operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net operating loss of 25.1 million and used net cash in its operations of 8.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 196.6 million. Management expects the Company will continue to incur significant operating losses and use net cash in its operations for the foreseeable future. 

As of the issuance date, the Company had approximately 1.0 million of cash or cash equivalents available to fund its operations and no available sources of financing or capital to sustain its operations for a period of 12 months beyond the issuance date. 

The Company expects to incur substantial expenditures to invest in its operations and growth for the foreseeable future. In order to fund these investments, the Company will need to secure additional sources of credit from lenders or capital investment from public and private investors (collectively outside capital ). While the Company is actively seeking to secure additional outside capital (and has historically been able to successfully secure such capital) to fund its operations, no additional outside capital has been secured or was deemed probable of being secured as of the issuance date. In addition, management can provide no assurance the Company will be able to secure additional outside capital or on acceptable terms. Absent an ability to secure additional outside capital in the very near term, the Company will be unable to meet fund its operations over the next 12 months beyond the issuance date. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total outstanding debt of approximately 14.1 million, all of which was classified as current in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. Approximately 5.2 million of this debt pertains to personal loans from certain individual related parties disclosed in Note 20. Several of these loans matured prior 

52 

to September 30, 2024, but their repayment has been temporarily waived, and the remaining loans are scheduled to mature over the next 12 m onths beyond the issuance date. Accordingly, as of the issuance date, the Company s total outstanding debt was approximately 14.1 million, including accrued, but unpaid interest and penalties on delayed interest payments, all of which is currently due or scheduled to mature over the next 12 twelve months beyond the issuance date. While the Company is actively seeking to secure additional outside capital (and has historically been able to successfully secure such capital) to repay these outstanding borrowings, no additional outside capital has been secured or was deemed probable of being secured as of the issuance date. In addition, management can provide no assurance the Company will be able to secure additional outside capital or on acceptable terms. In the event the Company is unable to secure additional outside capital and/or secure amendments or waivers from its lenders to defer or modify the repayment terms of the Company s outstanding indebtedness, management will be required to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include, among others, a significant curtailment of the Company s operations, a sale of certain of the Company s assets, a sale of the entire Company to strategic or financial investors, and/or allowing the Company to become insolvent by filing for bankruptcy protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

As previously disclosed, on August 22, 2023, the Listing Qualifications staff (the Staff of Nasdaq had notified the Company that it did not comply with the minimum 2.5 million stockholders equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Rule ). On February 16, 2024, the Company filed a Form 8-K stating that as of February 15, 2024, as a result of the Company s debt conversion and acquisition, the Company believed it had regained compliance with the Rule. Based on this representation, the Staff notified the Company that it regained compliance with the Rule; however, the Staff noted that if the Company failed to evidence compliance upon filing its periodic report for the period ended March 31, 2024, it may be subject to delisting. On May 22, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter from the Staff advising the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company no longer complies with the Rule. Specifically, the Staff noted that the Company s stockholders equity reported in its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 did not satisfy the minimum 2.5 million stockholders equity requirement for continued listing. The Company appeared before a Hearings Panel (the Panel on July 16th. On August 6, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Panel stating that the Panel has determined to grant the request of the Company to continue its listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market until November 14, 2024. The Company s continued listing is subject to the condition that on or before November 14, 2024, i) the Company files a Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2024, describing the transactions undertaken by the Company to achieve compliance and demonstrate long-term compliance with the Rule and provide an indication of its equity following those transactions; and ii) the Company provides the Panel with income projections for the next 12 months. While the Company believes it is now compliant with the Rule, there can be no assurance that the Panel will stay the suspension of the Company s securities. If the Company s securities are delisted from Nasdaq, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company s common stock or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company s common stock could suffer a material decline. Delisting could also impair the Company s ability to raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements or securities of the Company. 

The Company s stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.8 million, exceeding the minimum required by the Rule by over 3 million. Despite the Company s net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company achieved this compliance via (A) the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to (i) a registered direct offering; (ii) the At The Market offering; and (iii) the extinguishment of debt; and (B) the issuance of preferred stock shares upon the extinguishment of debt. 

The Company believes that it will stay compliant with the Rule through the end of the fiscal year and beyond because, since September 30, 2024, the Company has issued more shares of common stock pursuant to the At The Market offering and the extinguishment of debt. 
 The Company received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq on August 20, 2024 notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for the Company s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock has been below the minimum 1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) Rule 5550(a)(2) ). The Nasdaq deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Common Stock, and the Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol TRNR at this time. The Company has 180 calendar days, or until February 18, 2024, to regain compliance. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s securities must be at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If compliance is not regained by February 18, 2024, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or if otherwise not eligible, the Company may request a hearing before a hearings panel. If the Company fails to regain compliance and/or secure an extension, the Company will be subject to being delisted from the Nasdaq market. If a delisting occurs, the Company will be faced with a number of material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for its common stock; limited news and analyst coverage; decreased ability to obtain additional financing or failure to comply with the covenants required by the Company s borrowing arrangement; limited liquidity for the Company s stockholders due to thin trading; and a potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and other third parties who do business with the Company. 

53 

The Company received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq on November 13, 2024 notifying the Company that, since at November 12, 2024, the Company had 417,705 publicly held shares, it no longer meets the minimum 500,000 publicly held shares requirement for The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4) Rule 5550(a)(4) ). The Nasdaq deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Common Stock, and the Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol TRNR at this time. The Company has until November 20, 2024 to present its views with respect to this additional deficiency to the Panel in writing. As of November 13, 2024, the Company has 625,067 publicly held shares and believes this deficiency has been cured. However, if the Company fails regain compliance and/or secure an extension, the Company will be subject to being delisted from the Nasdaq market. If a delisting occurs, the Company will be faced with a number of material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for its common stock; limited news and analyst coverage; decreased ability to obtain additional financing or failure to comply with the covenants required by the Company s borrowing arrangement; limited liquidity for the Company s stockholders due to thin trading; and a potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and other third parties who do business with the Company. 

These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
 C ommitments 
 In May 2021, we entered into two agreements with a third-party content provider Content Provider ), a service agreement and a collaboration agreement. Per the service agreement, Forme is to provide content creation services for the Content Provider in which we are to produce workout content using the Content Provider s trainers and studios. Under the collaboration agreement, both we and the Content Provider agree to jointly market their partnership; in addition, the collaboration agreement provides us with a license to use the Content Provider s content and marks on our Studio fitness ecosystem (i.e., the License ). The license issued to us allows us to reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform the content and the modified content, to market, advertise or promote Forme, perform specified activities, and provide our customers access to and use of the Content Provider s content, throughout the world on our Studio products and in any media, so long as such other media is associated or related to the use of our Studio products. 
 A liability for total minimum commitment (the license fee) on a quarterly basis was recognized as a liability of 2.3 million as of December 31, 2022. In March 2023, both agreements with the Content Provider were terminated by mutual agreement and no payments remain due or payable thereunder and the liability was recognized as a gain on settlement for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In accordance with ASC 718, when a nonrecourse note is used to fund the exercise of a stock option, the stock option is not considered exercised for accounting purposes until the employee repays the loan. Prior to repayment of a nonrecourse loan, the outstanding shares received in exchange for the loan are excluded from the denominator of basic earnings per share. Additionally, the nonrecourse loan itself is not recorded on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet since the arrangement is, in substance, a stock option. 
 In 2022 and 2021, the sale of the shares of common stock to several employees was completed in the form of issuances of Secured Partial Recourse Promissory Notes (the Note(s) by the respective employee to the Company. 
 The Notes were in the aggregate amount of 154,875 and 94,908 shares as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Notes are secured by a pledge of collateral, representing the shares of stock sold. Interest is charged at the mid-term Applicable Federal Rate as of the date of the Note and compounded annually. Per the terms of the Notes, 51 of the initial amounts of the outstanding principal balances plus any accrued and unpaid interest, represent a full recourse note, and 49 of the initial amounts represent a nonrecourse note. The Company analyzed the terms of the Notes and concluded that the recourse portion of the notes are nonrecourse in nature as the Company does not have intention to seek repayment beyond the shares issued despite the recourse legal terms, and thus will be treated the same as the nonrecourse portion of the Notes. All Notes are outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders equity/deficit, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions. The critical accounting policies that reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements include those noted below. 
 Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Form 10-K and in Note 2. to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 2. to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ 
 55 

significantly from those estimates. During the period covered by this Quarterly Report, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed in our Form 10-K other than those disclosed in Note 2. of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill consists of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , which requires an annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets. The Company may first choose to perform a qualitative evaluation of the likelihood of goodwill and intangible assets impairment. For the goodwill that was the result of current year acquisitions, the Company chose to perform a qualitative evaluation. If the Company determined a quantitative evaluation was necessary, the goodwill at the reporting unit was subject to a two-step impairment test. The first step compares the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company completes the second step in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment loss that should be recorded. In the second step, the Company determines an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill. As of September 30, 2024 there was no goodwill impairment. For additional information refer to Note 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. 
 The Company estimates the fair value of intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This methodology assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets. This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates for this category of intellectual property, discount rates and other variables. The Company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. For the periods presented, the Company did not recognize any impairment of intangible assets as the estimated fair value of its intangible assets exceeded the book value of these reporting units. 
 Business Combinations 
 The Company accounts for business combinations under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. ASC 805 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred. If the business combination provides for contingent consideration, the Company records the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date with changes in the fair value recorded through earnings. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the dates of the statement of financial position included in this report. 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 Under Section 107(b) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards would apply to private companies. We have elected this exemption to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Where allowable we have early adopted certain standards as described in Note 2. of our condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this report. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We will continue to remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of the following: (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenue is equal to or more than 1.235 billion; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual 
 56 

Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 To date, all of our inventory purchases have been denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor and supply costs, in other currencies. While we are not currently contractually obligated to pay increased costs due to changes in exchange rates, to the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margins. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from operating expenses is relatively small at this time as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total expenses. To date, we have not entered into derivatives or hedging transactions, as our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has historically been partially hedged as our foreign currency denominated inflows have covered our foreign currency denominated expenses. However, we may enter into derivative or hedging transactions in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or furnish pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, a material weaknesses is identified related to (1) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the expertise to design, implement, and execute a formal risk assessment process and formal accounting policies, procedures, and controls over accounting and financial reporting to ensure the timely and accurate recording of financial transactions while maintaining a segregation of duties; and (2) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the appropriate U.S. GAAP technical expertise to identify, evaluate, and account for complex transactions and review valuation reports prepared by external specialists. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 As of September 30, 2024, management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness described below. 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by a company s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that it is reasonably possible that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 58 

In preparing our financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses we identified related to (1) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the expertise to design, implement, and execute a formal risk assessment process and formal accounting policies, procedures, and controls over accounting and financial reporting to ensure the timely and accurate recording of financial transactions while maintaining a segregation of duties; (2) certain system limitations in our accounting software and the overall control environment (3) the lack of a sufficient number of trained professionals with the appropriate U.S. GAAP technical expertise to identify, evaluate, and account for complex transactions and review valuation reports prepared by external specialists and (4) the lack of sufficient processes and precise review and procedures to ensure the proper accounting for stock based compensation expenses, and the recording of those expenses completely and accurately in the appropriate period. 
 We are planning on implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses, including formalizing our processes and internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our financial management; hiring additional qualified accounting and finance personnel and engaging financial consultants to enable the implementation of internal control over financial reporting and segregating duties amongst accounting and finance personnel. In addition, we are planning on implementing an accounting software system with the design and functionality to segregate incompatible accounting duties, which we currently expect will be fully implemented in our 2024 fiscal year. 
 While we are implementing these measures, we cannot assure you that these efforts will remediate our material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in a timely manner, or at all, or prevent restatements of our financial statements in the future. In particular, our material weakness related to our accounting software was not fully remediated as of September 30, 2024, as we expect to implement new software in 2025. If we are unable to successfully remediate our material weaknesses, or identify any future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports, and the market price of our common stock may decline as a result. 
 In accordance with the provisions of the JOBS Act, we and our independent registered public accounting firm were not required to, and did not, perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, nor any period subsequent in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may still exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after the completion of our initial public offering. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Part II - Other Information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 For information regarding legal proceedings please refer to Note 14. - Commitments and Contingencies in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of current matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Even if any particular litigation or claim is not resolved in a manner that is adverse to our interests, such litigation can have a negative impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources from our business, and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. 
 
 Item 5. O ther Information 
 Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5 1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , no such plans or arrangements were or , including by .
