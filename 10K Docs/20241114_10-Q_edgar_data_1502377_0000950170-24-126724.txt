anticipated future cash calls going forward from the Peak Gold JV as operations commenced in July 2024 which has allowed the Peak Gold JV to operate from the cash flows generated from its operations. Management Committee approved a significant budget to complete the required development to start the operations of the Manh Choh mine, which began production early in the third quarter of 2024 and remains on track to deliver its planned production this year. The entire million of capital calls necessary for the Peak Gold JV to reach production have already been funded by the Company as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has funded million of the 2023 and 2024 capital calls to the Peak Gold JV, of which million was funded from the Facility (as defined below). The Company believes it has sufficient capital to continue production at the Manh Choh mine, with its cash on hand. The Company received its first distribution of million in September 2024 and its second cash distribution of million on October 24, 2024 relating to production at Manh Choh. In total, the Company has received million in cash distributions from the Peak Gold JV since commencing the processing of Manh Choh ore in July 2024. There can be no guarantee that the Peak Gold JV will make future distributions to the Company. The Company believes that distributions are probable and that it will maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital requirements, including repayment obligations of approximately million on the Facility, for the next twelve months from the date of this report. Failure to pay current debt obligations will result in an event of default and the Company's debt would be due immediately or callable (See Note 13). The Company made principal payments towards the Facility of million and million in July 2024 and October 2024, respectively. If there are any unforeseen cash calls and if the Company elects to not fund a portion of its cash calls to the Peak Gold JV, its membership interest in the Peak Gold JV would be diluted. If the Company s interest in the Peak Gold JV is diluted, the Company may not be able to fully realize its investment in the Peak Gold JV. Also, if no additional financing is obtained, the Company may not be able to fully realize its investment in the Contango Properties. The Company has limited financial resources and the ability of the Company to refinance current debt or arrange additional financing in the future will depend, in part, on the prevailing capital market conditions, the results achieved at the Peak Gold JV Property, as well as the market price of metals. The Company cannot be certain that financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms, if at all.

Stock Options. Under the Equity Plans, options granted must have an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The Company may grant key employees both incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and stock options that are not qualified as incentive stock options. Stock option grants to non-employees, such as directors and consultants, may only be stock options that are not qualified as incentive stock options. Options generally expire after . Upon option exercise, the Company s policy is to issue new shares to option holders. The Company applies the fair value method to account for stock option expense. Under this method, cash flows from the exercise of stock options resulting from tax benefits in excess of recognized cumulative compensation cost (excess tax benefits) are classified as financing cash flows. See Note 4 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies from Company's Form 10-KT for the six-month period ended December 31, 2023. All employee stock option grants are expensed over the stock option s vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted. The fair value of each option is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Expected volatilities are based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company s stock with a look-back period equal to the expected term of the options. The expected dividend yield is as the Company has never declared and does not anticipate declaring dividends on its common stock. The expected term of the options granted represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. The simplified method is used to estimate the expected term, due to the lack of historical stock option exercise activity. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury bills with a duration equal to or close to the expected term of the options at the time of grant. There were newly vested stock options for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 or for the nine month period ended September, 2023.

The investor rights agreement contains provisions that require QRC and its affiliates, while they own or more of our outstanding common stock, to standstill, not to participate in any unsolicited or hostile takeover of the Company, not to tender its shares of common stock unless the Company s board recommends such tender, to vote its shares of common stock in the manner recommended by the Company s board to its stockholders, and not to transfer its shares of common stock representing more than of outstanding shares without notifying the Company in advance, whereupon the Company will have a right to purchase those shares. The Debenture carried an original issue discount of million and debt issuance costs of approximately million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unamortized discount and issuance costs were million and million, respectively. The carrying amount of the debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net of the unamortized discount and issuance costs was million and million, respectively. The fair value of the Debenture (Level 2) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million. The Company recognized interest expense totaling million related to this debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (inclusive of approximately million of contractual interest, and approximately million related to the amortization of the discount and issuance fees). The Company recognized interest expense totaling million related to this debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (inclusive of approximately million of contractual interest, and approximately million related to the amortization of the discount and issuance fees). The effective interest rate of the Debenture is the same as the stated interest rate, . The effective interest rate for the amortization of the discount and issuance costs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was and , respectively. The Company reviewed the provisions of the debt agreement to determine if the agreement included any embedded features and concluded that the change of control provisions within the debt agreement met the characteristics of a derivative and required bifurcation and separate accounting. The fair value of the identified derivative was determined to be de minimis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as the probability of a change of control was negligible as of those dates. For each subsequent reporting period, the Company will evaluate each potential derivative feature to conclude whether or not they qualify for derivative accounting. Any derivatives identified will be recorded at the applicable fair value as of the end of each reporting period.

Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company applies the provisions of the fair value measurement standard on a non-recurring basis to its non-financial assets and liabilities, including mineral properties, business combinations, and asset retirement obligations. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments if events or changes in certain circumstances indicate that adjustments may be necessary. 

, the Company entered into a definitive arrangement agreement (the Arrangement Agreement by and among the Company, Contango Mining Canada Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and HighGold Mining Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia HighGold ), pursuant to which the Company acquired of the outstanding equity interests of HighGold (the HighGold Acquisition by way of a court approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The HighGold Acquisition, which was approved by HighGold shareholders at HighGold s special meeting held on June 27, 2024, was subsequently approved by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on July 2, 2024. On July 10, 2024, the Company completed the HighGold Acquisition and, as contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement, each HighGold share of common stock was exchanged for shares of Contango common stock, par value per share (the common stock ). HighGold options were also exchanged, directly or indirectly, for Contango shares of common stock, based on the fair market value of the HighGold options prior to the closing date. Upon closing of the HighGold Acquisition, the Company issued an aggregate of shares of Contango common stock, with a value of million, to HighGold shareholders in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. Such exemption was based on the final order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia issued on July 2, 2024, approving the Acquisition following a hearing by the court which considered, among other things, the fairness of the Acquisition to the persons affected. Upon completion of the

and HighGold shareholders own approximately of the combined company. Avidian Alaska Acquisition On , the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Avidian Gold Corp. Avidian pursuant to which the Company has agreed to purchase Avidian s owned Alaskan subsidiary, Avidian Gold Alaska Inc., for initial consideration of , with a contingent payment for up to (the Avidian Alaska Acquisition ). On , the Company completed the Avidian Alaska Acquisition. The total purchase price of consisted of (i) in cash (the Cash Consideration and (ii) in shares of Contango common stock, with of such shares withheld at closing and to be paid only upon settlement of a withholding contingency (the Equity Consideration ). The Cash Consideration shall be paid in the following tranches: (i) a deposit of (paid), (ii) to be paid upon settlement of a withholding contingency and (iii) of the Cash Consideration to be paid on or before the six-month anniversary of the transaction closing date. The number of shares of common stock constituting the Equity Consideration, which were issued or will be issued in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, was determined based on Contango s 10-day VWAP on the NYSE American immediately prior to the closing date. The Company evaluated these acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. ASC 805 requires that an acquirer determine whether it has acquired a business. If the criteria of ASC 805 are met, a transaction would be accounted for as a business combination and the purchase price is allocated to the respective net assets assumed based on their fair values and a determination is made whether any goodwill results from the transaction. In evaluating the criteria outlined by this standard, the Company concluded that the acquired set of assets did not meet the US GAAP definition of a business (there are several reasons the assets do not constitute a business including the fact that the assembled workforce does not currently perform a substantive process). Therefore, the Company accounted for both purchases as an asset acquisition. With regards to the HighGold acquisition, the Company allocated the total consideration transferred on the date of the acquisition, approximately million, to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis. The total consideration transferred was comprised of million in shares and million in direct transactions costs. With regards to the Avidian Alaska acquisition, the Company allocated the total consideration transferred on the date of the acquisition, approximately million, to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis. The total consideration was comprised of million in scheduled cash payments, and million in shares. The Avidian Alaska acquisition included a payable contingent upon the Company achieving a decision to proceed with commercial production within 120 months of the closing date. Given that the Company is still in the early exploration stage of the Avidian claims and has no current plans or data that would support the development of a mine, it cannot reasonably conclude that reaching commercial production is probable. As such, liability will be recognized for the deferred consideration. If circumstances change within the 120-month period outlined by the Avidian stock purchase agreement and commercial production is deemed probable, management will recognize the deferred consideration with a corresponding increase to the related mineral property. As such, the Company will t recognize any amount for the deferred consideration portion in the acquisition of Avidian. That is, because a liability cannot be recognized in accordance with ASC 450, the fair value is .

 25 

Table of Contents 

Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities ("DOT"). The Complaint seeks injunctive relief against the DOT with respect to its oversight of Peak Gold's ore haul plan. The Complaint alleges that the DOT has approved a haul route and trucking plan that violates DOT regulations, DOT's actions have created an unreasonable risk to public safety constituting an attractive public nuisance, and DOT has aided and abetted the offense of negligent driving. On November 2, 2023, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the DOT and sought expedited consideration of its motion. If granted, the motion could impact Peak Gold's ore haul plans. On November 9, 2023, the Court denied the plaintiff's motion for expedited consideration. On November 15, 2023, the Court granted Peak Gold, LLC's motion to intervene. On January 15, 2024, Peak Gold and DOT jointly moved for judgment on the pleadings and to stay all discovery. On May 14, 2024, the Court issued an Order denying the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and staying discovery. On June 24, 2024, the Court issued an Order granting judgment on the pleadings as to three of the four claims for relief alleged in the Complaint and denying relief as to the claim for public nuisance. The Order further lifted the stay of discovery. On July 3, 2024, the DOT filed motion for reconsideration as to the Court's Order on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Peak Gold joined. On September 13, 2024, the Court entered an Order denying this motion. The case is set for trial on August 11, 2025. 
 Dot Lake Complaint 
 On July 1, 2024, the Village of Dot Lake, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, located approximately 50 miles from the Manh Choh mine on the ore haul route along the Alaska Highway ("Dot Lake"), filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska against U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the "Corps") and Lt. General Scott A. Spellmon, in his official capacity as Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the Corps. The Complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief based on the Corps' alleged failure to consult with Dot Lake and to undertake an adequate environmental review with respect to the Corps' issuance in September 2022 of a wetlands disturbance permit in connection with the overall permitting of the Manh Choh mine as to approximately 5 acres of wetlands located on Tetlin Village land. Peak Gold is not named as a defendant in the Complaint and, on August 20, 2024, Peak Gold moved to intervene in the action, which Dot Lake has opposed. On October 10, 2024, the Court granted intervention to Peak Gold. 
 Strategy 
 Partnering with strategic industry participants to expand future exploration work. As of October 1, 2020, in conjunction with the Kinross transactions that established the current ownership interests in the Peak Gold JV and the signing of the A R JV LLCA, KG Mining became the manager of the Peak Gold JV (the Manager ). KG Mining may resign as Manager and can be removed as Manager for a material breach of the A R JV LLCA, a material failure to perform its obligations as the Manager, a failure to conduct the Peak Gold JV operations in accordance with industry standards and applicable laws, and other limited circumstances. Except as expressly delegated to the Manager, the A R JV LLCA provides that the JV Management Committee has exclusive authority to determine all management matters related to the Company. The JV Management Committee currently consists of one appointee designated by the Company and two appointees designated by KG Mining. The Representatives designated by each member of the Peak Gold JV vote as a group, and in accordance with their respective membership interests in the Peak Gold JV. Except in the case of certain actions that require approval by unanimous vote of the Representatives, the affirmative vote of a majority of the membership interests in the Peak Gold JV constitutes the action of the JV Management Committee. 
 Structuring Incentives to Drive Behavior . The Company believes that equity ownership aligns the interests of the Company s executives and directors with those of its stockholders. The Company has implemented an equity compensation program for its executive officers and directors (and other persons) that provides an incentive for such officers to achieve the Company s long-term business objectives. The Company s equity compensation program includes two forms of long-term incentives: restricted stock and stock options. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s directors and executives beneficially own approximately 13.7 of the Company s common stock. 
 Acquiring exploration properties . The Company anticipates from time to time acquiring additional properties in Alaska for exploration, subject to the availability of funds. The acquisitions may include leases or similar rights from Alaska Native corporations and/or staking Federal or State of Alaska mining claims. Acquiring additional properties will likely result in additional expense to the Company for minimum royalties, minimum rents and annual exploratory work requirements. The Company is open to strategic partnerships or alliances with other companies as a means to enhance its ability to fund new and existing exploration and development opportunities. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 None. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company has identified below the critical accounting estimate that is of particular 
 26 

Table of Contents 

importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Contingent Considerations. Contingent consideration in asset acquisitions payable in the form of cash is recognized when payment becomes probable and reasonably estimable, unless the contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative, in which case the amount becomes part of the asset acquisition cost when acquired. Contingent consideration payable in the form of a fixed number of the Company s own shares is measured at fair value as of the acquisition date and recognized when the issuance of the shares becomes probable. Upon recognition of the contingent consideration payment, the amount is included in the cost of the acquired asset or group of assets. The Company carries a liability for contingent consideration related to the acquisition of LSA. In estimating the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period, the Company makes estimates regarding the probability and timing of reaching the milestones associated with payment of the consideration, as well as the weighted average cost of capital used to discount the liability to its present value as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in any one of these estimates. 
 Derivative Instruments. The Company utilizes derivative instruments in order to manage exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities, measured at fair value, and recognizes changes in the fair value of derivatives in current earnings. The Company has elected to not designate any of its positions under the hedge accounting rules. Accordingly, these derivative contracts are mark-to-market and any changes in the estimated values of derivative contracts held at the balance sheet date are recognized in unrealized (loss) gain on derivative contracts, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts. Realized gains or losses on derivative contracts will be recognized in (Loss) gain on derivative contracts, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The loss also included a non-cash unrealized loss of 22.9 million. The Company did not deliver gold ounces into the derivative contracts for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Therefore, there was no realized loss for the period and the 2.7 million was a

non-cash unrealized loss. The Company did not enter into any derivative contracts until July 2023 (see Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities). 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Claim Rentals Expense. Claim rental expense primarily consists of State of Alaska rental payments and costs incurred to record annual labor documents. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, claim rental expense was 0.4 million and 0.4 million respectively. 
 Exploration Expense. Exploration expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.1 million compared to 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Current period exploration expense primarily relates to a 3,000 meter surface drill program at the Johnson Tract Project. The prior period exploration expense relates to care and maintenance work performed on our Lucky Shot Property. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7.3 million and 7.3 million, respectively. The Company s general and administrative expense primarily relates to legal fees, regulatory fees, payroll and stock-based compensation expense. 
 Income / Loss from Equity Investment in the Peak Gold JV . The income from the Company s equity investment in the Peak Gold JV for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.7 million compared to a loss of 17.4 million for the same period in 2023. The Manh Choh project commenced production in July 2024, which generated income for the 2024 period. The capital contributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 31.2 million and 38.8 million, respectively. The capital contributions were higher for nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to September 30, 2024 as operations were ramping up at the Manh Choh project with ore and waste mining and a focus on capital improvements at the Fort Knox mill facility. The Peak Gold JV issued a cash distribution of 19.5 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. No cash distributions were made for the same period in 2023. There were no suspended losses as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 interest expense was 8.6 million related to the Debenture and interest expense related to the Company s cumulative 58.0 million draw-down on the Facility. Prior year interest expense of 1.9 million included interest expense related to the Debenture and interest expense related to the Company's cumulative 20 million draw-down on the Facility. See Note 13 - Debt. 
 Metal Sales. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the gain on metal sales was 0.9 million related to excess ounces that were purchased from the Peak Gold JV that were not delivered into the hedges and sold to the derivative counterparties. There were no metal sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Loss on Derivative Contracts. Loss on derivative contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 57.0 million compared to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 57.0 million loss for the nine month period of September 30, 2024 included a realized loss of 5.9 million as the Company delivered 14,826 gold ounces into the derivative contracts. The loss also included a non-cash unrealized loss of 51.1 million. The Company did not deliver gold ounces into the derivative contracts for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Therefore, there was no realized loss for the period and the 2.7 million was a non-cash unrealized loss. The Company did not enter into any derivative contracts until July 2023 (see Note 14 - Derivative and Hedging Activities). 
 Cash Cost on a By-Product Basis (non-GAAP Measure) 
 The table below presents a reconciliation between the most comparable GAAP measure of total cost of sales to the non-GAAP measures of Cash Cost on a By-product Basis for the Peak Gold JV operations (Manh Choh) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There are no comparables provided as sales of gold at Manh Choh commenced in July 2024. 
 Cash Cost on a By-product Basis, per Ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute and the World Gold Council) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that this non-GAAP measure as we report is the same as that reported by other mining companies. 
 Cash Cost on a By-product Basis includes all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing gold, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. The value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production, i.e. a by-product. 
 Cash Cost on a By-product Basis, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that the Company will utilize to measure a mine's operating performance. Cash Cost on a By-product Basis, per Ounce allows us to benchmark the performance of the Peak Gold JV versus those of our competitors. This statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 36.2 million of cash. 
 The Company s primary cash requirements have been for general and administrative expenses, capital calls from the Peak Gold JV for the Manh Choh Property, repayment of interest related to debt and exploration expenditures on the Johnson Tract Project and Lucky Shot Property. The Company s sources of cash have been from common stock offerings, the issuance of the Debenture, distributions from the equity investment and the proceeds from the Facility (see Note 8 - Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) and Note 13 - Debt, for a discussion of the recent activity). 
 The JV Management Committee approved a significant budget to complete the required development to start the operations of the Manh Choh mine, which began production early in the third quarter of 2024 and remains on track to deliver its planned production this year. On July 8, 2024, the Peak Gold JV poured its first gold bar. The ore mining continues along with stockpiling ore at the Fort Knox facility. The Project is on schedule and full commissioning of the modifications at the Fort Knox mill was completed. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has funded 78.6 million of the fiscal 2023 and 2024 capital calls to the Peak Gold JV, 31.3 million of which was required in fiscal 2024 for the Peak Gold JV to reach production. 60.0 million of such amount was funded from the Facility. Operations commenced in July 2024 which has allowed the Peak Gold JV to operate from the cash flows generated from its operations and there are no future anticipated cash calls. If there are any unforeseen cash calls and if the Company elects to not fund a portion of its cashl calls to the Peak Gold JV, its membership interest in the Peak Gold JV would be diluted. 
 The Company s cash needs going forward will primarily relate to exploration of the Contango Properties, repayment of debt and related interest and general and administrative expenses of the Company. Although there can be no guarantee that the Peak Gold JV will make distributions to the Company, the Company believes that distributions are probable and that it will maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital requirements, including repayment obligations of approximately 34.9 million on the Facility, for the next twelve months from the date of this report. Failure to pay current debt obligations will result in an event of default and the Company's debt would be due immediately or callable (See Note 13). 
 Further financing by the Company may include issuances of equity, instruments convertible into equity (such as warrants) or various forms of debt. The Company has issued common stock and other instruments convertible into equity in the past and cannot predict the size or price of any future issuances of common stock or other instruments convertible into equity, and the effect, if any, that such future issuances and sales will have on the market price of the Company s securities. Any additional issuances of common stock or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, common stock may ultimately result in dilution to the holders of common stock, dilution in any future earnings per share of the Company and may have a material adverse effect upon the market price of the common stock of the Company.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is a 30 owner of the Peak Gold JV, which operates the Manh Choh mine near Tok, Alaska. Ore from the mine is being trucked to the Fort Knox mill for processing via public roadways in state-of-the-art trucks carrying legal loads. Certain owners of vacation homes along the ore haul route and others claiming potential impact have organized a group to oppose the ore haul plan and disrupt the project. These efforts have included administrative appeals of certain state mine permits unrelated to ore haul. To date, those appeals have been unsuccessful. 
 On October 20, 2023, the Committee for Safe Communities, an Alaskan non-profit corporation inclusive of this same group of objectors and formed for the purpose of opposing the project, filed suit in the Superior Court in Fairbanks, Alaska against the State of Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities ("DOT"). The Complaint seeks injunctive relief against the DOT with respect to its oversight of Peak Gold's ore haul plan. The Complaint alleges that the DOT has approved a haul route and trucking plan that violates DOT regulations, DOT's actions have created an unreasonable risk to public safety constituting an attractive public nuisance, and DOT has aided and abetted the offense of negligent driving. On November 2, 2023, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the DOT and sought expedited consideration of its motion. If granted, the motion could impact Peak Gold's ore haul plans. On November 9, 2023, the Court denied the plaintiff's motion for expedited consideration. On November 15, 2023, the Court granted Peak Gold, LLC's motion to intervene. On January 15, 2024, Peak Gold and DOT jointly moved for judgment on the pleadings and to stay all discovery. On May 14, 2024, the Court issued an Order denying the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and staying discovery. On June 24, 2024, the Court issued an Order granting judgment on the pleadings as to three of the four claims for relief alleged in the Complaint and denying relief as to the claim for public nuisance. The Order further lifted the stay of discovery. On July 3, 2024, the DOT filed motion for reconsideration as to the Court's Order on the motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Peak Gold joined. On September 13, 2024, the Court entered an Order denying this motion. The case is set for trial on August 11, 2025. 
 On July 1, 2024, the Village of Dot Lake, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, located approximately 50 miles from the Manh Choh mine on the ore haul route along the Alaska Highway ("Dot Lake"), filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska against U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the "Corps") and Lt. General Scott A. Spellmon, in his official capacity as Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the Corps. The Complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief based on the Corps' alleged failure to consult with Dot Lake and to undertake an adequate environmental review with respect to the Corps' issuance in September 2022 of a wetlands disturbance permit in connection with the overall permitting of the Manh Choh mine as to approximately 5 acres of wetlands located on Tetlin Village land. Peak Gold is not named as a defendant in the Complaint and, on August 20, 2024, Peak Gold moved to intervene in the action, which Dot Lake has opposed. On October 10, 2024, the Court granted intervention to Peak Gold. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the risk factor set forth below and the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the six-month period ended December 31 , 2023 , under the headings Item 1. Business Adverse Climate Conditions, Competition, Government Regulation and Item 2. Properties Environmental Regulation and Permitting, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the six-month period ended December 31 , 2023 . The risks described in our Transition Report on Form 10-KT for the six-month period ended December 31 , 2023 are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. An investment in the Company is subject to risks inherent in our business and involves a high degree of risk. The trading price of the shares of the Company is affected 
 30 

Table of Contents 

by the performance of our business relative to, among other things, competition, market conditions and general economic and industry conditions. The value of an investment in the Company may decrease, resulting in a loss. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On August 6, 2024, in connection with the Avidian Alaska Acquisition, the Company issued 78,511 shares of its common stock to Avidian. The shares, the amount of which was determined based on Contango s 10-day VWAP on the NYSE American immediately prior to the closing date, were issued in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, registrants that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose specified information about mine health and safety in their periodic reports. These reporting requirements are based on the safety and health requirements applicable to mines under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor s Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA ). 
 The Company does not serve as the manager of the Peak Gold JV or operator of the Manh Choh mine, and all of its other projects are in the exploration stage. Accordingly, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company and its properties or operations were not subject to regulation by MSHA under the Mine Act and, thus, no disclosure is required under Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act or subpart 104 of Regulation S-K. 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 , , a of the Company, a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K intended to satisfy Rule 10b5-1(c) to sell up to shares of our common stock between 22.50 and 29.95 subject to the terms and conditions of such arrangement. Other than as disclosed above, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
