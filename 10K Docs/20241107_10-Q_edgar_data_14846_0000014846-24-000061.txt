 Per Share Data 
 Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income applicable to common stockholders for the applicable period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during such period. Net income is also allocated to the unvested restricted stock outstanding during each period, as the restricted stock is entitled to receive dividends and is therefore considered a participating security. The RSUs are excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation as they are not participating securities. 
 Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into shares of common stock or resulted in the issuance of shares of common stock that share in the earnings of the Company. Diluted earnings per share is determined by dividing net income applicable to common stockholders for the applicable period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock deemed to be outstanding during such period. 
 In calculating diluted earnings per share, the Company includes only those shares underlying the RSUs that it anticipates

Overview 
 We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT, that owns, operates and, to a lesser extent, holds interests in joint ventures that own and operate multi-family properties. At September 30, 2024, we: (i) wholly-own 21 multi-family properties with an aggregate of 5,420 units and a carrying value of 619.5 million; (ii) have ownership interests, through unconsolidated entities, in eight multi-family properties with 2,527 units and a carrying value of 31.6 million; and (iii) own other assets, through consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, with a carrying value of 1.9 million. The 29 multi-family properties are located in 11 states; most of these properties are located in the Southeast United States and Texas. See "- Recent Transactions ".

 Challenges and Uncertainties as a Result of the Uncertain Economic Environment; Pursuit of Joint Venture Acquisition and Alternative Investment Opportunities 
 
 As more fully described (i) in our Annual Report, and in particular, the sections thereof entitled " Risk Factors " and " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and (ii) below, we face challenges e.g ., inflation, volatile interest rates and rental rates decreases) due to the uncertain economic environment, which may limit our ability or willingness (i) to acquire properties, (ii) grow rental income or (iii) control our real estate operating expenses, some of which, such as real estate tax and insurance expense, we have a very limited ability to control. In addition, several properties, (in particular, Bells Bluff and Avondale Station), face increasing competition due to additional supply in such markets which have and may continue to adversely impact rental rates and occupancy rates. 
 
 In light of the challenging acquisition environment and the limited funds available to us to acquire properties, we are pursuing (i) alternative investments in the multi-family property arena, including preferred equity investments e.g., an investment entitling us to a fixed rate of return prior to distributions to more junior investors) or bridge loans e.g. , a loan secured by a first mortgage on the subject property) and/or (ii) the acquisition of multi-family properties through joint ventures. We do not anticipate that in the near term, these type of investments (other than joint ventures already included in our portfolio), will constitute a significant part of our portfolio, and can provide no assurance that such investments will be profitable for us. See "- Recent Transactions ". 
 
 Credit facility 
 
 On July 9, 2024, we and an affiliate of Valley National Bank ("VNB"), amended our credit facility to, among other things, reduce the borrowing capacity from 60 million to 40 million, extend the facility's maturity from September 2025 to September 2027 and revise certain financial and other covenants. In connection with this amendment we paid the lender aggregate fees of 323,000. 
 
 Mortgage Financing 
 
 On August 22, 2024, we obtained a 27.4 million mortgage on our Woodland Trails - LA Grange, GA property (the"Woodland Financing"). The debt matures in September 2031, bears a fixed rate of interest of 5.22 and is interest only until maturity. As a result of the Woodland Financing, we will incur additional interest expense of approximately 1.5 million per year. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we used approximately 18.3 million of the proceeds from the Woodland Financing to complete a transaction described under "-Recent Transaction" and anticipate using the balance of such proceeds for future transactions and general corporate purposes (which may include repurchases of our common stock). 
 
 Bells Bluff-West Nashville, Tennessee 
 
 This property Bells Bluff has experienced, and continues to experience, competitive pressure due to the completion of construction of similar or higher-quality multi-family properties in Nashville. To maintain occupancy levels, we have offered, and anticipate that we will continue to offer, short-term rent concessions and/or reduced rental rates. As a result, Bells Bluff's operating results have been adversely impacted. Although the rent concessions we are currently offering are less significant than those offered during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we continue to offer such concessions and reduced rental rates. We believe that due, among other things, to its vibrant economy, that over-time, the Nashville market will absorb the excess rental capacity, although we can provide no assurance in this regard. 
 
 Recent Transactions 
 Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2024 we : 
 sold a cooperative apartment unit in New York, NY for a sale price of approximately 1.1 million and we anticipate that we will recognize a gain of approximately 806,000 in the quarter ending December 31, 2024; 
 
 provided an aggregate of 18.3 million to joint ventures that purchased a 204-unit multi-family property in Wilmington, North Carolina and a 184-unit multi family property in Kennesaw, Georgia - generally the transaction documents provide for (1) an annual return to us of 13.0 compounded monthly (of which 6.0 to 6.5 is payable monthly to the extent of available cash-flow and with the balance of 6.5 to 7.0 also to be paid monthly from any remaining cash flow after sponsor's receipt of a specified return) and (2) the total amount provided, including all accrued return, in any event to be payable to us from 2029 to 2031.

Results of Operations 
 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 As used herein, the term "same store properties" refers to operating properties that were wholly owned for the entirety of the periods presented. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all of the properties in our consolidated portfolio are same store properties. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 The following table compares our revenues for the periods indicated: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands): 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Rental and other revenue from real estate properties 24,177 23,510 667 2.8 Interest and other income 219 342 (123) (36.0) Total revenues 24,396 23,852 544 2.3 

Rental and other revenue from real estate properties 
 
 The change was primarily due to: 
 
 539,000 in the net deferral of rent concessions, primarily at Bells Bluff; and 
 159,000 net increase in rental rates across several properties in the portfolio. 
 
 Interest and other income 
 
 Interest and other income decreased primarily due to the receipt, in the corresponding period of 2023, of the Employee Retention Tax Credit, and reduced interest income on invested balances. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 The following table compares our expenses for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Real estate operating expenses 11,187 10,583 604 5.7 Interest expense 5,745 5,581 164 2.9 General and administrative 3,811 4,017 (206) (5.1) Depreciation and amortization 6,499 6,544 (45) (0.7) Total expenses 27,242 26,725 517 1.9 
 
 Real estate operating expense. 
 
 The change is due primarily to increases of (i) 216,000 due to increased real estate tax accruals (including a 121,000 increase at Newbridge Commons - Columbus, OH) - we anticipate that through the balance of 2024, these accruals will be similarly higher than such accruals in 2023, (ii) 155,000 in insurance premiums at two properties which were not covered by our master insurance policy, (iii) 145,000 primarily to replace and upgrade HVAC units at Crestmont at Thornblade - Greenville, SC and Kilburn Crossings - Fredricksburg, VA, and (iv) 123,000 in utility expenses across several of our properties. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense increased primarily due to the Woodland Financing. 

21 

Table of Content 

 General and administrative 
 
 The change is due primarily to a 347,000 reduction in amortization associated with restricted stock units ("RSUs") that vest upon the achievement of specified levels of adjusted funds from operations - we do not currently anticipate achieving the minimum performance level that would result in the vesting of such RSUs. 
 
 Insurance recovery of casualty loss 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, we received 261,000 in insurance proceeds as reimbursement for expenses incurred related to a winter storm in December 2022. There was no similar recovery in the corresponding period in 2024. 
 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 
 During the quarter ended September 2023, we sold a cooperative apartment in New York for a sales price of 785,000 and recognized a gain of 604,000 on the sale. There was no similar gain in the corresponding period in 2024. 
 
 Income tax (benefit) provision 
 
 Income tax (benefit) provision for the three months ended ended September 30, 2024, decreased 188,000 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to our recognition, in the current three months, of a 374,000 franchise tax refund from a property due to a change in Tennessee law. The three months ended September 30, 2023 includes a 169,000 reversal of an over-accrual of tax expense.

 Results of Operations 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 As used herein, the term "same store properties" refers to operating properties that were wholly owned for the entirety of the periods presented. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all of our properties in our consolidated portfolio are same store properties. 
 
 Revenues 
 
 The following table compares our revenues for the periods indicated: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands): 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Rental and other revenue from real estate properties 71,253 69,704 1,549 2.2 Other income 408 405 3 0.7 Total revenues 71,661 70,109 1,552 2.2 
 
 Rental and other revenue from real estate properties 
 
 The change was due to : 
 
 a 952,000 net increase in the deferrals of rent concessions, primarily at Bells Bluff and, 
 a 780,000 increase in rental rates at a majority of the properties in the portfolio. 
 
 The increase was offset by a 268,000 decrease due to a decline in average occupancy at several properties. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 The following table compares our expenses for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Real estate operating expenses 32,612 31,565 1,047 3.3 Interest expense 16,768 16,577 191 1.2 General and administrative 11,776 11,920 (144) (1.2) Depreciation and amortization 19,400 22,095 (2,695) (12.2) Total expenses 80,556 82,157 (1,601) (1.9) 
 
 Real estate operating expense 
 
 The change is due primarily to increases of (i) 533,000 in insurance premiums at two properties which are not covered by our master insurance policy; (ii) 502,000 in real estate tax accruals, primarily at Newbridge Commons; (iii) 194,000 primarily to replace HVAC units at Kilburn Crossing - Fredricksburg, VA; and (iv) 167,000 in utility expenses at several properties. 
 
 The increase was offset by 276,000 decrease in repairs and maintenance across several properties and the inclusion, in the corresponding 2023 period, of 116,000 of expense related to the December 2022 blizzard. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 The change is due primarily to the additional 210,000 related to the Woodlands Financing and 147,000 due to the increase on the interest rate on our junior subordinated notes. The increase was offset by a 166,000 decrease in interest expense on our credit facility as no amounts have been outstanding in 2024. 

23 

Table of Content 

General and administrative 
 
 The change is due primarily to a 527,000 decrease related to reduced amortization associated with RSUs that vest upon the achievement of specified levels of adjusted funds from operations as we do not currently anticipate achieving the minimum performance level that would result in the vesting of such RSUs. The decrease was offset by a 201,000 increase primarily due to higher cash compensation levels. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 The change is due primarily to the decrease in depreciation related to lease intangibles from properties where we purchased our partners' interests in 2022. 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
 
 Equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures declined to 986,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline is due to: 
 
 534,000 representing our proportionate share of the net loss from Stono Oaks - Johns Island, SC ("Stono Oaks") which was in development through 2023, but which was placed in service in 2024 - as of September 30, 2024, it is approximately 57 leased. Accordingly, interest and certain other expenses (which prior to 2024 were capitalized) and depreciation, are now being expensed; and 
 
 the inclusion, in the corresponding period in 2023, of 399,000 of income, representing our proportionate share of the net income, from Chatham Court and Reflections which was sold in May 2023 (the "Chatham Sale"). 
 
 The decrease was offset primarily by the inclusion, in the corresponding period in 2023, of 212,000 early extinguishment of debt charge, which represented our proportionate share of such change, related to the Chatham Sale. 
 
 Equity in earnings from sale of unconsolidated joint venture properties 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of 14.7 million from the Chatham Sale. There was no comparable gain in the corresponding period in 2024. 
 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 
 In the nine months ended September 2023, we sold a cooperative apartment in New York for a sales price of 785,000 and recognized a gain of 604,000 on the sale. There was no similar gain in the corresponding period in 2024. 
 
 Insurance recovery of casualty loss 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received 476,000 in insurance proceeds as reimbursement for expenses incurred related to a winter storm in December 2022. 
 
 Gain on insurance recoveries 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received a 240,000 payment, representing the final payment made by the insurance carrier with respect to damage we sustained at The Woodland Apartments - Boerne, TX in 2021. 
 
 Income tax (benefit) provision 
 
 Income tax (benefit) provision in the nine months ended ended September 30, 2024, decreased 302,000 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to our recognition, in the current nine month period, of a 534,000 franchise tax refund due to a change in Tennessee law and 169,000 is due primarily to the reversal of the over-accrual of taxes in the prior year.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We require funds to pay operating expenses and debt service obligations, acquire and/or invest in properties (including alternative investments), make capital and other improvements, fund capital contributions, and pay dividends. Generally, our primary sources of capital and liquidity are the operations of our multi-family properties (including distributions from the operations of the unconsolidated multi-family properties), mortgage debt financings and re-financings, the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to our at-the-market distribution and dividend reinvestment programs, borrowings from our credit facility and our available cash. At November 6, 2024, our available liquidity was 67.5 million, including 27.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and 40 million available under our credit facility. 
 
 We anticipate that from October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2027, our operating expenses, 107.1 million of mortgage amortization and interest expense (including 40.5 million from unconsolidated joint ventures), 15.4 million, 130.3 million and 65.9 million of balloon payments with respect to mortgages maturing in 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively (including 60.8 and 23.1 million maturing in 2026 and 2027, respectively, from unconsolidated joint ventures), interest expense on our junior subordinated notes, estimated cash dividend payments of at least 61.0 million (assuming (i) the current quarterly dividend rate of 0.25 per share and (ii) 18.8 million shares outstanding), will be funded from cash generated from operations (including distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures), Our operating cash flow and available cash is insufficient to fully fund the 145.7 million of balloon payments due through 2026, and if we are unable to refinance such debt on acceptable terms, we may need to issue additional equity or dispose of properties, in each case on potentially unfavorable terms. 
 
 Our ability to acquire or invest in additional multi-family property opportunities and implement value-add projects is limited by our available cash and our ability to (i) draw on our credit facility, (ii) obtain, on acceptable terms, mortgage debt from lenders, and (iii) raise capital from the sale of our common stock. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had mortgage debt of 705.2 million (including 252.8 million of mortgage debt at of our unconsolidated subsidiaries). The mortgage debt at our: (i) consolidated properties had a weighted average interest rate of 4.09 and a weighted average remaining term to maturity of approximately 6.3 years, and (ii) at our unconsolidated subsidiaries had a weighted average interest rate of 4.41 and a remaining term to maturity of approximately 4.1 years. 
 
 Junior Subordinated Notes 
 As of September 30, 2024, 37.4 million (excluding deferred costs of 242,000) in principal amount of our junior subordinated notes is outstanding. These notes mature in April 2036, contain limited covenants (including covenants prohibiting us from paying dividends or repurchasing capital stock if there is an event of default (as defined therein) on these notes), are redeemable at our option and bear an interest rate, which resets and is payable quarterly, at a rate of three-month term SOFR plus 250 basis points. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the interest rate on these notes was 7.52 and 7.63 , respectively. 
 Credit Facility 
 Our credit facility with VNB New York, LLC, an affiliate of Valley National Bank (collectively, "VNB"), as amended in July 2024, allows us to borrow, subject to compliance with borrowing base requirements and other conditions, up to 40 million, (i) for the acquisition of, and investment in, multi-family properties, (ii) to repay mortgage debt secured by multi-family properties and (iii) for Operating Expenses i.e. , working capital (including dividend payments) and operating expenses); provided, that not more than 25 million may be used for Operating Expenses. The credit facility is secured by cash accounts maintained by us at VNB (and we are required to maintain substantially all of our bank accounts at VNB), and the pledge of our interests in the entities that own the unencumbered multi-family properties used in calculating the borrowing base. The credit facility bears an annual interest rate, which resets month4ly, equal to one-month term SOFR plus 250 basis points, with a floor of 6.00 . There is an annual fee of 0.25 on the total amount committed by VNB and unused by us. The credit facility matures in September 2027. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of our properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding on the facility. As of November 1, 2024, there was no outstanding balance on the credit facility and 40 million is available to be borrowed thereunder. 
 The terms of the credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants which, among other things, limit the incurrence of liens, require that we maintain and include in the collateral securing the facility at least two unencumbered properties with an aggregate value(as calculated pursuant to the facility) of at least 50 million, and require compliance with financial ratios relating to, among other things, maintaining a minimum tangible net worth of 140 million, the minimum amount of debt service coverage with respect to the properties (and amounts drawn on the credit facility) used in calculating the borrowing base. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of wholly-owned properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the facility.

 Other Financing Sources and Arrangements 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we are joint venture partners in unconsolidated joint ventures which own eight multi-family properties and the distributions to us from these joint venture properties of 971,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 contributed to our liquidity and cash flow. Further, we may be required to make significant capital contributions with respect to these properties. At September 30, 2024, our investments in these joint venture properties had a net-equity carrying value of 31.6 million. The underlying properties are subject to mortgage debt, which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, of 252.8 million. Although BRT Apartments Corp. is not the obligor with respect to such mortgage debt, the loss of any of these properties due to mortgage foreclosure or similar proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Cash Distribution Policy 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute to our stockholders within the time frames prescribed by the Code at least 90 of our ordinary taxable income. Management currently intends to maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate Federal income tax on taxable income we distribute to stockholders in accordance with the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to Federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent tax years. Even if we qualify for Federal taxation as a REIT, we are subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to Federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income i.e ., taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the Code). 
 
 On October 2, 2024, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.25 per share to holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on September 24, 2024. 
 
 We anticipate that the dividends declared in 2024 will be treated as a return of capital for Federal income tax purposes. 
 
 We carefully monitor our discretionary spending. Our largest recurring discretionary expenditure has been our quarterly dividend (which was 0.25 per share of common stock, or in the approximate amount of 4.7 million, for the most recent quarter). Each quarter, our board of directors evaluates the timing and amount of our dividend based on its assessment of, among other things, our short and long- term cash and liquidity requirements, prospects, debt maturities, projections of our REIT taxable income, net income, funds from operations, and adjusted funds from operations. 
 
 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 A complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our Annual Report. There have been no changes in such estimates.

Table of Contents 

 Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations and Net Operating Income 
 
 We disclose below funds from operations FFO ), adjusted funds from operations AFFO and net operating income ("NOI") because we believe that such metrics are a widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the White Paper on Funds From Operations issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT and NAREIT s related guidance. FFO is defined in the White Paper as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities where the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. In computing FFO, we do not add back to net income the amortization of costs in connection with our financing activities or depreciation of non-real estate assets. 
 
 We compute AFFO by adjusting FFO for the loss of extinguishment of debt, our straight-line rent and rental concession accruals, restricted stock and RSU compensation expense, fair value adjustment of mortgage debt, gain on insurance recovery, insurance recovery from casualty loss and deferred mortgage and debt costs including, in each case as applicable, from our share from our unconsolidated joint ventures). Since the NAREIT White Paper only provides guidelines for computing FFO, the computation of AFFO may vary from one REIT to another. 
 
 We believe that FFO and AFFO are useful and standard supplemental measures of the operating performance for equity REITs and are used frequently by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating equity REITs, many of which present FFO and AFFO when reporting their operating results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the carrying value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen and fallen with market conditions. As a result, we believe that FFO and AFFO provide a performance measure that when compared year over year, should reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not be necessarily apparent from net income. We also consider FFO and AFFO to be useful to us in evaluating potential property acquisitions. 
 FFO and AFFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. FFO and AFFO should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a reliable measure of our operating performance; nor should FFO and AFFO be considered an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as defined by GAAP) as measures of liquidity. FFO and AFFO do not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs, including principal amortization and capital improvements. FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities as defined by GAAP. 
 Management recognizes that there are limitations in the use of FFO and AFFO. In evaluating our performance, management is careful to examine GAAP measures such as net income and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 FFO for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the corresponding quarter in the prior year primarily due to (i) an increase in real estate operating expenses, (ii) a decrease in insurance recovery of casualty loss and (iii) an increase in interest expense. This decrease was offset primarily due to (i) the increase in deferred rent concessions adjustments and (ii) a decrease in RSU expense. 
 AFFO for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the corresponding period in the prior year due to the factors contributing to the decrease in FFO other than the increase in deferred rent concession adjustments and the decrease in RSU expense.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to (i) an increase in real estate operating expenses, (ii) a decline in rental revenue primarily due to the Chatham Sale, (iii) a decrease in insurance recovery of casualty loss and (iv) an increase in cash compensation expense. This decrease was offset primarily due to (i) an increase in deferred rent concessions and straight line rent adjustments,(ii) a decrease in RSU expense and (iii) a decrease in income tax expense. 
 
 AFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the corresponding period in the prior year due to the factors contributing to the decrease in FFO other than the increase in deferred rent concessions and straight line rent adjustments and the decrease in RSU expense. 
 
 Diluted per share FFO and AFFO were favorably impacted by a 336,000 net decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding period in the prior year in the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, primarily due to stock buybacks. 
 See "- Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 ", for a discussion of these changes. 
 
 Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP measure of performance. NOI is used by our management and many investors to evaluate and compare the performance of our properties to other comparable properties, to determine trends at our properties and to determine the estimated fair value of our properties. The usefulness of NOI may be limited in that it does not take into account, among other things, general and administrative expense, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, casualty losses, insurance recoveries and gains or losses as determined by GAAP. NOI is a property specific performance metric and does not measure our performance as a whole. 
 
 We compute NOI, by adjusting net (loss) income to (a) add back (1) depreciation expense, (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) interest expense, (4) loss on extinguishment of debt, (5) equity in earnings (loss) from sale of unconsolidated joint venture properties, (6) provision for taxes, and (7) the impact of non-controlling interests, and (b) deduct (1) other income, (2) gain on sale of real estate, (3) insurance recovery of casualty loss, and (4) gain on insurance recoveries related to casualty loss. Other REIT s may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REIT s. We believe NOI provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income (loss). NOI is one of the measures we use to evaluate our performance because it (i) measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items unrelated to property operating performance and (ii) captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders as computed in accordance with GAAP to NOI of our consolidated properties for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, NOI increased from the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to a 667,000 increase in rental revenue, (including 539,000 of net deferred rent concessions), offset by a 604,000 increase in real estate operating expenses. See "-Results of Operations - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months ended June 30, 2023 " for a discussion of these changes. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, NOI increased from the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to a 1.5 million increase in rental revenue(including 952,000 of net deferred rent concession), offset by a 1.0 million increase in real estate operating expenses.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 
 
 All of our mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates. Our junior subordinated notes bear interest at the rate of three month term SOFR plus 226 basis points. At September 30, 2024, the interest rate on these notes was 7.52 . Our credit facility bears interest at the rate of one month term SOFR plus 250 basis points. There was no balance outstanding on the credit facility at September 30, 2024. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our related interest expense by approximately 374,000 annually and a 100 basis point decrease in the rates would decrease our related interest expense by 374,000 annually. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, these officers concluded that as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Part II - Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, and in particular, personal injury claims involving the operations of our properties. Although we believe that the primary and umbrella insurance coverage maintained with respect to our properties is sufficient to cover claims for compensatory damages, many of these personal injury claims also assert exemplary( i.e punitive) damages. Generally, insurance does not cover claims for exemplary damages and we may be adversely affected if claims for exemplary damages are asserted successfully. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
