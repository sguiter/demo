Board of Directors, who serves as the Custodian, is responsible for the safekeeping of gold bullion owned by the Company. 

Fair
value of the gold bullion held by the Company is based on that day s London Bullion Market Association LBMA Gold
Price PM. LBMA Gold Price PM is the price per fine troy ounce of gold, stated in U.S. dollars, determined by ICE Benchmark
Administration IBA following an electronic auction consisting of one or more 30-second rounds starting at 3:00 p.m. (London
time), on each day that the London gold market is open for business and published shortly thereafter. 

The
fair value of the treasury bills is based on quoted market prices in an active market. The Company has determined the fair value based
on financial factors that are considered level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. 

Money
market funds included in cash and cash equivalents and U.S. government-backed securities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices
in active markets, which are considered Level 1 inputs. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers in and/or out of the fair
value hierarchy as of the date in which the event or change in circumstances caused the transfer.

doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the

Overview 

Kraig
Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of Wyoming on April 25, 2006. Kraig Labs was organized to develop
high strength fibers using recombinant DNA technology for commercial applications in technical textile. We use genetically engineered
silkworms that produce spider silk proteins to create our recombinant spider silk. Potential applications include performance apparel,
workwear, filtration, luxury fashion, flexible composites, medical implants, cosmetics and more. We believe that we have been a leader
in the research and development of commercially scalable and cost-effective spider silk for technical textile and non-fibrous applications.
Our primary proprietary fiber technology includes natural and engineered variants of spider silk produced in domesticated mulberry silkworms.
Our business brings twenty-first century biotechnology to the historical silk industry, permitting us to introduce materials with innovative
properties and claims into an established commercial ecosystem of silkworm rearing, silk spinning and weaving, and manufacture of garments
and other products that can include our specialty fibers and textiles. Specialty fibers are engineered for specific uses that require
exceptional strength, flexibility, heat resistance and/or chemical resistance. The specialty fiber market is exemplified by two synthetic
fiber products that come from petroleum derivatives: (1) aramid fibers; and (2) ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fibers. The
technical textile industry involves products for both industrial and consumer products, such as filtration fabrics, medical textiles e.g. , sutures and artificial ligaments), safety and protective clothing and fabrics used in military and aerospace applications
(e.g., high-strength composite materials). 

We
are using genetic engineering technologies to develop fibers with greater strength, resiliency and flexibility for use in our target
markets, namely the specialty fiber and technical textile industries. 

25 

We
are continuing to work with our non-CRISPR Cas9 platform technology to accelerate our R D operations. We are refining that approach
for our targeted end-market applications. We are simultaneously working with other technologies to advance, accelerate, and broaden our
genetic engineering capabilities. All of these systems are built on our eco-friendly and cost-effective silkworm production system, which
we believe is more advanced than current competing methods. Knock-in knock-out technology allows for the targeting of specific locations
and genetic traits for modification, addition, and removal. We are implementing these gene editing technologies to develop new protein
structures well beyond the native spider silk sequences that were used to create our Monster silk and dragon silk lines. 

Based
on our internal analysis, management believes that these new platform technologies will allow us to outpace and surpass the performance
of Dragon Silk, a fiber that we developed with our previous tools. Samples of Dragon Silk have already demonstrated to be tougher than
many fibers used in bullet proof vests. We expect that this new approach will yield materials beyond those capabilities based upon its
potential for significantly improved purity. 

In
August 2019, we received authorization from governmental authorities to begin rearing genetically enhanced silkworms at our production
facility in Vietnam. In October 2019, the Company delivered the first batch of these silkworms and began operations. These silkworms
served as the basis for the commercial expansion of our proprietary silk technology. On November 4, 2019, we reported that we had successfully
completed rearing the first batch of its transgenic silkworms at the Quang Nam production factory. Seasonal challenges in late December
2019 slowed production operations, and governmental restrictions imposed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic further delayed our operations
in 2020. In 2021, we received the first shipment of silk from our factory in Vietnam despite obstacles relating to the global pandemic.
Production operations in 2022 and early 2023 were hampered by unseasonable climate fluctuations and poor robustness of the silkworm strains
we were utilizing at that time. To address these challenges, we have taken significant steps to improve the genetics of our silkworms
and radically improve our internal procedures at Kraig labs and Prodigy Textiles to strengthen our operations. We believe that we will
be able to target metric tons of capacity of our recombinant spider silk fiber per annum from our operations once we overcome the current
challenges and reach maximum utilization. This capacity will allow us to address the initial demand for our products and materials for
various applications in the protective, performance, and luxury textile markets. 

The
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to our financial statements as of December 31, 2023, includes an explanatory
paragraph stating that our net loss from operations and net capital deficiency at December 31, 2023, raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty. 

Plan
of Operations 

During
the next twelve months, we expect to take the following steps in connection with the further development of our business and the implementation
of our plan of operations: 

We
 plan to expand our research and development to accelerate our work in creating next generation materials and to improve the robustness
 of our recombinant spider silk lines. This will involve new selective breed protocols, the creation of new hybrids, and the development
 of new transgenics utilizing plasmids that are already in an advanced state of development. 

26 

We
 plan to develop a line of fabrics and apparel, to create a line of spider silk based fashion and performance wear. The company plans
 to pursue this market entry in combination with one or more joint venture or development partners. 

We
 plan to continue the expansion of our spider silk production capacity including new facilities and expansion of existing facilities. 

We
 plan to continue and accelerate our work to improve the overall robustness of our recombinant spider silk lines through a combination
 of climate acclimation, improved silkworm genetics, and the implementation of a multiple-strain hybrid breeding program. This program
 is already in an advanced state 

We
 plan to accelerate both our microbiology and selective breeding programs, as well as provide more resources for our material testing
 protocols. We spent approximately 79,000 over the last 6 months on research and development of high strength polymers. In 2024,
 we are directing our research and development efforts on growing our internal capabilities. 

We
 will consider buying an established revenue producing company in a compatible business, in
 order to broaden our financial base and facilitate the commercialization of our products;
 as of the date hereof, we have not had any formal discussion or entered into any definitive
 agreements regarding any such purchase. 

We
 will also actively consider pursuing collaborative research opportunities with private laboratories in areas of research that overlap
 the company s existing research and development. One such potential area for collaborative research that the company is considering
 is protein expression platforms. If our financing allows, management will strongly consider increasing the breadth of our research
 to include protein expression platform technologies. 

We
 plan to actively pursue collaborative research and product testing opportunities with companies in the biotechnology, materials,
 textile and other industries. 

We
 plan to actively pursue additional collaborative commercialization, marketing and manufacturing opportunities with companies in the
 textile and material sectors for the fibers we developed and for any new polymers that we create in 2024 and going forward. 

We
 plan to actively pursue the development of commercial scale production of our recombinant materials including under the brand names:
 Monster Silk , Dragon Silk TM , SpydaSilk TM , and Spydra TM . 

Limited
Operating History 

We
have not previously demonstrated that we will be able to expand our business through an increased investment in our research and development
efforts. We cannot guarantee that the research and development efforts described in this filing will be successful. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in growing an enterprise, including limited capital resources, risks inherent in the research and development process
and possible rejection of our products in development. 

If
financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our research and development and other operations. Equity
financing will result in dilution to existing stockholders.

Impact
of COVID-19 Outbreak 

On
January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
and on March 10, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world relating to coronavirus include restrictions on travel,
quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. Governmental actions taken relating
to coronavirus are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including
the geographical area in which the Company operates. While the closures and limitations on movement, domestically and internationally,
are expected to be temporary, if these actions continue, the duration of the supply chain disruption could reduce the availability or
result in delays, of materials or supplies to and from the Company, which in turn could materially interrupt the Company s business
operations. Given the speed and frequency of the continuously evolving developments with respect to this pandemic, the Company cannot
reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact to its consolidated results of operations. We have taken every known and reasonable precaution
possible to ensure the safety of our employees. 

On
March 19, 2020, we furloughed non-essential staff in response to governmental regulations relating to COVID. This decision primarily
impacted staff at our fully owned subsidiary, Prodigy Textiles, in Vietnam and resulted in the temporary closing of silk rearing operations
at that facility. As of the date hereof, we have resumed silk production operations at the factory in Vietnam. The Company supported
its furloughed staff and paid their salaries during all mandatory closures. During the duration of the furlough, the Company s
CEO voluntarily waved the payment or accrual of his salary. The Company leveraged this forced closure time to improve its production
infrastructure based on the lessons learned from its operations. After the mandated closure, the Company has enhanced its production
operations with process automation, moved its production headquarters to a facility designed for silk production, created a more self-reliant
supply chain, and established a microbiology laboratory in its factory for enhanced quality control. On October 24, 2020, silk production
operations at the factory resumed. 

The
actions of governments in response to COVID, both domestic and foreign, impacted our ability to transport goods, people, essential equipment,
and other items essential to our production. In turn, these restrictions are impacting our ability to produce intermediate and end products
and are delaying our timelines for commercialization and revenue. 

Additionally,
it is reasonably possible that estimates made in the financial statements have been, or will be, materially and adversely impacted in
the near term as a result of these conditions, including losses on inventory; impairment losses related to goodwill and other long-lived
assets and current obligations.

Capital
Resources and Liquidity 

Our
financial statements have been presented on the basis that we have a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As presented in the unaudited condensed financial statements, we incurred
a net loss of 2,547,264 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and losses are expected to continue in the near term. The accumulated
deficit is 52,234,044 at September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 2 for our discussion of stockholder deficit. We have been funding our operations
through private loans and the sale of common stock in private placement transactions. Our cash resources are insufficient to meet our
planned business objectives without additional financing. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability
of our company to continue as a going concern. 

Management
anticipates that significant additional expenditures will be necessary to develop and expand our business before significant positive
operating cash flows can be achieved. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital
and to ultimately achieve sustainable revenues and profitable operations. At September 30, 2024, we had 1,190,027 of cash on hand. These
funds are insufficient to complete our business plan and as a consequence, we will need to seek additional funds, primarily through the
issuance of debt or equity securities for cash to operate our business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain
undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of
equity financing. 

Management
has undertaken steps as part of a plan to improve operations with the goal of sustaining our operations for the next twelve months and
beyond. These steps include (a) raising additional capital and/or obtaining financing; (b) controlling overhead and expenses; and (c)
executing material sales or research contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company can successfully accomplish these steps and
it is uncertain that the Company will achieve a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance
that any additional financing will be available to the Company on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. As of the date of this
Report, we have not entered into any formal agreements regarding the above. 

In
the event the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may elect or be required to seek protection from its creditors
by filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or may be subject to an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, management has not
considered this alternative, nor does management view it as a likely occurrence.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Please
refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for disclosures regarding the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates,
as well as updates further disclosed in our interim financial statements as described in this Form 10-Q. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Changes
to accounting principles are established by the FASB in the form of Accounting Standards Updates ASU s to the FASB s
Codification. We consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders 
equity, cash flows, or presentation thereof. Management has evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued through the date these
financial statements were available to be issued and found no recent accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet effective accounting
pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 

In
March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit
Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures ASU 2022-02 ), which eliminates the accounting
guidance on troubled debt restructurings TDRs for creditors in ASC 310, Receivables (Topic 310), and requires entities
to provide disclosures about current period gross write-offs by year of origination. Also, ASU 2022-02 updates the requirements related
to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), and adds enhanced disclosures
for creditors with respect to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 was effective
for the Company January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.

This
guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2022-02 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

There
are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application
to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As
of the end of our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon those evaluations, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of September 30, 2024, to cause the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Going
forward from this filing, the Company intends to work on establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed
to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls
is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

the quarter covered by this Report, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. Although we continue
to educate our management personnel to increase its ability to comply with the disclosure requirements and financial reporting controls
and management oversight of accounting and reporting functions in the future, as we stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we do not expect to remediate the weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting until
the time when we start to commercialize a recombinant fiber or such time as we have sufficient cash flow to carry out our remediation
plans.
