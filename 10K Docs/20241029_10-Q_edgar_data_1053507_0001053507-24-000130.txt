 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimates for asset lives based on its historical operating experience. The Company retained an independent consultant to assist the Company in completing this review and analysis. The Company previously depreciated its towers on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) taking into account residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower, which the Company had historically estimated to be years. The Company determined that the estimated useful life of its tower assets is years, before taking into account residual value. Additionally, certain of the Company s intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis to its tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangible assets correlate to the useful life of the towers. The Company accounted for the changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which were recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. On January 1, 2024, the Company began depreciating its towers and related intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful life of the tower, taking into account the extended useful life and residual value. The extension of the asset lives (i) resulted in an approximately million increase in the right of use asset, as additional renewal options may be included, with an offsetting adjustment made to increase the related operating lease liability and (ii) is expected to result in an estimated million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
 years of operating history, and determined that it should modify its current estimated settlement dates based on its historical operating experience, management s intent with respect to the assets, and the assets estimated useful lives. Based on its review and analysis, the Company concluded that a revision in the estimated settlement dates for its asset retirement obligations was appropriate. The Company accounted for the change in estimated settlement dates as a change in accounting estimate under ASC 250 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which was recorded prospectively beginning on January 1, 2024. The extension in the estimated settlement dates (i) resulted in a million increase in the asset retirement obligation liability, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset and an million increase in the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations, and (ii) is expected to result in an estimated million decrease in accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
 Adoption of Highly Inflationary Accounting in Ghana The Ghanaian economy was deemed to be highly inflationary and, as a result, the Company adopted highly inflationary accounting as of January 1, 2024 for its subsidiary in Ghana. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency of its subsidiary in Ghana will become the U.S. Dollar. All monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities will be remeasured at the U.S. Dollar to Ghanaian Cedis exchange rate of 1 to as of December 31, 2023. These amounts will become the new basis for those assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2024. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, as well as the corresponding income statement activities such as

 The Company actively monitors the creditworthiness of its customers. In recognizing customer revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management s estimates, may not be collectible, revenue recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company deferred recognition of revenue of approximately million, net of recoveries, related to a customer of ATC TIPL in India. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million of this previously deferred revenue.

 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, as further discussed in note 1 to its consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The Company concluded that a triggering event occurred as of September 30, 2023 with respect to its India reporting unit primarily due to indications of value received from third parties in connection with the Company s review of various strategic alternatives for its India operations, which concluded in the ATC TIPL Transaction. As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, using, among other things, the information obtained from third parties to compare the estimated fair value of the India reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The result of the Company s interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023 indicated that the carrying amount of the Company's India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The goodwill impairment charge is recorded in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains statements about future events and expectations, or forward-looking statements, which relate to our goals, beliefs, strategies, plans or current expectations and other statements that are not of historical facts. For example, when we use words such as project, plan, believe, anticipate, expect, forecast, estimate, intend, should, would, could, may or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes, we are making forward-looking statements. Certain important factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements, including those factors set forth under the caption Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). Forward-looking statements represent management s current expectations, beliefs and assumptions, and are inherently uncertain. We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements. 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes, information set forth under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the 2023 Form 10-K, and in particular, the information set forth therein under Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 In 2023, we undertook a strategic review of our India operations, where we evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within our global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below). 
 On January 4, 2024, we, t hrough our subsidiaries, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. and ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited ATC TIPL , which holds our operations in India , entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust DIT ), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100 ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the ATC TIPL Transaction ). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration would potentially represent up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees INR (approximately 2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed below), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of our existing term loan in India, by DIT. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately 354.1 million) to us, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by us at closing. 
 The ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, we completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately 2.2 billion). We used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under our 6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021, as further amended (the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility ). We recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of 1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of our cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of 1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. See note 15 to our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report Note 15 for further discussion. Prior to the divestiture and classification as discontinued operations, ATC TIPL s operating results were included within the Asia-Pacific property segment. Historical financial information included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the operating results of ATC TIPL as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Overview 
 We are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 98 of our total revenues for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and includes our U.S. Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment. 
 We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.

The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of September 30, 2024:

As of September 30, 2024, our property portfolio included 28 operating data center facilities across ten markets in the United States that collectively comprise approximately 3.2 million net rentable square feet NRSF of data center space, as follows:

 (1) Excludes approximately 0.4 million of office and light industrial NRSF. 
 We operate in seven reportable segments: U.S. Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. In evaluating operating performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 14 to our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report). 
 The 2023 Form 10-K contains information regarding management s expectations of long-term drivers of demand for our communications sites, as well as key trends, which management believes provide valuable insight into our operating and financial resource allocation decisions. The discussion below should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K and, in particular, the information set forth therein under Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview. 
 In most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase or escalate the rent due under the lease, typically based on (a) an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3 in the United States), (b) an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or (c) a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs (pass-through revenue), such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. 
 Based upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of September 30, 2024, we expect to generate nearly 55 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. 
 Following the rulings by the Supreme Court of India regarding carriers obligations for the adjusted gross revenue fees and charges prescribed by the court, we experienced variability and a level of uncertainty in collections in India. As further discussed in Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the caption Risk Factors A substantial portion of our current and projected future revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers, in the third quarter of 2022, one of our customers in India, Vodafone Idea Limited VIL ), communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us (the VIL Shortfall ). We recorded reserves in late 2022 and the first half of 2023 for the VIL Shortfall. In the second half of 2023, VIL began making payments in full of its monthly contractual obligations owed to us. 
 37 

In February 2023, and as amended in August 2023, VIL issued optionally convertible debentures (the VIL OCDs to ATC TIPL in exchange for VIL s payment of certain amounts towards accounts receivables. The VIL OCDs were issued for an aggregate face value of 16.0 billion Indian Rupees INR (approximately 193.2 million on the date of issuance). On March 23, 2024, we converted an aggregate face value of 14.4 billion INR (approximately 172.7 million) of VIL OCDs into 1,440 million shares of equity of VIL (the VIL Shares ). On April 29, 2024, we completed the sale of 1,440 million VIL Shares at a price of 12.78 INR per share. The net proceeds for this transaction were approximately 18.0 billion INR (approximately 216.0 million at the date of settlement) after deducting commissions and fees. On June 5, 2024, we completed the sale of the remaining aggregate face value of 1.6 billion INR (approximately 19.2 million) of the VIL OCDs. The net proceeds for this transaction, excluding accrued interest, were approximately 1.8 billion INR (approximately 22.0 million at the date of settlement) after deducting fees. As of September 30, 2024, none of the VIL Shares or the VIL OCDs remained outstanding. 
 In 2023, we initiated a strategic review of our India business, as discussed above. During the process, and based on information gathered therein, we updated our estimate on the fair value of the India reporting unit and determined that the carrying value exceeded fair value. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 322.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 ATC TIPL s operating results are presented as discontinued operations. See Note 15 for further discussion. 
 The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, churn was approximately 2 of our tenant billings, primarily driven by churn in our U.S. Canada property segment, as discussed below. 
 We expect that our churn rate in our U.S. Canada property segment will remain elevated through 2025 due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of our master lease agreement with T-Mobile US, Inc. entered into in September 2020. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted Adjusted EBITDA ), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders and Adjusted Funds From Operations AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders ). 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense), including Goodwill impairment; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. 
 Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion including adjustments and distributions for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests and discontinued operations. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Nareit FFO (common stockholders). 
 We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax and other income tax adjustments; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and (viii) other operating income (expense); less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures and including adjustments and distributions for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests and adjustments for discontinued operations, which includes the impact of noncontrolling interests and discontinued operations on both Nareit FFO and the corresponding adjustments included in AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as AFFO (common stockholders). 
 38 

Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders) or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) AFFO (common stockholders) is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. 
 Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.

 The decreases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to the change in estimated useful lives of our tower assets. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we finalized our reviews of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets and estimated settlement dates for our asset retirement obligations. Based on information obtained, we determined that our estimated asset lives and our estimated settlement dates should be extended, which is expected to result in an estimated 730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and an estimated 75 million decrease in accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2024. For more information on the change in the estimated useful lives of our tower assets and the change in the estimated settlement dates for our asset retirement obligations, see the information under the captions Property and Equipment and Asset Retirement Obligations included in note 1 to our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report Note 1 ).

 Total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries functional currencies. 
 The increase in total other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to foreign currency losses of 337.4 million in the current period, as compared to foreign currency gains of 239.0 million in the prior-year period. Total other expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 also includes 67.9 million in unrealized gains from equity securities in the United States.

 As a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes REIT ), we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the federal statutory rate. 
 The increases in the income tax provision during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to increased earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, partially due to the impacts of the change in estimated useful lives on depreciation and amortization expense as described in Note 1. Additionally, the income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes increases in tax expense related to unrealized gains from equity securities in the United States and anticipated foreign audit settlements.

 As of September 30, 2024, the key terms under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility and our 1.0 billion unsecured term loan, as amended and restated in December 2021, as further amended (the 2021 Term Loan ), were as follows: 
 Bank Facility Outstanding Principal Balance in millions) Maturity Date SOFR or EURIBOR borrowing interest rate range (1) Base rate borrowing interest rate range (1) Current margin over SOFR or EURIBOR and the base rate, respectively 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility (2) 140.0 July 1, 2026 (3) 0.875 - 1.500 0.000 - 0.500 1.125 and 0.125 2021 Credit Facility (2) 1,068.0 July 1, 2028 (3) 0.875 - 1.500 0.000 - 0.500 1.125 and 0.125 2021 Term Loan (2) 1,000.0 January 31, 2027 0.875 - 1.750 0.000 - 0.750 1.125 and 0.125 
 ___________ 
 (1) Represents interest rate above: (a) SOFR for SOFR based borrowings, (b) Euro Interbank Offer Rate EURIBOR for EURIBOR based borrowings and (c) the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. 
 (2) Currently borrowed at SOFR. 
 (3) Subject to two optional renewal periods. 
 
 We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility. The commitment fee for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080 to 0.200 per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110 . 
 The 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility and the 2021 Term Loan and the associated loan agreements (the Bank Loan Agreements do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate, SOFR or EURIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities. 
 Each Bank Loan Agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with these financial and operating covenants could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. 
 India Term Loan On February 17, 2023, we borrowed 10.0 billion INR (approximately 120.7 million at the date of borrowing) under an unsecured term loan in India with a maturity date that is one year from the date of the first draw thereunder (the India Term Loan ). In January 2024, we amended the India Term Loan to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2024. On September 12, 2024, in connection with the completion of the ATC TIPL Transaction, we repaid the India Term Loan. 
 Stock Repurchase Programs In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to 1.5 billion of our common stock (the 2011 Buyback ). In December 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to 2.0 billion of our common stock (the 2017 Buyback, and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the Buyback Programs ). 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no repurchases under either of the Buyback Programs. 
 We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately 2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases. 
 Sales of Equity Securities We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan. During the nine months ended 
 56 

September 30, 2024, we received an aggregate of 38.1 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. 
 Future Financing Transactions We regularly consider various options to obtain financing and access the capital markets, subject to market conditions, to meet our funding needs. Such capital raising alternatives, in addition to those noted above, may include amendments and extensions of our bank facilities, entry into new bank facilities, transactions with private equity funds or partnerships, additional senior note and equity offerings and securitization transactions. No assurance can be given as to whether any such financing transactions will be completed or as to the timing or terms thereof. 
 Distributions As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of net operating losses NOLs ). We have distributed an aggregate of approximately 19.8 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in October 2024, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years beginning before 2026. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 4.94 per share, or 2.3 billion, to our common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of 1.62 per share, or 757.0 million, paid on October 25, 2024 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2024. 
 The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
 We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. As of September 30, 2024, the amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was 20.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 11.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. 
 Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity 
 As discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of the 2023 Form 10-K, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. 
 Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities Each Bank Loan Agreement contains certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The Bank Loan Agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. 
 57 

Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended September 30, 2024 in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3) Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 6.00:1.00 ~ 3.9 ~ 0.6 Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 3.00:1.00 ~ 18.1 (4) ~ 6.0 
 _______________ 
 (1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement. 
 (2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 (3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. 
 (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. 
 The Bank Loan Agreements also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. 
 Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the Bank Loan Agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may also constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the Bank Loan Agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. 
 Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations The indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the Series 2015-2 Notes issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC GTP Acquisition Partners in a private securitization transaction in May 2015 (the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the securitization transactions completed in March 2018 (the 2018 Securitization and March 2023 (the 2023 Securitization and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the Trust Securitizations (collectively, the Securitization Loan Agreements include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the AMT Asset Subs are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements). 
 Under the Securitization Loan Agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the Series 2018-1A Securities ), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the Series 2018-1R Securities and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the 2018 Securities ), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities 2023-1, Subclass A (the Series 2023-1A Securities ), the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2023-1, Subclass R (the Series 2023-1R Securities and, together with the Series 2023-1A Securities, the 2023 Securities issued in the Trust Securitizations (the Loan ), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after paying all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of these assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to us for use. As of September 30, 2024, 81.7 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. 
 Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio DSCR is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

 (1) Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of September 30, 2024 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. 
 (2) If the DSCR were equal to or below 1.30x (the Cash Trap DSCR for any quarter, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the Cash Trap Reserve Account instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. 
 (3) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the Minimum DSCR at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. 
 (4) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in that event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and that series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. 
 (5) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until the principal has been repaid in full. 
 
 A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of those notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,340 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,029 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose those sites and their associated revenue. 
 As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Additionally, as further discussed under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K, market volatility and disruption caused by inflation, 
 59 

rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations, or refinance our existing indebtedness. 
 In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption Risk Factors in Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. 
 For more information regarding the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, revenue recognition, rent expense, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets, as further discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have made no material changes to the critical accounting policies described in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounting Standards Update 
 For a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 140.0 million under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, 1.1 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility and 1.0 billion under the 2021 Term Loan. A 10 increase in current interest rates would result in an additional 10.5 million of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 35 of our revenues and 43 of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in 34.4 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have 7.5 billion EUR (approximately 8.4 billion) denominated debt outstanding. An adverse change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our outstanding EUR debt would result in 0.9 billion of foreign currency losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 61 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K.
