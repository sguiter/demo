Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 2 to the Financial Statements describes
the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. Estimates are used for, but not limited
to, contingencies and taxes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following critical accounting policies
are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. 

We are subject to various loss contingencies arising
in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as
well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is
accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals
should be adjusted. 

We recognize deferred tax assets (future tax benefits)
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis
of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax return consequences of those
differences, which are expected to be either deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Future
tax benefits have been fully offset by a 100 valuation allowance as management is unable to determine that it is more likely than not
that this deferred tax asset will be realized. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to
investors. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all the new accounting
pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise
disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that
are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC ), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. 

The following aspects of the Company were noted
as potential material weaknesses: 

lack of an audit committee 

lack of segregation of duties 

In designing and evaluating disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that no change occurred in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting
during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal controls over financial reporting.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide the information under this Item; however,
due to the current circumstance we have chosen to include the following risk factor.

have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company
operates. While it is unknown how long these conditions will last and what the complete financial effect will be on the company, to date,
the Company has not experienced a material impact.
