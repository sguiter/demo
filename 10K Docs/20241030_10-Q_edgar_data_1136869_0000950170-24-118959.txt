In December 2019, our Board of Directors approved, and we initiated, a global restructuring program (the 2019 Restructuring Plan with an objective of reducing structural costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities. The 2019 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately million. The pre-tax restructuring charges consist of employee termination benefits; contract terminations for facilities and sales agents; and other charges, such as consulting fees, project management expenses and relocation costs, including costs to close a manufacturing facility. The remaining costs relate to the closure of a manufacturing facility, which is expected to be completed in 2025.

Expense estimated to be recognized for the 2019 Restructuring Plan 

We do not include restructuring charges in the operating profit of our reportable segments. We report the expenses for other cost reduction and optimization initiatives in our Restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives financial statement line item because these activities also have the goal of reducing costs across the organization. However, since the cost reduction initiative expenses are not considered restructuring, they have been excluded from the amounts presented in this note.

Property, plant and equipment, net 

We had million and million of property, plant and equipment included in accounts payable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of a third party orthopedics distributor in the EMEA market. Prior to the acquisition, the distributor sold our products to its customers. The acquisition is expected to improve our margins and allow us to better serve the end customers. On , we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of V.I.M.S. Vid o Interventionnelle M dicale Scientifique, a privately-held medical device company based in France, which expands our portfolio in the sports medicine market. 

 11 

, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of a privately-held medical device company based in the United States, which expands our portfolio in the CMFT market. Initial consideration related to these three acquisitions was million with additional consideration up to million, subject to the achievement of future regulatory milestones and commercial milestones. We determined the fair value of the additional consideration to be million as of the acquisition dates. The goodwill related to these acquisitions represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill related to these acquisitions is generated from the operational synergies, cross-selling opportunities and future development we expect to achieve from the technologies acquired. goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill related to the April acquisitions is included in the EM EA operating segment and reporting unit. The goodwill related to the August acquisition is included in the Americas operating segment and the Americas CMFT reporting unit. The goodwill related to these acquisitions was the only significant activity related to our consolidated goodwill balance in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, other than changes related to foreign currency exchange rate translation adjustments. The purchase price allocations for the three acquisitions described above are preliminary as of September 30, 2024. We need additional time to evaluate the technology and tax attributes of those transactions, which may change the recognized intangible assets and tax assets and liabilities. There may be differences between the preliminary estimates of fair value and the final acquisition accounting. The final estimates of fair value are expected to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than one year after the respective acquisition dates.

The weighted average amortization periods selected for technology, trademarks and trade names and customer relationships were years, years and years, respectively. Upon receiving regulatory approval subsequent to the applicable acquisition date, the million of IPR D was reclassified to a definite-lived intangible asset and began amortizing over the applicable estimated useful life. On , we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Embody, Inc. ("Embody"), a medical device company focused on soft tissue healing, that expands our portfolio for the sports medicine market. The initial consideration consisted of the issuance of million shares of our common stock valued at million and million of cash for a total value of million. The fair value of our common stock was determined to be per share, which represented the average of our high and low stock prices on the acquisition date. The Embody acquisition includes additional consideration of up to million in fair value of our common shares and cash, subject to achieving a future regulatory milestone after closing and commercial milestones based on sales growth over a three-year period. We assigned a fair value of million for this contingent consideration as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability was calculated based on the probability of achieving the specified regulatory milestone and by simulating numerous potential outcomes for the commercial milestones and discounting to present value the estimated payments. On , we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of a privately-held orthopedics medical device company that expands our portfolio in the orthopedics market ("April 2023 acquisition"). The initial consideration consisted of million of cash and includes consideration of up to million in cash, subject to achieving future regulatory milestones.

, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of a privately-held orthopedics medical device company that provides us new surgical technology that can be used in procedures across multiple product categories October 2023 acquisition ). The initial consideration consisted of million of cash and includes additional consideration of up to million in cash contingent upon achieving certain commercial milestones based on sales growth over a three-year period. We assigned a fair value of million for this contingent consideration as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the contingent liability was calculated based on the probability of achieving the commercial milestones and discounting to present value the estimated payments. On , we completed the acquisition of a privately-held technology company by acquiring certain assets, liabilities and employees of the technology company November 2023 acquisition ). The November 2023 acquisition expands our technology and data capabilities and solutions across multiple product categories to better serve our customers. The initial consideration consisted of million of cash and includes additional consideration of up to million in cash contingent upon achieving a commercial milestone based on a certain sales target which must be achieved by December 31, 2025. We assigned a fair value of million for this contingent consideration as of the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the contingent liability was calculated based on the probability of achieving the commercial milestone and discounting to present value the estimated payment. These four acquisitions are collectively referred to in this report as the 2023 acquisitions . Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the issuance of common stock and cash payments related to the contingent consideration liabilities that have occurred subsequent to the acquisition dates. The goodwill related to the 2023 acquisitions represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill related to the 2023 acquisitions is generated from the operational synergies and cross-selling opportunities we expect to achieve from the technologies acquired. A portion of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The goodwill related to the Embody, the October 2023 and the November 2023 acquisitions is included in the Americas operating segment and the Americas Orthopedics reporting unit. The goodwill related to the April 2023 acquisition is included in the Asia Pacific operating segment and reporting unit. The goodwill related to the first two of the 2023 acquisition was the only significant activity related to our consolidated goodwill balance in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, other than changes related to foreign currency exchange rate translation adjustments. The purchase price allocations for the Embody acquisition, the October 2023 acquisition and the April 2023 acquisition were final as of September 30, 2024. The purchase price allocation for the November 2023 acquisition is preliminary as of September 30, 2024. We need additional time to evaluate the tax attributes of the transaction, which may change the recognized tax assets and liabilities. There may be differences between the preliminary estimates of fair value and the final acquisition accounting.

million related to agreements we have entered into in order to acquire the ownership rights or gain access to various technologies. The weighted average amortization period selected for these intangible assets was years. The contractual payments under these agreements are included in "Acquisition of intangible assets" in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We have recognized current liabilities of approximately million for the remaining portion of the payments which represents a noncash investing activity for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we entered into agreements to acquire intellectual property rights through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements. These new agreements and the related payments replace the variable royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of previous licensing arrangements through 2030. These new agreements benefit us by expanding our ownership of intellectual property that we may use in the future. We recognized intangible assets of million related to these agreements which will be amortized through 2030. The payments under these agreements have been included in "Acquisition of intangible assets" in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

On August 15, 2024, we completed the offering of million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due September 15, 2034. Interest is payable on these Senior Notes March 15 and September 15 of each year until maturity. We received net proceeds of million. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we redeemed million outstanding principal amount on a short-term term loan by paying million in cash and by transferring all our common shares we owned of a publicly traded company we previously spun-off. The transfer of the common shares as part of the settlement resulted in a million noncash financing activity. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 we also redeemed million outstanding principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2023.

unsecured revolving facility of billion (the 2024 Five-Year Revolving Facility ). The 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced the previous revolving credit agreement entered into on July 7, 2023 (the 2023 Five-Year Credit Agreement ), which contained a unsecured revolving facility of billion (the 2023 Five-Year Revolving Facility ). There were outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Five-Year Credit Agreement at the time it was terminated. The 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement will mature on , with two one-year extensions exercisable at our discretion and subject to required lender consent. The 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement also includes an uncommitted incremental feature allowing us to request an increase of the facility by an aggregate amount of up to million. Borrowings under the 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates, based upon either an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate Term SOFR for the applicable interest period or an alternate base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term debt credit rating. We pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the 2024 Five-Year Revolving Facility at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term debt credit rating. The 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for unsecured financing arrangements, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. The 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio of no greater than to as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (with such ratio subject to increase to to for a period of time in connection with a qualified material acquisition and certain other restrictions). We were in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Five-Year Credit Agreement. The 2024 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of billion (the 2024 364-Day Revolving Facility ). The 2024 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement replaced a credit agreement entered into on July 7, 2023, which was also a 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility of billion (the 2023 364-Day Revolving Facility ). There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2023 364-Day Revolving Facility when it was terminated. The 2024 364-Day Revolving Facility will mature on . Borrowings under the 2024 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon either an adjusted Term SOFR for the applicable interest period or an alternate base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term debt credit rating. We pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the 2024 364-Day Revolving Facility at a rate determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term debt credit rating. The 2024 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. The 2024 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ratio of no greater than to as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (with such ratio subject to increase to to in connection with a qualified material acquisition and certain other restrictions). We were in compliance with all covenants under the 2024 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding borrowings under the 2024 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement. On August 28, 2023, we entered into an uncommitted facility letter (the "Uncommitted Credit Facility"), which provides that from time to time, we may request, and the lender in its absolute and sole discretion may provide, short-term loans. Borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facility may be used only for general corporate and working capital purposes. The Uncommitted Credit Facility provides that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings at any time shall not exceed million. Each borrowing under the Uncommitted Credit Facility will mature on the maturity date specified by the lender at the time of the advance, which will be no more than 90 days following the date of the advance. The Uncommitted Credit Facility and borrowings thereunder are unsecured. Borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facility bear interest at floating rates, based upon either Term SOFR for the applicable interest period, the prime rate, or lender s cost of funds, in each case, plus an applicable margin determined at the time of each borrowing. The Uncommitted Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for unsecured uncommitted financing arrangements. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Uncommitted Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were outstanding borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facility.

We value our foreign currency forward contracts using a market approach based on foreign currency exchange rates obtained from active markets, and we perform ongoing assessments of counterparty credit risk. We value our interest rate swaps using a market approach based on publicly available market yield curves and the terms of our swaps, and we perform ongoing assessments of counterparty credit risk. The valuation of our cross-currency interest rate swaps also includes consideration of foreign currency exchange rates. Contingent payments related to acquisitions consist of sales-based payments and regulatory milestones, and are valued using discounted cash flow techniques. The fair value of sales-based payments is based upon significant unobservable inputs such as probability-weighted future revenue estimates and simulating the numerous potential outcomes, and changes as revenue estimates increase or decrease. The fair value of the regulatory milestones is based on the probability of success in obtaining the specified regulatory approval. Contingent payments related to the Embody acquisition are to be settled by issuance of our common stock and cash payments. The Embody acquisition is discussed in Note 7. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we issued million shares of our common stock valued at million and paid million of cash for a commercial milestone related to the Embody acquisition. The fair value of common stock was determined to be per share, which represented the average of our high and low stock prices on the settlement date. To minimize dilution from issuing shares for the milestone settlement, we repurchased million shares of our common stock in February of 2024.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges In 2014, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of our tranche of senior notes due 2045 we expected to issue in 2015. The forward starting interest rate swaps mitigated the risk of changes in interest rates prior to the completion of the notes offering. The interest rate swaps were settled, and the remaining loss to be recognized at September 30, 2024 was million, which will be recognized using the effective interest rate method over the remaining maturity period of the hedged notes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce the potential effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. We also designated our Euro Notes as net investment hedges of investments in foreign subsidiaries. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles, Indian Rupees, Turkish Lira, Polish Zloty, Danish Krone, and Norwegian Krone. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivatives Designated as Net Investment Hedges We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the investments in our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In order to mitigate the volatility in foreign exchange rates, we issued Euro Notes in December 2016 and November 2019 and designated percent of the Euro Notes to hedge our net investment in certain wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries that have a functional currency of the Euro. All changes in the fair value of a hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge are recorded as a component of AOCI in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024, we had receive-fixed-rate, pay-fixed-rate cross-currency interest swaps with notional amounts outstanding of Euro million, Japanese Yen billion and Swiss Franc million. These transactions further hedge our net investment in certain wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries that have a functional currency of Euro, Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc. All changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge are recorded as a component of AOCI in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The portion of this change related to the excluded component will be amortized into earnings over the life of the derivative while the remainder will be recorded in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or substantially liquidated. We recognize the excluded component in interest expense, net on our condensed consolidated statements of earnings. The 

 19 

million of these cross-currency interest rate swaps matured at a loss of million. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, Euro million and Swiss Franc million of these cross-currency interest rate swaps matured at a gain of million and loss of million, respectively. The settlement of these gains and losses with the counterparties is reflected in investing cash flows in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and will remain in AOCI on our condensed consolidated balance sheet until the hedged net investment is sold or substantially liquidated. Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges Our revenues are generated in various currencies throughout the world. However, a significant amount of our inventory is produced in U.S. Dollars. Therefore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates may have different proportional effects on our revenues compared to our cost of products sold. To minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on cash flows, we hedge intercompany sales of inventory expected to occur within the next months with foreign currency exchange forward contracts. We designate these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. We perform quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness by verifying and documenting the critical terms of the hedge instrument and confirming that forecasted transactions have not changed significantly. We also assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the gains and losses are temporarily recorded in AOCI and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. On our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the settlements of these cash flow hedges are recognized in operating cash flows. For foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options outstanding at September 30, 2024, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Indian Rupees, Polish Zloty, Danish Krone, and Norwegian Krone and obligations to purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars. These derivatives mature at dates ranging from October 2024 through February 2027. As of September 30, 2024 , the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts and options entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars were million. As of September 30, 2024 , the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts and options entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs were million. Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one to three months to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency. As a result, any foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. The net amount of these offsetting gains/losses is recorded in other income, net. Any outstanding contracts are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. The notional amounts of these contracts are generally in a range of billion to billion per quarter. Income Statement Presentation Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges)

million decrease to a million increase. We are under continuous audit by the IRS and have disputes with the IRS and other foreign taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate require payment of disputed taxes to petition a court or taxing authority, or we may elect to make such payments prior to final resolution. We record any prepayments as income tax receivables when we believe our position is more likely than not to be upheld. We assess our position on these disputes at each reporting period. During the course of these audits and disputes, we receive proposed adjustments from taxing authorities that may be material. Therefore, there is a possibility that an adverse outcome in these audits or disputes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2019. In September 2024, we reached agreement with the IRS for tax years 2010-2012 primarily related to the reallocation of profits between certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. All issues related to these years are considered effectively settled. The IRS has proposed adjustments for tax years 2013-2015, primarily related to transfer pricing involving our cost sharing agreement between the U.S. and Switzerland affiliated companies and the reallocation of profits between certain of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. This includes a proposed increase to our U.S. federal taxable income, which would result in additional tax expense related to 2013 of approximately million, subject to interest and penalties. We strongly believe that the position of the IRS, with regard to this matter, is inconsistent with the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing our cost sharing agreement. We intend to continue to vigorously contest the adjustment, and we will pursue all available administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies. If we pursue judicial remedies in the U.S. Tax Court for years 2013-2015, a number of years will likely elapse before such matters are finally resolved. No payment of any amount related to this matter is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings have been completed. The IRS has proposed adjustments for tax years 2016-2019, primarily related to the U.S. taxation of foreign earnings and profits, which could result in additional material tax expense if we are unsuccessful in defending our position. This includes a proposed increase to our U.S. federal taxable income, which would result in additional tax expense of approximately million, subject to interest. We strongly believe that the position of the IRS, with regard to this matter, is inconsistent with the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. We intend to continue to vigorously contest the adjustment, and we will pursue all available administrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies. If we pursue judicial remedies in the U.S. Tax Court for years 2016-2019, a number of years will likely elapse before such matters are finally resolved. No payment of any amount related to this matter is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings have been completed. In the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate ETR was negative percent and positive percent, respectively, compared to positive percent and positive percent in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The negative percent ETR and positive percent in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were primarily driven by a net favorable impact of changes to unrecognized tax benefits. The positive percent and positive percent ETR in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily driven by discrete tax effects of certain tax returns and the reorganization of the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2023. Absent discrete tax events, we expect our future ETR will be lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of percent due to our mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign locations, which generally have lower corporate income tax rates. Our ETR in future periods could also potentially be impacted by: changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings;

Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted net earnings per share 

During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, an average of million options and million options, respectively, to purchase shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. During the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, an average of million and million options, respectively, to purchase shares of common stock were not included for the same reason. 

 operating segments. These operating segments, which also constitute our reportable segments, are Americas; EMEA; and Asia Pacific. Our CODM evaluates performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses and income pertaining to intangible asset amortization, certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges, restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives, acquisition, integration, divestiture and related, litigation, certain European Union Medical Device Regulation EU MDR expenses, other charges and corporate functions (collectively referred to as Corporate items ). Corporate functions include finance, corporate legal, information technology, human resources and other corporate departments as well as stock-based compensation and certain operations, distribution, quality assurance, regulatory assurance, research and development ("R D") and marketing expenses. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from segment operating profit. Our Americas operating segment is comprised principally of the U.S. and includes other North, Central and South American markets. Our EMEA operating segment is comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and African markets. Our Asia Pacific operating segment is comprised principally of Japan, China and Australia and includes other Asian and Pacific markets. The Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments include the commercial operations as well as regional headquarter expenses to operate in those markets. Our operating segments do not include many centralized, product category expenses such as R D and global marketing that benefit all regions. In the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, the segment operating profit measures our CODM reviews were revised. Certain product category headquarter costs, primarily R D and marketing, that were previously in our Americas operating segment are now included in Corporate items. In addition, certain support function costs from our operating segments are now included in Corporate items. We have reclassified these product category headquarter and support function expenses in the prior periods to conform to the current period presentation.

Item 2. Manag ement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Amounts reported in millions within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are computed based on the actual amounts. As a result, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. In addition, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum to the totals due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying unrounded amounts. 
 Executive Level Overview 
 Results for the Three and Nine-Month Periods ended September 30, 2024 
 In the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, our net sales increased 4.0 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, when compared to the same prior year periods. Net sales growth in both periods was driven by a combination of market growth, new product introductions and commercial execution across the organization. These favorable items were negatively impacted by our transition in July 2024 to a new enterprise resource planning ("ERP") software system for a significant portion of our U.S. and Canada sales and commercial operations. As a result of this ERP implementation, we experienced operational challenges which affected our ability to fulfill certain customer orders. This disruption mostly affected our U.S. net sales, but our International net sales were also impacted as shipments to our international affiliates were delayed. Through the quarter we saw improvement in our shipping levels to our end customers. We expect our shipping levels to return to similar levels that existed prior to the implementation by the end of the year. For the full year 2024, we estimate this ERP implementation will have less than a one percent impact to our net sales. In addition, our net sales experienced negative effects of 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Our net earnings were 249.1 million and 664.3 million in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 162.7 million and 604.8 million in the same prior year periods, respectively. The increase in earnings in the three and nine-month periods was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized resulting from an agreement with the IRS for tax years 2010-2012, the net sales increase, lower expenses due to our 2023 Restructuring Plan and cost savings initiatives, and lower research and development ("R D") spending on the European Union Medical Device Regulation ("EU MDR"). These favorable items were partially offset by charges from our 2023 Restructuring Plan which was instituted at the end of 2023 and continued into 2024, including 83.2 million in employee termination benefits-related charges recognized in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and from additional expenses related to our U.S. and Canada ERP implementation. 
 2024 Outlook 
 We expect year-over-year revenue growth of mid-single digits in 2024 to be driven by a combination of market growth, new product introductions and commercial execution. Based on recent foreign currency exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to negatively affect year-over-year net sales by approximately 0.75 percent. We estimate operating profit will increase in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to higher net sales, leverage from fixed operating expenses and lower expenses due to our restructuring plans. However, we estimate these favorable items may be partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization and increased restructuring-related costs to implement our plans. We estimate our net interest expense will increase slightly due to higher interest rates. We expect our provision for income taxes will increase in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to larger favorable tax settlements in 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 	 We review sales by two geographies, the United States and International, and by the following product categories: Knees; Hips; S.E.T. (Sports Medicine, Extremities, Trauma, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic); and Other. This sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources toward achieving operating profit goals. We review sales by these geographies because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories, because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies and many of our competitors publicly report in this manner. Our business is seasonal in nature to some extent, as many of our products are used in elective surgical procedures, which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans.

Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends 
 
 Changes in volume and mix of product sales had positive effects of 3.4 percent and 4.2 percent on year-over-year sales during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Market growth and new product introductions contributed positively to volume and mix trends, but were partially offset by the operational challenges resulting from our ERP implementation. 
 Pricing Trends 
 Global selling prices had positive effects of 0.7 percent and 0.6 percent on year-over-year sales during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The majority of countries in which we operate continue to experience pricing pressure from local hospitals, health systems, and governmental healthcare cost containment efforts. However, we have had success in offsetting negative effects of pricing pressure due to internal initiatives and being able to pass some inflationary impacts on to customers. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had negative effects of 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent on year-over-year sales, respectively. If foreign currency exchange rates remain at levels consistent with recent rates, we estimate there will be a negative impact of approximately 0.75 percent on full-year 2024 sales. 
 Geography 
 The 2.0 percent and 3.1 percent net sales growth in the U.S. in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were driven by market growth in our Knees, Hips and S.E.T. product categories. However, net sales in the U.S. were negatively impacted by the implementation of a new ERP system which caused operational challenges in fulfilling customer orders. Internationally, net sales increased by 6.9 percent and 4.5 percent during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same prior year periods. These increases were similarly driven by market growth in most of our international markets. Our International sales were negatively affected by 0.2 percent and 2.6 percent due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Product Categories 
 Knees and Hips net sales benefited from market growth and new product introductions in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a minimal impact and a negative effect of 0.9 percent on Knees net sales in the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Hips net sales were negatively affected by 0.2 percent and 1.6 percent in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. S.E.T. net sales increases in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were primarily the result of growth in our sports medicine, upper extremities, and craniomaxillofacial and thoracic products. Other net sales declined in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 due to the operational challenges from our ERP system implementation and from lower net sales of our ROSA Robot. Other net sales grew in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, driven by net sales of our ROSA Robot in the first half of the year.

Cost of products sold, excluding intangible asset amortization as a percentage of net sales decreased in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same prior year periods. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges which was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs which were partially offset by lower royalty expense. The reduction in royalty expense was partially the result of agreements we entered into in 2023 to acquire intellectual property through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements, which are recognized as intangible assets and result in additional intangible asset amortization expense instead of royalty expense. 
 Intangible asset amortization expense increased in amount in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods due to the 2023 acquisitions, the buyout of certain royalty-related licensing agreements as described above and other technology-based asset purchases. 
 R D expenses decreased in amount and as a percentage of net sales in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. The decreases were driven by lower spending on our initial compliance with the EU MDR as we continue to make progress on the approvals of our products, and savings from our 2023 Restructuring Plan. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased in amount in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. SG A as a percentage of net sales increased in the three-month period, but decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. The increase in amounts in both periods was due to selling and distribution costs that are variable expenses which increase as net sales increase. Additionally, we recognized higher share-based compensation expense in the 2024 periods as the 2023 periods included a benefit from the forfeiture of awards related to employee departures. Also in the 2024 periods, bad debt-related charges were higher driven by a bankruptcy at a significant U.S. healthcare system, instrument-related costs were higher due to new product introductions, and we recognized higher charges on various strategic initiatives. These higher costs were partially offset by lower expenses due to our 2023 Restructuring Plan, lower expenses from our cost savings initiatives and lower estimated annual bonus expenses. 
 In December of 2023, 2021 and 2019, we initiated global restructuring programs. We also have other cost reduction and optimization initiatives that have the goal of reducing costs across the organization. We recognized expenses of 32.2 million and 198.1 million in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 24.3 million and 90.6 million in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily related to employee termination benefits, sales agent contract terminations, and consulting and project management expenses associated with these programs, as well as expenses related to other optimization initiatives. The expenses were higher in the 2024 periods when compared to the 2023 periods primarily due to additional expenses related to the 2023 Restructuring Plan that had just been initiated at the end of 2023 and additional expenses related to our U.S. and Canada ERP implementation. For more information regarding these expenses, see Note 4 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 Acquisition, integration, divestiture and related expenses decreased in amount and as a percentage of net sales in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods, primarily due to changes in fair value estimates of contingent consideration. 
 Other Income, Net, Interest Expense, Net, and Income Taxes 
 In the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gains of 5.1 million and 7.0 million, respectively, in our other income, net financial statement line item compared to gains of 3.8 million and 10.3 million in the same prior year periods, respectively. The changes in the three and nine-month periods were primarily driven by the timing of gains and losses recognized on our equity investments. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recognized higher gains from our investments when compared to the same prior year period while in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we recognized losses compared to gains in the same prior year period. 
 Interest expense, net, increased in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. The increased interest expense was due to higher average debt balances outstanding and losses incurred on our fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps in the current year periods. 
 In the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate ETR was negative 8.2 percent and positive 11.0 percent, respectively, compared to positive 25.7 percent and positive 22.7 percent in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The negative 8.2 percent ETR and positive 11.0 percent in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were primarily driven by a net favorable impact of changes to unrecognized tax benefits. The positive 25.7 percent and positive 22.7 percent ETR in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily driven by discrete tax effects of certain tax returns and the reorganization of the ownership structure of certain 
 30 

wholly-owned subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2023. Absent discrete tax events, we expect our future ETR will be lower than the U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21.0 percent due to our mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign locations, which generally have lower corporate income tax rates. Our ETR in future periods could also potentially be impacted by: changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings; changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation, including the European Union adoption of Pillar Two proposals which began to take effect in 2024; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits, appeals, and litigation; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. Currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.

Americas 
 In the Americas, operating profit increased in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was relatively consistent in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. The increases in operating profit were primarily due to higher net sales driven by market growth and new product introductions, coupled with lower royalty expense as a result of agreements we entered into in 2023 to acquire intellectual property through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements. However, operating profit as a percentage of net sales did not similarly increase and remained relatively consistent due to investments in instruments to support new product introductions and higher bad debt-related charges in the current year periods. 
 
 EMEA 
 In EMEA, operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. The increases were due to higher net sales driven by market growth and improved pricing, lower excess and obsolete inventory charges, reduced royalty expense as a result of agreements we entered into in 2023 to acquire intellectual property through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements, and lower expenses driven by our 2023 Restructuring Plan and cost savings initiatives. 
 
 Asia Pacific 
 In Asia Pacific, operating profit and operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same prior year periods. The increases were due to higher net sales driven by market growth and improved pricing, reduced royalty expense as a result of agreements we entered into in 2023 to acquire intellectual property through the buyout of certain licensing arrangements, and lower expenses driven by our 2023 Restructuring Plan and cost savings initiatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 569.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had 1.0 billion available to borrow under our 2024 364-Day Credit Agreement, and 1.5 billion available under our 2024 Five-Year Revolving Facility. The terms of the 2024 364-Day Credit Agreement and the 2024 Five-Year Revolving Facility are described further in Note 8 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 
 We believe that cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, it is possible our needs may change. Further, there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were 993.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 993.2 million in the same prior year period. The 2024 period featured higher bonus, income tax and restructuring-related payments as well as lower accounts receivable collections due to delayed invoicing from our U.S. and Canada ERP implementation. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower inventory investments in the 2024 period when compared to the 2023 period. 
 Cash flows used in investing activities were 596.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 558.1 million in the same prior year period. Instrument and property, plant and equipment additions reflected ongoing investments in our product portfolio, including new product introductions, optimization of our manufacturing and logistics networks, and investments in enterprise resource planning software. The decline in property, plant and equipment additions was driven by lower enterprise resource planning software spend as that project is getting implemented, in addition to the prior year period including investment in a corporate aircraft which did not recur in the current year period. In addition, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we entered into agreements to acquire the ownership rights or gain access to various technologies that were recognized as intangible assets, acquired three businesses and invested in a debt security. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities were 243.9 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 512.1 million in the same prior year period. In the 2024 period, we issued senior notes for 700.0 million and used the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to repurchase 795.8 million of our common stock and repay a net 50.0 million under our Uncommitted Credit Facility. In the 2023 period, we used cash on hand to repurchase 281.9 million of our common stock. We also repaid a net 20.0 million on our various revolving credit facilities and 120.2 million of other debt obligations that were due in the first quarter of 2023. 
 We place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 415.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Of this amount, 64.6 million is denominated in U.S. Dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. The remaining amount is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate. We generally intend to limit distributions from foreign subsidiaries earnings that were previously taxed in the U.S., as a result of the transition tax or tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI ). These previously taxed earnings would not be subject to further U.S. federal tax. 
 Our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. Substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country-specific variables. 
 Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations 
 At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt of 6,450.7 million, of which 1,713.0 million was classified as current debt. Of our current debt, 850.0 million of senior notes mature on November 22, 2024 and 863.0 million of senior notes mature on April 1, 2025. We believe we can satisfy these debt obligations with cash generated from our operations, by issuing new debt and/or by borrowing on our committed revolving credit facilities. 
 32 

For additional information on our debt, including types of debt, maturity dates, interest rates, debt covenants and available revolving credit facilities, see Note 8 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 In February, May and August 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.24 per share. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. 
 In May 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a 2.0 billion share repurchase program effective May 29, 2024, with no expiration date. As of September 30, 2024, 1,308.1 million remained authorized under the May 2024 program. Between October 1, 2024 and October 9, 2024, we repurchased an additional 0.6 million shares for 58.1 million, resulting in 1,250.0 million remaining authorized under the May 2024 program as of October 9, 2024. We used cash on hand to fund these repurchases. 
 As discussed in Note 4 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, we are executing on a 2023 Restructuring Plan, a 2021 Restructuring Plan and a 2019 Restructuring Plan. The 2023 Restructuring Plan along with other related initiatives is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of 120 million to 135 million by the end of 2025, of which approximately 110 million was incurred through September 30, 2024. We expect to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by 175 million to 200 million relative to the 2023 baseline expenses by the end of 2025 as program benefits under the 2023 Restructuring Plan are realized. The 2021 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately 173 million by the end of 2024, of which approximately 171 million was incurred through September 30, 2024. We expect to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately 190 million relative to the 2021 baseline expenses by the end of 2024 as program benefits under the 2021 Restructuring Plan are realized. The 2019 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately 400 million by the end of 2025, of which approximately 348 million was incurred through September 30, 2024. In our original estimates, we expected to reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately 180 million to 280 million relative to the 2019 baseline expenses by the end of 2023 as benefits under the 2019 Restructuring Plan were realized. Our latest estimates indicate that we will be near the low end of that range, and the full benefits will not be realized until we complete the closure of a manufacturing facility, which is expected to occur in 2025. 
 As discussed in Note 12 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the IRS has issued proposed adjustments for years 2013 through 2015 and for years 2016 through 2019. We have disputed these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to vigorously defend our positions. Although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows. 
 As discussed in Note 15 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, we are involved in various litigation matters. We estimate the total liabilities for all litigation matters was 155.3 million as of September 30, 2024. However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and upon resolution of any of these uncertainties, we may incur charges in excess of these estimates, and may in the future incur other material judgments or enter into other material settlements of claims. We expect to pay these liabilities over the next few years. Additionally, we have entered into development, distribution and other contractual arrangements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product R D milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, maintenance of exclusive rights to distribute a product. Since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, they have not been recognized on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. These estimated payments could range from 0 to approximately 320 million. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Information pertaining to recent accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 2 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements is affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods, and also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. There were no changes in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 to our critical accounting estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain detailed discussions of these and other important factors under the heading Risk Factors. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. Consequently, you should not consider any list or discussion of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. 
 Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we expressly disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. 
 Readers of this report are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements since there can be no assurance that these forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate. This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There have been no material changes from the information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. In July 2024 we transitioned to a new ERP software system for a significant portion of our U.S. and Canada sales and commercial operations (the "ERP implementation"). The new ERP replaced our existing order entry, fulfillment and financial systems, resulting in material changes to our business processes and internal controls. This ERP implementation included changes to certain financial and commercial processes impacting key controls related to our internal controls over financial reporting. We have implemented and/or enhanced our internal control activities, where applicable, for any changes that occurred and will continue to monitor the impact on our processes, procedures, and internal control over financial reporting going forward. Except as it relates to our ERP implementation, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II Oth er Information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Information pertaining to legal proceedings can be found in Note 15 to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 You should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K and the factors discussed below, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described in our 2023 Form 10-K and below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The following risk factor is added to the " Risk Factors " section of our 2023 Form 10-K: 
 Challenges in the transition of certain of our enterprise resource planning ("ERP") systems have adversely affected our business and operations, and may have further adverse effects. 
 As a result of technology initiatives, changes in our system platforms and the ongoing integration of business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the ERP systems that we operate. At the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal 2024, we began transitioning certain distribution and sales systems in the Americas to a new ERP system, as part of this multi-year effort. We experienced challenges in the transition during the third quarter of 2024 which caused operational challenges in fulfilling customer orders. Some disruptions and delays associated with these ERP transition challenges may continue through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although we believe we have identified the root causes of the ERP-related challenges and have developed appropriate plans to remediate these challenges, there can be no assurance that we will remediate all of our ERP-related challenges successfully and in a timely manner, or that other challenges will not arise. 
 These ERP-related business interruptions caused several adverse consequences, including disruption to our ability to distribute product, difficulty in meeting customer demand, and delays in invoicing customers. These unanticipated ERP-related challenges have caused the transition to the new ERP system to be more expensive and time-consuming than we anticipated. In addition, some customers affected by these disruptions may have secured supply from alternative sources, and we must regain their trust and business. We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in productivity as our personnel continue to remediate issues in our new ERP system and related processes. Continuing disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design, and implementation of our ERP system, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
