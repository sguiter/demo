See Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. 
 Pratt Whitney Powder Metal Matter. In 2023, Pratt Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G-JM (PW1100) Geared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the Powder Metal Matter ). See Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. 
 Russia Sanctions. In response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. As a result of the Canadian government s imposition of sanctions in February 2024, including those imposed on U.S.- and German-based Russian-owned entities from which we source titanium for use in our Canadian operations, we recorded charges of million in the first quarter of 2024 within our Collins segment. These charges are primarily related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources. We continue to monitor developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers.

 The computation of diluted earnings per share (EPS) excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock appreciation rights and stock options, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock awards during the period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential release or exercise of stock awards when the awards assumed proceeds exceed the average market price of the common shares during the period. There were stock awards excluded from the computation for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and the number of stock awards excluded from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the number of stock awards excluded from the computation was million and million, respectively. All outstanding stock awards are excluded in the computation of diluted EPS in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 because their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations.

 During the third quarter of 2024, we received a critical license required to restart work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer. In order to perform under these contracts, significant actions are required, including obtaining additional regulatory approvals, and therefore we have not recognized revenue on these contracts to date. As of September 30, 2024, our Contract liabilities include approximately million of advance payments received in connection with these contracts, which may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated.

and , respectively, as compared to and for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The change in the effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, is driven in part by the billion Powder Metal Matter charge and the associated deferred tax benefit of million recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a million deferred tax benefit associated with legal entity reorganizations and a million tax benefit in response to favorable U.S. Tax Court rulings issued to unrelated taxpayers, but with facts similar to ours. The nature of the tax item in the rulings is subject to a tax matters agreement entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the separation of those businesses in 2020, and therefore we recorded a pre-tax charge of million for their respective indemnified amounts. 
 The quarter ended September 30, 2024 also includes a million tax charge related to U.S. federal income taxes now owed by the Company resulting from a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling Otis received in the quarter impacting pre-separation tax years. This tax ruling results in a reduction of U.S. foreign tax credits previously claimed by the Company in pre-separation tax years for which Otis must indemnify us. The Company recorded a pre-tax benefit of million representing a portion of the indemnity owed by Otis pursuant to the tax matters agreement and will record the remaining amount owed upon receipt. Additionally, the Company is indemnified for associated interest of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition to items described above, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a million tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2024 resulting from the conclusion of the examination phases of the U.S. federal income tax audits for RTX 2017 and 2018 tax years and Rockwell Collins 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years, a million tax cost associated with the sale of the CIS business, and the effective tax rate impact of the million charge associated with the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters accrued during the second quarter of 2024 where no tax benefit has been recorded. 
 We conduct business globally and, as a result, RTX or one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2014. 
 The Company filed protests with respect to certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed adjustments for RTX (formerly United Technologies Corporation) tax years 2017 and 2018, pre-acquisition Rockwell Collins tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018, and pre-merger Raytheon Company tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019 as well as certain refund claims of Raytheon Company for

 Other accrued liabilities Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current Other accrued liabilities 
 The effect of cash flow hedging relationships on Accumulated other comprehensive loss and on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations in the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented in Note 17: Equity. The amounts of gain or loss are attributable to foreign exchange contract activity and are primarily recorded as a component of Products sales when reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 The Company utilizes the critical terms match method in assessing derivatives for hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, the hedged items and derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our million principal value of euro-denominated long-term debt qualifies as a net investment hedge against our investments in European businesses, which is deemed to be effective. 
 The effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included within Other income (expense), net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and is not significant.

Pratt Whitney holds a program share interest and a ownership interest in IAE LLC. IAE and IAE LLC retain limited equity with the primary economics of the programs passed to the participants. As such, we have determined that IAE and IAE LLC are variable interest entities with Pratt Whitney as the primary beneficiary. IAE and IAE LLC have, therefore, been consolidated. Other collaborators participate in Pratt Whitney s program share interest in IAE and IAE LLC. Pratt Whitney s net program share interest in

Third party guarantees 
 We have made residual value and other guarantees related to various commercial aerospace customer financing arrangements. The estimated fair market values of the guaranteed assets equal or exceed the value of the related guarantees, net of existing reserves. Collaboration partners share of these financing guarantees were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax, and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount, as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These primarily relate to environmental liabilities, which are included in our total environmental liabilities as further discussed in Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies. 
 We accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. 
 We also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant.

 billion reserved for environmental remediation. 
 Commercial Aerospace Financing and Other Commitments. We had commercial aerospace financing commitments and other contractual commitments of approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements. We may also lease aircraft and subsequently sublease the aircraft to customers under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, or pay deposits on behalf of our customers to secure production slots with the airframers (pre-delivery payments). Our financing commitments with customers are contingent upon maintenance of certain levels of financial condition by our customers. Associated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral, and the credit worthiness of our customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is expected to equal the amounts funded. 
 We also have other contractual commitments to make payments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. The estimated amount and timing of these payments are generally based on future sales or engine flight hours. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit. We have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaboration partners in these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce s ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments are capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made. 
 Other Financing Arrangements. We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention, and advance payment obligations for us or our affiliates. We enter into these agreements to assist certain affiliates in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. The stated values of these letters of credit agreements and surety bonds totaled billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 Offset / Industrial Participation Obligations. We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset agreements or ICIP agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of these agreements, both agreed to and anticipated to be agreed to, had an outstanding notional value of approximately billion. These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities, or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training, and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. Historically, we have not been required to pay any penalties of significance. 
 Government Oversight. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries and our properties are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal

 billion, reflecting Pratt Whitney s net program share of the PW1100 program. This amount reflected our best estimate of expected customer compensation for the estimated duration of the disruption as well as the EAC adjustment impact of this matter to Pratt Whitney s long-term maintenance contracts. The incremental costs to the business s long-term maintenance contracts include the estimated cost of additional inspections, replacement of parts, and other related impacts. 
 The charge recorded in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a net increase in Other accrued liabilities of billion, which principally related to our share of an accrual for expected customer compensation. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had Other accrued liabilities of billion and billion, respectively, primarily related to expected compensation to customers. The decrease in the accrual during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to customer compensation. 
 Other engine models within Pratt Whitney s fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal, but we do not currently believe there will be any resultant significant financial impact with respect to these other engine models at this time. The financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical experience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, most notably, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers. While these assumptions reflect our best estimates at this time, they are subject to variability. Potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the Company s results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized. 
 Legal Proceedings. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various contract pricing disputes, government investigations, and litigation matters across jurisdictions, updates to certain of which are set forth below. 
 Cost Accounting Standards Claims 
 As previously disclosed, in April 2019, a Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer (DACO) of the United States DCMA asserted a claim against Pratt Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately billion plus interest billion at September 30, 2024). The claim is based on Pratt Whitney s alleged noncompliance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) from January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2019, due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts. Pratt Whitney believes that the claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the ASBCA on June 7, 2019. On September 30, 2024, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt Whitney that similarly alleges that Pratt Whitney was noncompliant with CAS due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts from April 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023. The second claim demands payment of billion plus interest million at September 30, 2024 ). Pratt Whitney believes the second claim is without merit and will file an appeal to the ASBCA. 
 As previously disclosed, in December 2013, a DCMA DACO asserted a claim against Pratt Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately million plus interest million at September 30, 2024). The claim is based on Pratt Whitney s alleged noncompliance with CAS from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, due to its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts used in the calculation of material overhead costs for government contracts. In 2014, Pratt Whitney filed an appeal to the ASBCA. An evidentiary hearing was held and completed in June 2019. On November 22, 2021, the ASBCA issued its written decision sustaining in part and denying in part Pratt Whitney s appeal. The ASBCA rejected the DCMA s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts, and ruled substantially in Pratt Whitney s favor on other liability issues. The ASBCA remanded the appeal to the parties for resolution of damages issues, which could require further proceedings at the ASBCA. On December 23, 2021, the DCMA filed a motion with the ASBCA seeking partial reconsideration of the November 22, 2021 decision. The motion for reconsideration was denied on August 29, 2022. On December 23, 2022, the DCMA filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to believe that the ASBCA s rejection of the DCMA s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts is well supported in fact and law and likely will be sustained. In December 2018, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2013 through 2017. This second claim, which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator parts rejected by the ASBCA s November 22, 2021 decision, demands payment of million plus interest million at September 30, 2024). Pratt Whitney appealed this second claim to the ASBCA in January 2019. In December 2023, a DCMA DACO issued a third claim against Pratt Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2018 through 2022. This third claim, which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator parts rejected by the ASBCA s prior decision, demands payment of million plus interest million at September 30,

 million. In addition, the SEC s administrative order issued in connection with the administrative proceeding settlement alleged that Raytheon Company violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The order provides for a million payment to the SEC that includes disgorgement, prejudgment interest on disgorgement, and a civil penalty. Under DPA-1, the SEC s administrative order, and DPA-2 discussed in DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes below, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain an independent compliance monitor(s) satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations for a three-year term. The compliance monitor(s) will oversee Raytheon Company s and the Company s compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, the SEC s administrative order, and DPA-2 discussed in DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes below. The Company has accrued million in the aggregate for DPA-1 and the SEC s administrative order as of September 30, 2024, which will be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes 
 As previously disclosed, on October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company since 2009. The investigation involved multi-year contracts subject to governmental regulation, including defective pricing claims for certain Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013. As part of the same investigation, on March 24, 2021, the Company received a second criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking documents relating to a certain contract entered into in 2017 by Raytheon Company. As previously disclosed on July 25, 2024, following the government s and the Company s own internal investigations, the Company engaged in resolution discussions with the DOJ, and during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the DOJ as to the principal elements of such resolution. In addition, the Company cooperated with the DOJ with respect to a related civil defective pricing investigation under the False Claims Act (FCA). On October 16, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into a DPA (DPA-2) and an FCA settlement agreement (FCA Settlement Agreement) with the DOJ to resolve these matters. Pursuant to DPA-2, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to two counts of major fraud against the United States by Raytheon Company involving two legacy contracts. If Raytheon Company and the Company fully comply with all of their respective obligations in DPA-2 during its three-year term, the DOJ will move for dismissal with prejudice of the deferred charges against Raytheon Company. DPA-2 provides for a criminal penalty in the amount of million, plus restitution, and the FCA Settlement Agreement provides for an FCA settlement payment in the amount of million plus interest million at September 30, 2024), which includes restitution that will satisfy the criminal restitution obligation when paid. Under DPA-2 as well as DPA-1 and the SEC administrative order discussed in Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters above, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain an independent compliance monitor(s) satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure

 million in the aggregate for DPA-2 and the FCA Settlement Agreement as of September 30, 2024, which will be paid during the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company does not believe that these matters, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 Trade Compliance Matters 
 From time to time, we identify, investigate, remediate, and voluntarily disclose violations or potential violations of the ITAR and EAR to the relevant regulators. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of State s (DOS) Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (DTCC) informed the Company of its intent to seek administrative penalties for alleged violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The DTCC informed us that it considers certain of our voluntary disclosures, primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, filed since 2019 to reflect deficiencies warranting a civil penalty. On August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve these matters. The CA settles certain AECA and ITAR compliance matters with the DTCC and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The CA has a three-year term and provides for: (i) a civil penalty of million, million of which is suspended on the condition that such amount is applied to DTCC-approved remedial compliance measures; (ii) the appointment of an external Special Compliance Officer to oversee compliance with the CA, the AECA, and the ITAR; (iii) an external audit of the Company s AECA and ITAR compliance program; and (iv) implementation of additional remedial compliance measures related to AECA and ITAR compliance. The million portion of the settlement that is not subject to suspension, which was accrued by the Company in the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, will be paid in installments, with million paid in September 2024, million paid by August 29, 2025, and million paid by August 29, 2026. As previously disclosed, the Company has determined that there is a probable risk of liability for potential penalties related to other export compliance matters which have been voluntarily disclosed to the cognizant regulators, but which are not subject to the CA. We have accrued million in the aggregate as of September 30, 2024 for these matters and the matters being resolved pursuant to the CA. We are currently unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the other voluntarily disclosed export compliance matters that are not subject to the CA. However, the Company does not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 UTC Equity Conversion Litigation 
 As previously disclosed, on December 6, 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain current and former members of its Board of Directors, alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in May 2020 by amending the method by which United Technologies Corporation (UTC) equity awards were converted to certain Company equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly traded companies. On July 23, 2024, in response to a motion to dismiss filed by the Company, the Court dismissed the shareholder derivative lawsuit in its entirety with prejudice. On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. We continue to believe that the lawsuit lacks merit. We also continue to believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 Civil Litigation Related to Employee Hiring Practices 
 Pratt Whitney is one of multiple defendants in a putative class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that Pratt Whitney and the other defendants agreed to restrict the hiring and recruiting of certain engineers and skilled laborers in a manner that violated federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs seek to represent different purported classes of engineers and skilled laborers employed by Pratt Whitney and other supplier-defendants since 2011, and are seeking to recover treble damages in an undetermined amount, plus attorneys fees and costs of suit. On August 30, 2024, Pratt Whitney filed a notice with the court that the parties have reached agreement in principle to settle Plaintiffs claims on a class-wide basis for an immaterial amount. 
 In April 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors of the Company alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to implement and enforce a reasonable oversight mechanism for compliance with antitrust laws. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
 Powder Metal Disclosure Litigation and SEC Investigation 
 Following the Company s disclosures of a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain Pratt Whitney engine parts, two sets of civil actions were filed against RTX. First, two putative federal securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Company and certain current and former executives of the Company. The lawsuits allege that defendants violated federal securities laws by making material misstatements and

billion. The ASR agreements provided for the repurchase of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of such ASR agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreement. Pursuant to the ASR agreements, we made aggregate payments of billion on October 26, 2023, and received initial deliveries of approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share, which, on that date, represented approximately 85 of the shares expected to be repurchased. The aggregate purchase price was recorded as a reduction to Shareowners equity, consisting of an billion increase in Treasury stock and a billion decrease in Common stock. 
 The shares associated with the remaining portion of the aggregate purchase price have been settled over two tranches. In July 2024, the first tranche was settled upon final delivery to us of approximately million shares of common stock. In September 2024, with respect to the second tranche, we owed approximately million shares of common stock that we elected to cash settle for million. The cash payment required as a result of the second tranche settlement was due to the significant increase in the price of our common stock during the ASR term. The final average price under the ASR was per share.

 We disaggregate our contracts from customers by geographic region based on customer location, by type of customer, and by sales type. Our geographic region based on customer location uses end user customer location where known or practical to determine, or in instances where the end user customer is not known or not practical to determine, uses ship to location as the customer location. In addition, for our Raytheon segment, we disaggregate our contracts from customers by contract type. We believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

 With respect to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of RTX for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) reported that it has applied limited procedures in accordance with professional standards for a review of such information. However, its report dated October 22, 2024, appearing below, states that the firm did not audit and does not express an opinion on that unaudited condensed consolidated financial information. PwC has not carried out any significant or additional audit tests beyond those that would have been necessary if their report had not been included. Accordingly, the degree of reliance on its report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures applied. PwC is not subject to the liability provisions of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act) for its report on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information because that report is not a report or a part of a registration statement prepared or certified by PwC within the meaning of Sections 7 and 11 of the Act.

 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of RTX Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2024, and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), and of changes in equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity, and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 5, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 We are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms we, our, us, the Company, and RTX mean RTX Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
 Raytheon follows a 4-4-5 fiscal calendar while Collins Aerospace (Collins) and Pratt Whitney use a quarter calendar end. Throughout this Form 10-Q, when we refer to the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 with respect to Raytheon, we are referring to their September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 fiscal quarter ends, respectively. 
 The current status of significant factors affecting our business environment in 2024 is discussed below. For additional discussion, refer to the Business Overview section in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Industry Considerations 
 Our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture, or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. 
 Government legislation, policies, and regulations can impact our business and operations. Changes in environmental and climate change-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. In addition, government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government imposed travel restrictions, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses. 
 Collins and Pratt Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles, and the general economic health of airline carriers and airframers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. In particular, the ongoing work stoppages at a major airframer customer, may adversely impact our business. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. Many of our aerospace customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins and Pratt Whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services. 
 Our defense operations are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities, the domestic and global political and economic environment, and the evolving nature of the global and national security threat environment. In addition, our defense businesses engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in these budget and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to U.S. domestic and foreign geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions, or other restrictions. Refer to U.S. Government s Continuing Resolution below for additional information. 
 Other Matters 
 Global, economic, and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices and supply, labor availability and costs, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical conflicts and strained intercountry relations, U.S. and non-U.S. tax law changes, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and supply, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses. 
 Legal Matters. The Company has resolved several outstanding legal matters, herein referred to as Resolution of Certain Legal Matters. The Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and 
 32

 Related Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). In addition, the Company resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a consent agreement with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). As a result, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of 918 million during the second quarter of 2024, which included an accrual of 269 million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), an accrual of 364 million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and an accrual of 285 million related to Trade Compliance Matters. See Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Pratt Whitney Powder Metal Matter. As described further in Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies, within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, in 2023, Pratt Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G-JM (PW1100) Geared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the Powder Metal Matter ). 
 Global Supply Chain. We are dependent on a global supply chain and in recent years have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs which adversely affected our performance. These disruptions impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities on a timely basis and/or at expected prices, and have been driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, continue to contribute to these issues. Furthermore, our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by these same issues. As a result of the Canadian government s imposition of sanctions in February 2024, including those imposed on U.S.- and German-based Russian-owned entities from which we source titanium for use in our Canadian operations, we recorded charges of 175 million in the first quarter of 2024 within our Collins segment. These charges are primarily related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources. We have implemented actions and programs to mitigate some of the impacts but anticipate supply chain disruptions to continue. 
 Economic Environment. High inflation levels have increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs and have negatively impacted our operating profit and margin, including the impact on productivity expectations. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we are not always able to offset cost increases by increasing our contract value or pricing, in particular on our fixed-price contracts. Increasing material, component, and labor prices could subject us to losses in our fixed price contracts in the event of cost overruns. In addition, higher interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing and tightened the availability of capital. Among other things, these effects can constrain our customers purchasing power and decrease orders for our products and services and impact the ability of our customers to make payments and of our suppliers to perform. Moreover, volatility in interest rates and financial markets can lead to economic uncertainty, an economic downturn or recession and impact the demand for our products and services as well as our supply chain. We continue to pursue strategic and operational initiatives to help address these macroeconomic pressures, including our digital transformation, operational modernization, cost reduction, and advanced technology programs, and we apply our Customer Oriented Results Excellence (CORE) operating platform to the execution of these initiatives. However, the impact of these pressures and corresponding initiatives is uncertain and subject to a range of factors and future developments. 
 U.S. Government s Continuing Resolution. On September 26, 2024, President Biden signed a continuing resolution that funds federal agencies through December 20, 2024. A continuing resolution authorizes federal agencies to operate generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but typically does not authorize new spending initiatives during this period. If Congress is unable to enact formal fiscal year 2025 appropriation bills by December 20, 2024, it may pass another continuing resolution. However, if Congress fails to pass the formal appropriations bills or a continuing resolution, then the U.S. government would shut down during which federal agencies would cease all non-essential functions. 
 In the event of a U.S. government shutdown, our business, program performance and results of operations could be impacted by the resulting disruptions to federal government offices, workers, and operations, including risks relating to the funding of certain programs, stop work orders, as well as delays in contract awards, new program starts, payments for work performed, and other actions. We also may experience similar impacts in the event of an extended period of continuing resolutions. Generally, the significance of these impacts will primarily be based on the length of the continuing resolution or shutdown. Furthermore, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which imposes limits on discretionary spending for defense and non-defense programs in exchange for the lifting of the debt ceiling in June 2023, if Congress fails to enact appropriation bills by April 30,

 2025, then the budget caps will be reduced and corresponding automatic reductions to agency budget accounts will be enforced through sequestration. 
 Geopolitical Matters. In response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers, including as discussed above in Global Supply Chain; however, based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We will continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers. 
 In February 2023, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missiles Defense (RMD) (a former RTX Corporation (RTX) business segment which became part of Raytheon during the third quarter of 2023), and previously announced it may take measures against RTX, in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. The Chinese sanctions against RMD included a fine equal to twice the value of the arms that RMD sold to Taiwan since September 2020. In addition, in September 2022, China indicated that it decided to sanction our Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Gregory Hayes, in connection with another foreign military sale to Taiwan involving RTX products and services. In January 2024, China announced sanctions against Data Link Solutions LLC, a Collins joint venture and, most recently, in May 2024, China announced sanctions against Raytheon Missile Systems and the Javelin Joint Venture between Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. If China were to impose additional sanctions, enforce announced sanctions, or take other regulatory action against RTX, our suppliers, affiliates, or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. Any impact of these or other potential sanctions or other actions by China is uncertain. 
 We have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval has been pending. The U.S. government s approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. Likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. In addition, certain programs require approvals by foreign governments, and those approvals may not be obtained on a timely basis or at all or may be revoked. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. In particular, during the third quarter of 2024, we received a critical license required to restart work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer. In order to perform under these contracts, significant actions are required, including obtaining additional regulatory approvals, and therefore we have not recognized revenue on these contracts to date. Should the remaining uncertainties be resolved, we do not expect these contracts to have a significant impact on our future financial results. As of September 30, 2024, our Contract liabilities include approximately 430 million of advance payments received in connection with these contracts, which may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated . 
 We continue to closely monitor potential impacts from the war in Gaza and the recent escalation of conflict in the region on RTX s business, customers, suppliers, employees, and operations in Israel, the Middle East, and elsewhere. To date, the impacts to RTX have been minimal, though a number of countries have imposed restrictions on exports to or imports from Israel. RTX s commercial manufacturing facilities in Israel remain open and operational and have continued exporting products and importing critical items and raw materials. RTX s defense programs ability to receive components from Israel has not been impacted in any material respect, though we could experience future delivery delays of certain products because of the current situation. Given the volatile nature of the situation, the potential impacts to RTX are subject to change. 
 See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these items. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. See Critical Accounting Estimates within Item 7 and Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles within Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual

 results in these areas could differ from management s estimates. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 As described in our Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results of this Form 10-Q, our interim period results of operations and period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context. 
 We provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit for our segments. We believe that these non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales, and Operating profit excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily related to our Raytheon segment. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.

 Other Income (Expense), Net Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other income (expense), net 134 3 (390) 116 
 Other income (expense), net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other ongoing and non-recurring items. 
 The increase in Other income (expense), net of 0.1 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a 0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a net unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange gains and losses. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense. 
 The decrease in Other income (expense), net of 0.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a 0.9 billion charge during the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters, the absence of a gain on the sale of land during the first quarter of 2023, and the reversal of certain tax related indemnity receivables associated with the conclusion of the examination phase of certain tax audits in the first quarter of 2024. The above items were partially offset by a 0.4 billion gain on the sale of Raytheon s CIS business, net of transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2024 and a 0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense.

 Operating Profit (Loss) Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating profit (loss) 2,028 (1,396) 4,427 1,784 Operating profit (loss) margin 10.1 (10.4) 7.5 3.6 
 The increase in Operating profit (loss) of 3.4 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the absence of the 2.9 billion of charges associated with the Powder Metal Matter recorded in the third quarter of 2023, the increased operating performance of our segments of approximately 0.4 billion, and a 0.2 billion benefit related to an indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense. 
 The increase in Operating profit (loss) of 2.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the absence of the 2.9 billion of charges associated with the Powder Metal Matter in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, the increase in Operating profit was driven by the increased operating performance of our segments of approximately 1.0 billion, a 0.4 billion gain on sale of the CIS business recorded in the first quarter of 2024, net of transaction and other related costs, and a 0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The above items were partially offset by a 0.9 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters, a 0.6 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination, and the change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment which is described below in Segment Review.

 Income Taxes Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Effective income tax rate 19.5 29.4 17.5 9.2 
 The change in the effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, is driven in part by the 2.9 billion Powder Metal Matter charge and the associated deferred tax benefit of 663 million recorded in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a 138 million deferred tax benefit associated with legal entity reorganizations and a 56 million tax benefit in response to favorable U.S. Tax Court rulings issued to unrelated taxpayers, but with facts similar to ours. The nature of the tax item in the rulings is subject to a tax matters agreement entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the separation of those businesses in 2020, and therefore we recorded a pre-tax charge of 32 million for their respective indemnified amounts. 
 The quarter ended September 30, 2024 also includes a 212 million tax charge related to U.S. federal income taxes now owed by the Company resulting from a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling Otis received in the quarter impacting pre-separation tax years. This tax ruling results in a reduction of U.S. foreign tax credits previously claimed by the Company in pre-separation tax years for which Otis must indemnify us. The Company currently expects to receive approximately 300 million from Otis in connection with the reduction to the foreign tax credits claimed and resulting indemnification obligation. The Company recorded a pre-tax benefit of 212 million representing a portion of the indemnity owed by Otis pursuant to the tax matters agreement and will record the remaining amount owed upon receipt. Additionally, the Company is indemnified for associated interest of 31 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition to items described above, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a 275 million tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2024 resulting from the conclusion of the examination phases of the U.S. federal income tax audits for RTX 2017 and 2018 tax years and Rockwell Collins 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years, a 143 million tax cost associated with the sale of the CIS business, and the effective tax rate impact of the 918 million charge associated with the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters accrued during the second quarter of 2024 where no tax benefit has been recorded.

 SEGMENT REVIEW 
 Our operations, for the periods presented herein, are classified into three principal segments: Collins, Pratt Whitney, and Raytheon. Segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. Segment Total net sales and Operating profit include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below. 
 Given the nature of our business, we believe that total net sales and operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management s view of our segment performance, as described below. 
 We provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in Results of Operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt Whitney s overall operating results. 
 Total Net Sales. Total net sales by segment were as follows:

 (3) Includes a 0.6 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination and a 0.4 billion gain, net of transaction and other related costs, in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of our CIS business. See Note 5: Changes in Contract Estimates at Completion and Note 2: Acquisitions and Dispositions within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q, respectively, for additional information. 
 (4) Includes a 0.9 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters. See Note 1: Basis of Presentation within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Included in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to Note 5: Changes in Contract Estimates at Completion within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts, and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis, and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course. 
 We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented: Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Gross favorable 260 247 803 851 Gross unfavorable (351) (526) (1,118) (1,284) Total net EAC adjustments (91) (279) (315) (433) 
 The change in net EAC adjustments of 0.2 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of a 0.1 billion unfavorable impact recorded at Pratt Whitney in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter. 
 The change in net EAC adjustments of 0.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to favorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt Whitney, as discussed above, and Raytheon, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Collins. 
 In addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer. As a result of this action, Raytheon recognized a 0.6 billion charge related to the estimated impact of this termination. This charge includes the write-off of remaining contract assets and our best estimate of the expected settlement in conjunction with this termination. 
 Significant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment s discussion below. 
 Backlog and Bookings. Total backlog was 221 billion and 196 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total backlog includes commercial backlog of 131 billion and 118 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and defense backlog of 90 billion and 78 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Raytheon backlog was reduced by 1.1 billion as a result of the sale of the CIS business.

 We believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately 25 billion and 12 billion for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately 47 billion and 37 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period, which are subject to numerous factors, including: the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs, customer budgets and other fiscal constraints, political and economic and other environmental factors, the timing of customer negotiations, and the timing of customer and governmental approvals and notifications. In addition, due to these factors, quarterly bookings tend to fluctuate from period to period, particularly on a segment basis.

 The organic net sales increase of 0.4 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to higher defense sales of 0.3 billion due to higher volume across multiple programs and higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of 0.2 billion principally driven by continued growth in commercial air traffic, which has resulted in an increase in flight hours and increased volume. This increase was partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of 0.1 billion driven by lower volume on certain narrowbody aircraft. 
 The increase in Other net sales in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of a 0.1 billion charge related to a litigation matter in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The organic operating profit increase of 0.1 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher defense operating profit of 0.1 billion, principally driven by the higher sales volume discussed above. Commercial aerospace operating profit in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was relatively flat as higher commercial aftermarket volume was offset by the lower commercial OEM volume discussed above and unfavorable OEM mix. The organic operating profit increase was also partially offset by higher research and development costs. 
 The increase in Other operating profit in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of a charge related to the litigation matter discussed above.

 The organic net sales increase of 0.3 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher net sales of 0.4 billion from land and air defense systems programs driven by higher net sales on certain international Patriot programs, certain international National Advanced Surface-to-air Missile System (NASAMS) programs, and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) programs. Also contributing to the increases were higher net sales of 0.1 billion from advanced technology programs primarily driven by higher volume on classified

 programs and on an advanced development program. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of 0.2 billion from air and space defense systems programs primarily due to the completion of certain programs. 
 The organic operating profit increase of 0.1 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was driven by a favorable change in mix and other performance of approximately 40 million primarily due to increased production on international Patriot programs, an improvement in net EAC adjustments of approximately 30 million, and higher volume of approximately 30 million primarily driven by the net sales increases noted above. The change in net EAC adjustments was spread across numerous programs and included an unfavorable EAC adjustment of 53 million in the third quarter of 2024 related to cost increases on a classified program. 
 The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.

 The organic net sales increase of 1.0 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by higher net sales of 1.0 billion from land and air defense systems programs driven by higher net sales on certain international Patriot programs, C-UAS programs, certain international NASAMS programs, and the Stinger program. Also contributing to the increases were higher net sales of 0.4 billion from advanced technology programs primarily driven by higher volume on classified programs and on an advanced development program. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales of 0.4 billion from air and space defense systems programs primarily due to the completion of certain programs, and the timing of a prior year program award. 
 The organic operating profit increase of 0.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an improvement in net EAC adjustments of approximately 110 million and higher volume of approximately 100 million primarily driven by the net sales increases noted above. The change in net EAC adjustments was spread across numerous programs and benefited from the absence of a 51 million unfavorable adjustment in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to significant contract options exercised, which was offset by a 53 million unfavorable EAC adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 related to cost increases on a classified program. 
 The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024. 
 The Other net sales and operating profit decreases of 0.1 billion and 0.2 billion, respectively in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to an impact to net sales and operating profit of 0.1 billion and 0.6 billion, respectively, related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024, with the operating profit decrease partially offset by a 0.4 billion gain on the sale of the CIS business, net of transaction and other related costs, in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Defense Backlog and Bookings Backlog was 60 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 52 billion as of December 31, 2023. Included in the change in backlog was a 1.1 billion reduction related to the sale of the CIS business discussed above. In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Raytheon booked 1.9 billion for low-rate initial production (LRIP) of Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense System (LTAMDS) for the U.S. Army and Poland, 1.3 billion to provide Standard Missile III (SM-3) to the U.S. Navy and international customers, 1.2 billion to provide Patriot Air Defense systems to Germany, 1.2 billion to provide advanced medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM) to the U.S. Air Force and international customers, 737 million to provide AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and international customers, 599 million to provide Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T) for NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), 538 million to provide Javelin for the U.S. Army and international customers, 530 million to provide Patriot launchers for Poland, 526 million to provide Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and international consortium partners, 479 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, 473 million for Irst Capable Raptor Unrivaled Supremacy (ICARUS) production for the U. S. Air Force, 453 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, 272 million for Standard Missile II (SM-2) provisioned items and ordered spares for the U.S. Navy,

 and 1.2 billion on a number of classified contracts. In addition to these bookings, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Raytheon booked 1.2 billion to provide Patriot Air Defense systems to Germany, 818 million to provide GEM-T for NSPA, 639 million to produce AN/SPY-6(V) radars for the U.S. Navy, 623 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, 393 million to design and build the Landsat Next Instrument Suite (LandIS) for NASA, 282 million to provide NASAMS for Ukraine, 251 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer and 2.6 billion on a number of classified contracts. 
 
 Corporate and Eliminations and other 
 Eliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income, and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller operations. 
 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs not considered part of management s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance, including certain unallowable costs and reserves.

 The increase in eliminations and other net sales of 48 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins. 
 The change in eliminations and other operating profit of 55 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the absence of the impact of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notice issued in September 2023 related to the research and experimental expenditures capitalization. 
 The change in Corporate expenses and other unallocated items of 0.2 billion in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a 0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 11: Income Taxes within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense.

 The increase in eliminations and other net sales of 0.2 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins. 
 Eliminations and other operating profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively consistent with the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The change in Corporate expenses and other unallocated items of 0.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to a 0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024, as discussed above. 
 
 FAS/CAS operating adjustment 
 We present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB expense under the FAS requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government CAS, primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis .

 The changes in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of 0.1 billion and 0.2 billion in the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were driven by a decrease in CAS expense, primarily due to the recognition of historical CAS gain/loss experience. 
 
 Acquisition accounting adjustments 
 Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable. These adjustments are not considered part of management s evaluation of segment results .

 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 6,682 6,587 Total debt 42,156 43,827 Total equity 62,826 61,410 Total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) 104,982 105,237 Total debt to total capitalization 40 42 
 We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities and the timing of such activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 the commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt, and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 6.7 billion, of which approximatel y 30 was held by RTX s foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company intends to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTX will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. 
 Our ability to access global debt markets and the related cost of these borrowings depends on the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our S P Global credit rating remains at BBB+/negative, and our Moody s Investors Service outlook is Baa1/negative. Though the Company expects to continue having adequate access to funds, declines in our credit ratings or Company outlook could result in higher borrowing costs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to 5.0 billion, which expires in August 2028. As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. 
 From time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments, and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of September 30, 2024, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was 5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our 5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. At September 30, 2024, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
 We made the following repayments of long-term debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Date Description of Notes Aggregate Principal Balance (in millions) May 7, 2024 3 Month SOFR plus 1.225 Term Loan due 2025 
 250 April 17, 2024 3 Month SOFR plus 1.225 Term Loan due 2025 
 250 April 4, 2024 3 Month SOFR plus 1.225 Term Loan due 2025 
 250 March 15, 2024 3.200 notes due 2024

 We have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the SEC on September 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. 
 The Company offers voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers participation in the SCF programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the programs. In addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. As such, the SCF programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows, or overall liquidity. 
 We believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate. 
 
 Cash Flow - Operating Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash flows provided by operating activities 
 5,598 3,172 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and a 0.4 billion, net of tax, charge related to the anticipated Raytheon Contract Termination, both of which did not have a significant impact on cash flow in the period. These charges also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by 1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 included a 2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax, which had no effect on cash flow in that period. This charge also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by 2.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of these charges, the 3.0 billion change in cash flows provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was driven by a favorable impact from accounts receivable driven by increased sales volume and timing of collections, including the related impact of factoring as discussed below, a favorable change in accounts payable driven by timing of payments and an increase in material purchases, and lower tax payments year-over-year including a tax refund received in the second quarter of 2024. These favorable changes were partially offset by the net change in contract assets and contract liabilities due to the timing of collections, and a decrease in Other accrued liabilities due to utilization of the Powder Metal Matter accrual as a result of customer compensation. 
 The Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-parties to sell certain of its receivables, primarily related to customer facilitated programs. The activity in these agreements is generally dependent on underlying delivery volumes within our commercial OEM programs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, factoring activity resulted in an increase of approximately 0.9 billion in cash provided by operating activities, compared to an increase of approximately 0.4 billion in cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customer s request for which we may be compensated by the customer. 
 We made net tax payments of 0.6 billion and 1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 While the timing of cash flows are subject to a number of variables, for the Powder Metal Matter we estimate the accrual for expected customer compensation to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan, the period of increased aircraft on ground levels, and contractual terms with customers. We currently estimate a full year 2024 cash impact related to the Powder Metal Matter of approximately 1.0 billion. Additionally, we currently estimate full year 2024 cash payments of approximately 1.0 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and approximately 0.5 billion for the Raytheon Contract Termination executed subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flow - Investing Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash flows used in investing activities 
 (755) (2,061) 
 Our investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments. 
 The 1.3 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily related to the sale of our CIS business within our Raytheon segment for proceeds of approximately 1.3 billion in cash. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we increased other intangible assets by 0.4 billion and 0.5 billion, respectively, primarily related to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce s collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets. 
 
 Cash Flow - Financing Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash flows used in financing activities 
 (4,749) (1,909) 
 Our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends, and stock repurchases. 
 The 2.8 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by prior year long-term debt issuances of 3.0 billion, an increase in long-term debt repayments of 1.5 billion, and lower issuances of commercial paper, net, of 0.5 billion, partially offset by lower year-over-year share repurchases of 2.2 billion. Refer to Note 9: Borrowings and Lines of Credit within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on debt issuances and repayments and commercial paper. 
 At September 30, 2024, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately 0.7 billion of our common stock under the October 21, 2023 share repurchase program. Under the 2023 program, shares may be purchased on the open market,

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the Corporate Vice President and Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO, and Controller concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO, and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Pursuant to SEC regulations, for proceedings under environmental laws to which a government authority is a party and we reasonably believe such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of 1 million. 
 Environmental Enforcement Proceeding 
 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) issued a Notice of Violation/Cease and Desist Order (NOV/CDO) to Raytheon Company on January 31, 2023, alleging violations of a water discharge permit at a former Raytheon Company facility in Boulder, Colorado. On March 27, 2024, the CDPHE informed Raytheon Company that it is seeking a penalty in the amount of approximately 1 million in connection with the alleged violations and is requiring us to undertake a compliance program. Raytheon Company is contesting the alleged violations and the penalty demand, and has the right to

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The following table provides information about our purchases of equity securities that are registered by us pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 2024 Total Number of Shares Purchased (000 s) Average Price Paid per Share (dollars) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of a Publicly Announced Program (000 s) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program (dollars in millions) July 1 - July 31 (1) 
 527 106.81 391 976 August 1 - August 31 126 118.90 976 September 1 - September 30 (2) 
 715 Total 653 112.63 391 
 (1) Total Number of Shares Purchased and Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of a Publicly Announced Program include approximately 0.4 million shares received from the settlement of the first tranche of the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. 
 (2) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program includes the cash settlement from the second tranche of the ASR agreement. 
 On October 21, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 11 billion of our common stock, replacing the previous program announced on December 12, 2022. Under the 2023 program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 On October 24, 2023, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements with certain financial institution counterparties to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 10 billion. The ASR agreements provided for the repurchase of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of such ASR agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreement. Pursuant to the ASR agreements, we made aggregate payments of 10 billion on October 26, 2023, and received initial deliveries of approximately 108.4 million shares of our common stock at a price of 78.38 per share, which, on that date, represented approximately 85 of the shares expected to be repurchased. The aggregate purchase price was recorded as a reduction to Shareowners equity, consisting of an 8.5 billion increase in Treasury stock and a 1.5 billion decrease in Common stock. 
 The shares associated with the remaining portion of the aggregate purchase price have been settled over two tranches. In July 2024, the first tranche was settled upon final delivery to us of approximately 0.4 million shares of common stock. In September 2024, with respect to the second tranche, we owed approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock that we elected to cash settle for 261 million. The cash payment required as a result of the second tranche settlement was due to the significant increase in the price of our common stock during the ASR term. The final average price under the ASR was 94.28 per share. 
 We may also reacquire shares outside of the program in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 262 thousand shares outside of the program related to our employee savings plan.
