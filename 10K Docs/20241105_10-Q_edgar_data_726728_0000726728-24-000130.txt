 (1) The initial weighted average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property. Since it is possible that a client could default on the payment of contractual rent (defined as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables), we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above. Contractual net operating income used in the calculation of initial weighted average cash lease yield includes approximately million received as settlement credits as reimbursement of free rent periods for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return. When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the initial weighted average cash lease yield is computed as follows: estimated cash net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. 
 (2) Includes million of Sterling-denominated investments, and million of Euro-denominated investments, converted at the applicable exchange rates on the funding dates.

 A. Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, escrow deposits, accounts payable, distributions payable, line of credit payable and commercial paper borrowings, and other liabilities approximate their carrying value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, due to their short-term nature. The aggregate fair value of our term loans approximates carrying value due to the frequent repricing of the variable interest rate charged on the borrowing. 
 Notes and bonds payable (1) 

The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable and private senior notes payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using an interest rate based upon the relevant forward interest rate curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread. Because this methodology includes unobservable inputs that reflect our own internal assumptions and calculations, the measurement of estimated fair values related to our mortgages payable and private senior notes payable are categorized as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 The estimated fair values of our publicly-traded senior notes and bonds payable are based upon indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable. Because this methodology includes inputs that are less observable by the public and are not necessarily reflected in active markets, the measurement of the estimated fair values related to our notes and bonds payable is categorized as level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions and purchase offers received from third parties, which are level 3 inputs. We may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of such real estate. Estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and estimates can differ materially from actual results.

 We enter into foreign currency exchange swap agreements to reduce the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the USD, our reporting currency, and GBP and EUR. These derivative contracts generally mature within and are not designated as hedge instruments for accounting purposes. As the currency exchange swap is not accounted for as a hedging instrument, the change in fair value is recorded in earnings through the caption entitled 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net' in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

 Investments During the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 0.7 billion at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.4 , including an investment in 169 properties and properties under development or expansion. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we invested 2.1 billion at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.7 , including an investment in 300 properties, properties under development or expansion, and an investment in a loan. See notes 4 , Investments in Real Estate, 5 , Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, and 6, Investments in Loans, to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Equity Capital Raising 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we raised 271.0 million of proceeds from the sale of common stock, at a weighted average price of 62.25 per share, primarily through proceeds from the sale of common stock through our ATM program. The ATM program issuances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 4.3 million shares issued pursuant to forward sale confirmations. As of September 30, 2024, 16.8 million shares of common stock subject to forward sale confirmations have been executed but not settled. See note 15 , Stockholders' Equity , to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Note Issuances 
 In September 2024, we issued 350.0 million of 5.000 senior unsecured notes due October 2029 and 350.0 million of 5.250 senior unsecured notes due September 2041. 
 In August 2024, we issued 500.0 million of 5.375 senior unsecured notes due September 2054. 
 See note 10, Notes Payable , to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Closing of Spirit Merger 
 On January 23, 2024, we closed on our previously announced stock-for-stock merger with Spirit (formerly NYSE: SRC). The Merger is further described in note 2, Merger with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. , to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Redemption of Preferred Stock 
 On September 30, 2024, we redeemed all 6.9 million shares outstanding of our 6.000 Series A Preferred Stock Realty Income Series A preferred stock ), which was converted from Spirit's outstanding preferred stock in connection with the Merger, at a redemption price of 25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. For more details, see note 16, Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Client Update 
 As part of the initial purchase price allocation for the acquisition of a sale-leaseback in the convenience store industry, we recorded financing receivables for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value. Following lease payment default by the tenant and our evaluation of recoverability, we recorded a provision for impairment of 63.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 69.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which accounted for a dilution impact of 0.07 and 0.08 per share, respectively, to our net income and funds from operations FFO ). At September 30, 2024, the tenant's financing receivable balance has been fully reserved. 
 Portfolio Discussion 
 Leasing Results 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 196 properties available for lease or sale out of 15,457 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.7 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio. Our property-level occupancy rates exclude properties with ancillary leases only, such as cell towers and billboards, and properties with possession pending, and include properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Below is a summary of our portfolio activity for the periods indicated below: 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 
 Properties available for lease at June 30, 2024 
 185 Lease expirations (1) 
 212 Re-leases to same client (131) Re-leases to new client (11) Vacant dispositions (59) Properties available for lease at September 30, 2024 
 196 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Properties available for lease at December 31, 2023 
 193 Lease expirations (1) 
 642 Re-leases to same client (441) Re-leases to new client (32) Vacant dispositions (166) Properties available for lease at September 30, 2024 
 196 
 (1) Includes scheduled and unscheduled expirations (including leases rejected in bankruptcy), as well as future expirations resolved in the periods indicated above. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was 38.41 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of 36.57 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 105.0 on the units re-leased. We re-leased two units to new clients without a period of vacancy, and 14 units to new clients after a period of vacancy. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was 131.50 million, as compared to the previous annual rent of 125.39 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 104.9 on the units re-leased. We re-leased 16 units to new clients without a period of vacancy, and 29 units to new clients after a period of vacancy. 
 As part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions to unrelated, third-party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard, and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients. We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations.

Disposition Strategy 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 214 properties with total net proceeds received of 451.4 million. Our disposition strategy aims at further enhancing our portfolio and maximizing portfolio returns through the sale of select assets. It remains a function of our proactive investment management approach, supported by several data-driven tools including our predictive analytics platform. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, or retail price index in the case of certain leases in the U.K. (typically subject to ceilings), or increases in the clients sales volumes. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs. 
 Moreover, our strategic focus on the use of net lease agreements reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses. Even though the utilization of net leases reduces our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients' ability to pay rent. Additionally, inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, make it difficult to refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the properties we can acquire if the cost of financing an acquisition is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such property, thereby limiting the properties that can be acquired. 
 Impact of Real Estate and Capital Markets 
 In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the global capital markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and global capital markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 5.2 billion of liquidity, which consists of cash and cash equivalents of 397.0 million, unsettled ATM forward equity of 958.1 million, and 3.8 billion of availability under our 4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, net of 427.5 million of borrowing on the revolving credit facility. We use our unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under our commercial paper programs. 
 Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the Material Cash Requirements table, which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through a combination of the following: 
 Cash and cash equivalents; 
 Future cash flows from operations; 
 Issuances of common stock or debt, or other securities offerings; 
 Additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility (after deducting outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs); 
 Short-term loans; 
 Asset dispositions; and 
 Credit investment repayments 
 In addition to these sources of liquidity, we are exploring various capital diversification initiatives, including the establishment of a third-party private capital open-end fund. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper programs. 
 Long-Term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our goal is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our stockholders that increase over time. Historically, we have met our principal short-term and long-term capital needs, including the funding of high-quality real estate acquisitions, investments in loans to clients, property development, and capital expenditures by issuing common

stock, long-term unsecured notes, and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of an offering to be accretively invested into additional properties or to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us. 
 Capitalization 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total capitalization was 82.8 billion. Total capitalization consisted of 55.7 billion of common equity (based on the September 30, 2024 closing price on the NYSE of 63.42 and assuming the conversion of 2.7 million common units of Realty Income, L.P.), and total outstanding borrowings of 27.1 billion on our revolving credit facility, term loans, mortgages payable, senior unsecured notes and bonds, and our proportionate share of unconsolidated entities' debt (excluding unamortized deferred financing costs, discounts, and premiums). Our total debt to capitalization was 32.7 at September 30, 2024. 
 Universal Shelf Registration 
 On February 16, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in February 2027. In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. 
 ATM Program 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately 16.8 million shares of unsettled common stock subject to forward sale confirmations through our ATM program, representing approximately 958.1 million in expected net proceeds, which have been executed at a weighted average price of 56.88 per share (assuming full physical settlement of all outstanding shares of common stock, subject to such forward sale agreements and certain assumptions made with respect to settlement dates). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we settled approximately 13.9 million shares of common stock previously sold pursuant to forward sale agreements through our ATM program for approximately 809.9 million of net proceeds. As of September 30, 2024, we had 56.7 million shares remaining for future issuance under our ATM program. We anticipate maintaining the availability of our ATM program in the future, including the replenishment of authorized shares issuable thereunder. 
 Debt Financing Activities 
 At September 30, 2024, our total outstanding borrowings of revolving credit facility, commercial paper, term loans, mortgages payable, and senior unsecured notes and bonds were 26.4 billion, with a weighted average maturity of 6.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9 . As of September 30, 2024, approximately 96 of our total debt was fixed rate debt. See notes 7 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our outstanding debt, along with our debt financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 below. 
 Note Issuances

Note Repayments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid the following notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest upon maturity (in millions): 
 Note Repayment Date of Issuance Maturity Date Principal amount 4.600 Notes 
 February 2014 February 2024 500.0 3.875 Notes

 Term Loan Issuances 
 In January 2024, in connection with our merger with Spirit, we entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement (which replaced Spirit's then-existing term loans with various lenders). The amended and restated term loan agreements are fixed through interest rate swaps at a weighted average interest rate of 3.9 . Pursuant to the amended and restated term loan agreement, we borrowed 800.0 million in aggregate total borrowings, 300.0 million of which matures in August 2025 and 500.0 million of which matures in August 2027 (the 800 million term loan agreement ). We also entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement pursuant to which we borrowed 500.0 million in aggregate total borrowings which matures in June 2025 (the 500 million term loan agreement ). 
 Term Loan Redemption 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid our 250.0 million senior unsecured term loan in full upon maturity. 
 Mortgage Repayments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 626.3 million in principal payments, including the full repayment of three mortgages for 622.7 million. 
 Covenants 
 The following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. These calculations, which are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance. The actual amounts as of September 30, 2024, are:

 (1) Our debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumptions that: (i) the incurrence of any debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on October 1, 2023 and subject to certain additional adjustments. Such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of October 1, 2023, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period. Fixed charge coverage is calculated in the same manner as the debt service coverage. The following is our calculation of debt service and fixed charge coverage at September 30, 2024 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months): 
 Net income attributable to the Company

Credit Agency Ratings 
 The borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. As of September 30, 2024, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Moody s Investors Service has assigned a rating of A3 with a stable outlook and Standard Poor s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A- with a stable outlook. In addition, we were assigned the following ratings on our commercial paper at September 30, 2024: Moody's Investors Service has assigned a rating of P-2 and Standard Poor's Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A-2. 
 Based on our credit agency ratings as of September 30, 2024, interest rates under our credit facility for U.S. borrowings would have been at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 0.725 with a SOFR adjustment charge of 0.10 and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in drawn pricing of 0.95 over SOFR, for GBP borrowings, at the Sterling Overnight Indexed Average SONIA ), plus 0.725 with a SONIA adjustment charge of 0.0326 and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in drawn pricing of 0.8826 over SONIA, and for EUR Borrowings at one-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR ), plus 0.725 , and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in drawn pricing of 0.85 over one-month EURIBOR. In addition, our credit facility provides that the interest rates can range between: (i) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 1.40 if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or our senior unsecured debt is unrated and (ii) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 0.70 if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher. In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 0.30 for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.10 for a credit rating of A/A2 or higher. 
 We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions. If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

DIVIDEND POLICY 
 Distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock. 
 
 Distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders (subject to the adjustment factor applicable to those units at the time of such distribution). 
 In order to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2023, our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 2.11 billion, or approximately 134.4 of our taxable income of 1.57 billion. Certain measures are available to us to reduce or eliminate our tax exposure as a REIT, and accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes, other than our taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a "TRS"), has been made. Our taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our cash on hand and funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. We distributed 2.3350 per share to stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing 74.4 of our diluted Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders ("AFFO") per share of 3.14. 
 Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders ("Normalized FFO"), AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility. 
 Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for qualified dividend income is generally 20 . In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT s stock and the REIT s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our TRSs) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). However, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20 of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. 
 Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 6.8 of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2023, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes.

For purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year, except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, or (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. Beginning with the second quarter of 2024, properties acquired through the merger with Spirit were considered under each element of our Same Store Pool criteria, except for the requirement that the property be owned for the full comparative period. If the property was owned by Spirit for the full comparative period and each of the other criteria were met, the property was included in our Same Store Pool. Accordingly, Spirit properties have been included in the Same Store Pool for the quarter and have been excluded for the year-to-date calculation. Each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above, explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period. 
 Of the 16,490 in-place leases in the portfolio, 13,544, or 82.1 , were under leases that provide for increases in rents through: base rent increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), percentage rent based on a percentage of the clients gross sales, fixed increases, or a combination of two or more of the aforementioned rent provisions. 
 Rent based on a percentage of our clients' gross sales, or percentage rent, was 3.1 million and 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 10.8 million and 8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Percentage rent represents less than 1.0 of rental revenue. 
 At September 30, 2024, our portfolio of 15,457 properties was 98.7 leased with 196 properties available for lease or sale, as compared to 98.6 leased with 193 properties available for lease at December 31, 2023, and 98.8 leased with 159 properties available for lease at September 30, 2023. It has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future, given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events. 
 Rental Revenue (reimbursable) 
 A number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. Contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients increased by 13.0 million and 19.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the growth of our portfolio due to acquisitions, partially offset by lower taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a modification of tax remittance terms with one of our clients in 2023.

 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 106.7 million and 369.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same periods in 2023, respectively, primarily due to the merger with Spirit, the acquisitions of properties in 2023 and 2024; partially offset by property dispositions. The Spirit merger contributed an additional 111.2 million and 303.9 million of depreciation and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Interest Expense 
 The following is a summary of the components of our interest expense (dollars in thousands):

 Interest expense increased by 77.2 million and 226.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same periods in 2023, respectively, primarily due to an increase in average borrowings and weighted average interest rates, primarily due to issuance of senior notes at higher fixed interest rates, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest driven by an increase in development. See notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness.

Property Expenses (excluding reimbursable) 
 Property expenses (excluding reimbursable) consist of costs associated with properties available for lease, non-net-leased properties and general portfolio expenses and include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections and legal fees. 
 Property expenses (excluding reimbursable) increased by 8.2 million and 27.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same periods in 2023, respectively, primarily due to a higher number of properties available for lease compared with the same periods in 2023, in addition to acquisitions in 2023 and 2024 in which the lease terms do not obligate the tenant to pay certain expenses, which resulted in higher repairs and maintenance costs, property insurance and taxes. 
 Property Expenses (reimbursable) 
 Property expenses (reimbursable) consist of reimbursable property taxes and operating costs paid on behalf of our clients. Property expenses (reimbursable) increased by 13.0 million and 19.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same periods in 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 6.4 million and 21.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same periods in 2023, respectively, primarily due to higher employee costs of 4.6 million and 14.5 million, respectively, and higher professional fees of 1.7 million and 3.7 million, respectively. 
 Provisions for Impairment 
 The following table summarizes our provisions for impairment during the periods indicated below (in millions):

 (1) See note 12 , Fair Value Measurements , to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 (2) See note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Merger, Transaction, and Other Costs 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 8.6 million and 105.5 million, respectively, of merger, transaction, and other costs consisting of 2.9 million and 99.8 million, respectively of transaction and integration-related costs related to Spirit, which largely consisted of employee severance, post-combination share-based compensation, transfer taxes, and various professional fees directly attributable to the Merger, as well as 5.1 million for each of the respective periods related to the lease termination of a legacy corporate facility. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred 2.9 million and 4.5 million of merger, transaction, and other costs, respectively, in conjunction with our merger with VEREIT in November 2021. 
 Gain on Sales of Real Estate 
 The following summarizes our property dispositions (dollars in millions): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Number of properties sold 92 24 214 79 Net sales proceeds 249.5 32.3 451.4 92.8 Gain on sales of real estate 50.6 7.6 92.3 19.7 
 Foreign Currency and Derivative Gain (Loss), Net 
 We borrow in the functional currencies of the countries in which we invest. Net foreign currency gain and loss are primarily related to the remeasurement of intercompany debt from foreign subsidiaries. Derivative gain and loss are primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and settlement of designated derivatives reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI"). 
 -42- 

Table of Contents 

Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net increased by 1.1 million and decreased by 2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same periods in 2023, respectively, primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency rates related to remeasurement of intercompany debt. 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Entities 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities was 5.1 million and 5.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There was no equity in earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities is due to an increase in our joint venture investments. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net decreased by 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a loss of 1.5 million on the sale of a loan, lower insurance proceeds, partially offset by higher interest income on short-term investments. 
 Other income, net increased by 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher interest income on short-term investments, partially offset by lower insurance proceeds compared to the prior year. 
 Income Taxes Income taxes primarily consist of international income taxes accrued or paid by us and our subsidiaries, as well as state and local taxes. The increase of 4.0 million and 10.3 million in income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same periods in 2023, respectively, is primarily attributable to higher taxable income in the U.K. 
 Preferred Stock Dividends 
 The increase in preferred stock dividends of 2.6 million and 7.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared with the same period in 2023, is due to the issuance of Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the Spirit merger. 
 Excess of Redemption Value over Carrying Value of Preferred Shares Redeemed 
 In September 2024, we redeemed all 6.9 million of Realty Income Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. The excess of the 25.00 liquidation price per share over the carrying value of Realty Income Series A preferred stock redeemed resulted in a loss on redemption of 5.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate ("Adjusted EBITDA re ") 
 Nareit established an EBITDA metric for real estate companies (i.e., EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDA re it believed would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among REITs. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA re is generally consistent with the Nareit definition, other than our adjustment to remove foreign currency and derivative gain and loss and merger, transaction, and other costs. We define Adjusted EBITDAre, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent quarter as earnings (net income) before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) provisions for impairment, (v) merger, transaction, and other costs, (vi) gain on sales of real estate, (vii) foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, net, and (viii) our proportionate share of adjustments from unconsolidated entities. Our Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDAre reported by other companies or as defined by Nareit, and other companies may interpret or define Adjusted EBITDA re differently than we do. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA re to be a meaningful measure of a REIT s performance because it provides a view of our operating performance, analyzes our ability to meet interest payment obligations before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, provisions for impairment, gain on sales of real estate and other items, as defined above, that affect comparability, including the removal of non-recurring and non-cash items that industry observers believe are less relevant to evaluating the operating performance of a company. In addition, EBITDA re is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders, investors, rating agencies, and others as a means of evaluating the operational cash generating capacity of a company prior to servicing debt obligations. Management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA re metric, which we refer to as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re , is meaningful because it represents our current earnings run rate for the period presented. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re and Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re , as defined below, are also used to determine the vesting of performance share awards granted to executive officers. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance. We define Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re , subject to certain adjustments to incorporate Adjusted EBITDA re from investments we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove Adjusted EBITDA re from investments we disposed of during the applicable quarter, and include transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period. Our calculation includes all adjustments consistent with the requirements to present Adjusted EBITDA re on a pro forma basis in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes. We believe Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re is a useful non-GAAP supplemental measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Management also uses our ratios of Net Debt/Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re and Net Debt/Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re as measures of leverage in assessing our financial performance, which is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share of debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents), divided by annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA re and annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re , respectively.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ("FFO") AND NORMALIZED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ("Normalized FFO") 
 We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus provisions for impairments of depreciable real estate assets, and reduced by gain on property sales. We define Normalized FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, as FFO excluding merger, transaction, and other costs. We define diluted FFO and diluted normalized FFO as FFO and normalized FFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests.

 (1) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 8.6 million and 105.5 million, respectively, of merger, transaction, and other costs consisting primarily of 2.9 million and 99.8 million, respectively, of transaction and integration-related costs related to Spirit and 5.1 million for each of the respective periods related to the lease termination of a legacy corporate facility. 
 We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a REIT s operating performance as they are based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for FFO, and adds back merger, transaction, and other costs, for Normalized FFO. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative.

ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ("AFFO") 
 We define AFFO, a non-GAAP measure, as FFO adjusted for unique revenue and expense items, which we believe are not as pertinent to the measurement of our ongoing operating performance. We define diluted AFFO as AFFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests. 
 The following summarizes our AFFO (dollars in millions, except per share data):

 (1) All per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis. 
 We consider AFFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement, but they may use the term CAD (for Cash Available for Distribution), FAD (for Funds Available for Distribution) or other terms. Our AFFO calculations may not be comparable to AFFO, CAD or FAD reported by other companies, and other companies may interpret or define such terms differently than we do.

 We believe the non-GAAP financial measure AFFO provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies. In particular, AFFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company s on-going operating performance. Therefore, we believe that AFFO is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate U.S. GAAP performance metric to which AFFO should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders.

Table of Contents 

Presentation of the information regarding FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments. 
 
 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION 
 At September 30, 2024, most of the properties in our portfolio were leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients' gross sales above a specified level. 
 We define total portfolio annualized contractual rent as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables, as of the balance sheet date, multiplied by 12, excluding percentage rent, interest income on loans and preferred equity investments, and including our pro rata share of such revenues from properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe total portfolio annualized contractual rent is a useful supplemental operating measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Total portfolio annualized contractual rent has not been reduced to reflect reserves recorded as adjustments to U.S. GAAP rental revenue in the periods presented. 
 Top 10 Industry Concentrations 
 We are engaged in a single business activity, which is the leasing of property to clients, generally on a net basis. That business activity spans various geographic boundaries and includes property types and clients engaged in various industries. Even though we have a single segment, we believe our investors continue to view diversification as a key component of our investment philosophy and so we believe it remains important to present certain information regarding our property portfolio classified according to the business of the respective clients, expressed as a percentage of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent:

IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 For information on the impact of new accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. There have been no material changes to the Critical Accounting Policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to economic risks from interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. A portion of these risks is hedged, but the risks may affect our financial statements. 
 Interest Rates 
 We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and commercial paper programs, term loans, mortgages payable, and long-term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we issue long-term notes and bonds, primarily at fixed rates. 
 In order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate locks and caps. The use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, including counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract. To limit counterparty credit risk, we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. 
 The following table presents, by year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024. This information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in millions):

 (1) The maturity date for our 2023 term loans assumes a twelve-month extension available at the company's option is exercised. In January 2024, we entered into interest rate swaps on our 2023 term loans, which fix our per annum interest rate at 4.9 until January 2026, which is the term loan maturity date if our remaining extension option is exercised. 
 (2) In conjunction with the pricing of our senior unsecured notes due January 2026, we executed three-year, fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps totaling 500.0 million, which are subject to the counterparties' right to terminate the swaps at any time following the 2026 notes par call date. 
 (3) Excludes net premiums and discounts recorded on mortgages payable, net premiums and discounts recorded on notes payable, deferred financing costs on term loans, mortgages payable, notes payable, and the basis adjustment on interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges on notes payable. 
 (4) We base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate mortgages and private senior notes payable at September 30, 2024, on the relevant forward interest rate curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread. We base the estimated fair value of the publicly traded fixed rate senior notes and bonds at September 30, 2024, on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable. We believe that the carrying values of the line of credit, commercial paper borrowings, and term loans reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at September 30, 2024. 
 The table above incorporates only those exposures that exist as of September 30, 2024. It does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates. 
 At September 30, 2024, our outstanding mortgages payable, notes, and bonds had fixed interest rates. Interest on our credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and term loans is variable. However, the variable interest rate feature on our term loans have been mitigated by interest rate swap agreements. At September 30, 2024, a 1 change in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would change our interest rate costs by 9.3 million. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. We continuously evaluate and manage our foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, including currency exchange swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties where practicable. Such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. Additionally, our inability to redeploy rent receipts from our international operations on a timely basis subjects us to foreign exchange risk. 
 
 Item 4: Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 -51- 

Table of Contents 

As of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1A: Risk Factors 
 
 You should carefully consider the risks described in "Item 1A, Risk Factors" in Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described therein.
