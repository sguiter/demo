and of platinum is in the form of good delivery platinum bars as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
A current list of all platinum held by the Custodian is available on the sponsor s website. The cost of platinum is determined
according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the London Bullion Market Association LBMA Platinum
Price PM. 

LBMA
Platinum Price PM is the price per troy ounce of platinum, stated in U.S. dollars, determined by the LME, following an auction process
starting after 2:00 p.m. (London time), on each day that the London platinum market is open for business, and announced by the LME shortly
thereafter. 

The
per Share amount of platinum exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee, using the LBMA Platinum Price
PM to calculate the platinum amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering platinum sales have not yet been made, and represents
the per Share amount of platinum held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any
losses that may have occurred. 

ASC
820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are
as follows: 

Level
1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 

Level
2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar
data. 

Level
3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust s
own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based
on the best information available.

of the adjusted daily net asset value of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears. 

The
Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly fee and
out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing fees, United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and certain
legal expenses. 

As
of period ended September 30, 2024, the fees payable to the Sponsor were . As of the year June 30, 2024, the fees payable to the
Sponsor were . 

With
respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion,
sell the Trust s platinum as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling platinum to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor
to sell the smallest amounts of platinum needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other
than platinum. Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Unless
otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling platinum the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the LBMA PM Platinum
Price. The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the
most favorable price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such platinum only if the sale transaction is made
at the next LBMA PM Platinum Price or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set following
the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the cost of the platinum sold. Neither
the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized
gains and losses result from the transfer of platinum for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date
basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of platinum transferred. Gain or loss on sales of platinum bullion is calculated
on a trade date basis using the average cost method. 

Shares (a block of Shares is called a Basket only to Authorized
Participants on an ongoing basis. The creation and redemption of Baskets will only be made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust
or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of platinum represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which
will be based on the combined ounces represented by the number of shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined
on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 

Orders
to create and redeem Baskets may be placed only by Authorized Participants. An Authorized Participant must: (1) be a registered broker-dealer
or other securities market participant, such as a bank or other financial institution, which, but for an exclusion from registration,
would be required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions, (2) be a participant in DTC, and (3) must have
an agreement with the Custodian establishing an unallocated account in London or have an existing unallocated account meeting the standards
described herein. To become an Authorized Participant, a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor
and the Trustee. The Authorized Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the
delivery of the platinum required for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures
attached thereto may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor, without the consent of any investor or Authorized Participant. A transaction
fee of will be assessed on all creation and redemption transactions. Multiple Baskets may be created on the same day, provided each
Basket meets the requirements described below and that the Custodian is able to allocate platinum to the Trust Allocated Account such
that the Trust Unallocated Account holds no more than ounces of platinum at the close of a business day. 

Authorized
Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets will receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation
or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor
or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of shares. 

reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 

The
Sponsor evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Trust s tax returns to determine whether
the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to
meet that threshold would be recorded as an expense in the current year. The Trust is required to analyze all open tax years. Open tax
years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority. As of September 30, 2024, .

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This
information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included in Item 1 of Part
I of this Form 10-Q. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance.
In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may, should, could, 
 expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, 
 potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws,
neither the Sponsor, nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any forward-looking statements.
Neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual
results or to a change in the Sponsor s expectations or predictions. 

Introduction 

The
Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the state of New York on January 11, 2018. The Trust is not managed like a corporation
or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to
the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required
to register under such act. It does not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool, or subject to regulation
as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing Shares. 

The
Trust holds platinum and is expected to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of platinum, and to distribute platinum in connection
with redemptions of Baskets. Shares issued by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust.
The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of platinum, less the Trust s expenses.
The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective investment relative to traditional means of
investing in platinum. 

The
Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants in exchange for platinum and only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares
or integral multiples thereof. A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. 

Shares
of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE Arca under the symbol PLTM . 

Valuation
of Platinum; Computation of Net Asset Value 

On
each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee values the platinum held by the Trust and determines
the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV. The Trustee values the platinum held by the Trust using that day s LBMA Platinum
Price PM. If there is no announced LBMA Platinum PM on a business day, the Trustee is authorized to use that day s LBMA Platinum
Price AM. Having valued the platinum held by the Trust, the Trustee then subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of
the Trust from the value of the platinum and other assets of the Trust. The result is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee computes
the NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made. 

11 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes
to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the
Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s Fee. 

The
Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s platinum as necessary to pay the Trust s
expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell platinum to pay the Sponsor s Fee but will pay the Sponsor s
Fee through in-kind transfers of platinum to the Sponsor. At March 31, 2022 the Trust did not have any cash balances. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial
position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. Below,
the Trust describes the valuation of platinum bullion, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding
its results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report
for further discussion of the Trust s accounting policies. 

Results
of Operations 

The
Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 

The
Trust s net asset value decreased from 43,119,274 on June 30, 2024 to 41,914,842 on September 30, 2024, a 2.79 decrease. The
Trust s net asset value decreased due to the negative change in the price of platinum, which moved from 1,012.00 on June 30, 2024
to 985.00 on September 30, 2024, or -2.67 . There were no changes in the number of shares outstanding, which remained at 4,400,000. 

The
2.76 decrease in the Trust s net asset value per share, from 9.80 on June 30, 2024 to 9.53 on September 30, 2024 is directly
related to the 2.67 decrease in the price of platinum. 

The
Trust s net asset value per share decreased slightly more than the price of platinum on a percentage basis due to the
Sponsor s fees, which were 51,796 for the quarter, or 0.5 of the Trust s average weighted net assets of 41,072,902
during the quarter. The net asset value per share of 9.91 on July 05, 2024 was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low
during the quarter of 8.80 on September 04, 2024. 

The
net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 1,204,433, resulting from an unrealized
loss on investment in platinum bullion of 1,149,099, a loss of 3,538 on metal sold to cover redemption orders and Sponsor s fees,
and the Sponsor s fees of 51,796. Other than the Sponsor s fees the Trust had no expenses during the quarter. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
duly authorized officers of the Sponsor, performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Trust s disclosure controls
and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required
to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the duly authorized officers of the Sponsor performing functions equivalent to those a principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the Trust would perform if the Trust had any officers to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in the internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s internal control over financial reporting.
