owned) PCG Utah ), and Park City Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation owned) PCG Delaware and together with PCG Utah, the Subsidiaries ). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the Company s consolidated financial statements, which contain the Company s results from operations. The Company has no business operations separate from the operations conducted through its Subsidiaries. 
 
 The Company s principal executive offices are located at 5282 South Commerce Drive, Suite D292, Murray, Utah 84107. Its telephone number is 435 645 - 2000. Its website address is www.repositrak.com. 

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation 
 
 The interim financial information of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is unaudited, and the balance sheet as of June 30, 2024 is derived from audited financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (" U.S. GAAP ") for interim financial statements. Accordingly, they omit or condense notes and certain other information normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The accounting policies followed for quarterly financial reporting conform with the accounting policies disclosed in the Notes to Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended June 30, 2024 . In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the interim periods reported have been made. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024 . The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10 -K for the year ended June 30, 2024 . 

If the Company s invoicing is not consistent with the value delivered, revenue is recognized as the service is performed based on the method described above. The output method measures the results achieved and value transferred to a customer, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information; such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. Revenue related to fixed-price hosting and infrastructure services is recognized based on the Company s right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered, in accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606 - 10 - 55 - 18. If the Company s invoicing is not consistent with value delivered, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis unless revenue is earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. The revenue recognition method applied to the types of contracts described above provides the most faithful depiction of performance towards satisfaction of the Company s performance obligations. 
 
 Revenue related to the Company s software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software is recognized when the software is delivered as control is transferred at a point in time. For software license arrangements that require significant functionality enhancements or modification of the software, revenue for the software license and related services is recognized as the services are performed in accordance with the methods described above. In software hosting arrangements, the rights provided to the customer, such as ownership of a license, contract termination provisions and the feasibility of the client to operate the software, are considered in determining whether the arrangement includes a license or a service. Revenue related to software maintenance and support is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. 
 
 Management expects that incremental commission fees paid as a result of obtaining a contract are recoverable and therefore the Company capitalized them as contract costs. The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. 
 
 Revenue related to transaction-based or volume-based contracts is recognized over the period the services are provided in a manner that corresponds with the value transferred to the customer to-date relative to the remaining services to be provided. 
 
 From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases, the Company evaluates whether the Company is the principal (i.e., report revenue on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenue on a net basis). In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, the Company is the principal; if not, the Company is the agent. Determining whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer may require judgment. 
 
 The Company provides customers with assurance that the related deliverable will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. General updates or patch fixes are not considered an additional performance obligation in the contract. 
 
 Variable consideration is estimated using either the sum of probability weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts (expected value), or the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (most likely amount), depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which we may be entitled. The Company includes in the transaction price variable consideration only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price may involve judgment and is based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available to the Company. 

The Company assesses the timing of the transfer of goods or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. As a practical expedient, the Company does not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of the Company s invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing its services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. The Company does not consider set up or transition fees paid upfront by its customers to represent a financing component, as such fees are required to encourage customer commitment to the project and protect us from early termination of the contract.

Our contract assets and liabilities are reported at the end of each reporting period. The difference between the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between our performance obligations and the customer s payment. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts, which may vary generally by contract type. 
 
 The table below shows movements in the deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent) for the period:

Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The difference between the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between our performance obligations and the customer s payment. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts, which may vary generally by contract type. 

Non-recurring revenue setup and training services 

par value Common Stock ( Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share of Common Stock Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other contracts to issue shares of Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock. The computation of Diluted EPS does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on net income per share of Common Stock. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , warrants to purchase 0 and shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of per share were anti-dilutive and not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average price of Common Stock for the quarter.

 As of September 30, 2024 , there was approximately million of unrecognized stock-based compensation obligations under our equity compensation plans. The stock-based compensation obligation is in connection with certain employment agreements which have a deferral option at the Board s discretion. At the end of the deferral period, the stock-based compensation expense associated with the obligation is expected to be recognized on a straight-line basis over a period of three years. 
 
 Warrants 
 
 Outstanding warrants were issued in connection with private placements of the Company s Common Stock and with the restructuring of the Series B Preferred that occurred in March of 2018. The following table summarizes information about fixed stock warrants outstanding at September 30, 2024 : 

During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors approved the modification to extend the expiration dates of the Company s existing January 26, 2023 and February 5, 2023 warrants by an additional three years. Accordingly, all the Company s outstanding warrants have been extended and are anticipated to expire or be exercised on or before the quarter ending March 31, 2026.

 Recent Developments

 On September 19, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.0165 per share 0.066 per year), payable to shareholders of record on November 13, 2024, which were paid to shareholders of record on or about September 30, 2024.

 On September 30, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved a 10 increase to the quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payable to shareholders of record on December 31, 2024. 
 
 Federal Regulation Traceability: FSMA 204(d) and USDA SOE 
 
 In 2020, the United States Food Drug Administration FDA announced the New Era of Smarter Food Safety blueprint. It outlines achievable goals to enhance traceability, improve predictive analytics, respond more rapidly to outbreaks, address new business models, reduce contamination of food, and foster the development of stronger food safety cultures. 
 
 In November 2022, the FDA announced the final rule on the Food Safety Modernization Act Section 204(d) FSMA 204 - Traceability for High-Risk Foods. On January 20, 2023, the rule became effective and applies to any person or Company that manufactures, processes, packs or hold foods the FDA considers to be high risk for food borne illness, the so-called Food Traceability List FTL ). The FTL is comprised of 16 product categories of food, which represent thousands of products commonly sold in grocery and convenience stores, and all restaurants. As a result, every grocery distributor, wholesaler and retailer, and the food service supply chain, must now institute a traceability program that enables the capture, creation and sharing of specific Key Data Elements KDEs prescribed by the FDA and required for traceability, at each designated Critical Tracking Event CTE in the supply chain, for thousands of items. 
 
 FSMA 204 requires the traceability data records to be stored for two years, and be retrievable such that specific data records can be presented within 24 hours of a request from the FDA. FSMA 204 is ultimately about supply chain data recording record keeping, resulting is an enormous amount of data to manage, across more than one million supply chain and retail facilities. The deadline for compliance with FSMA 204 is January 20, 2026, and nearly every company impacted will require some type of technical systems support to meet the requirement. 
 
 While the FTL includes thousands of product types, the FDA has made it clear in its communications that the list is only the beginning. The FDA states that it would encourage the voluntary adoption of these practices industry-wide, There are some strong early indications that the industry will move to complete traceability of all food products within the next few years. 
 
 Traceability is, by definition, a supply chain data management issue, which is ReposiTrak s core expertise. That is why we have made it our goal to develop a traceability solution that is easy, inexpensive and meets FDA s requirements. The ReposiTrak Traceability Network RTN is a growing traceability solution, connecting thousands of supplier locations to thousands of food wholesaler and retail locations, using low cost, easy to deploy technology, on the ReposiTrak platform. As the largest connected network of food suppliers, wholesalers and retailers in the world, the ReposiTrak Traceability Network is positioned to provide end-to-end traceability to provide a safer food supply chain, tighten controls on food waste, and implement a food recall response that saves lives and money.

Revenue was 5,441,142 and 5,060,112 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a 8 increase year-over-year. The increase in revenue was due to growth in recurring subscription revenue primarily in traceability but includes growth in all lines of business. These include compliance, supply chain and traceability. Growth in traceability is the result of growing industry and consumer response to food contaminations and food safety hazards, whether biological, chemical, physical, or allergenic. The risks have elevated regulatory requirements, documentation requisites, and principally has resulted in mandates from the retailers to its suppliers. As more and more retailers, wholesalers and distributors mandate their requirements to suppliers, the Company continues to see a corresponding rise in demand for its services. 
 
 Although no assurances can be given, we continue to focus our sales efforts on marketing our software services on a recurring subscription basis and placing less emphasis on transactional revenue. However, we believe there will continue to be a small percentage of customers that will, from time to time, require buying a particular service outright (i.e., a license). Nonetheless, we will continue to deemphasize non-recurring transactional revenue when we are able.

This 92,885 increase is primarily the result of development to accelerate automation of onboarding and support services in effort to support the acceleration and expansion of the FSMA 204 initiative. Given the demand in traceability the Company has also expended additional resources on further upgrading its information security services to increase protection of customer data.

The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily the result of higher sales commissions, sales travel, and investment in marketing for our suite of services. The largest contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expense has been an increase in commission and FSMA 204 traceability awareness marketing. We believe the uptick in marketing costs will flatten over the next twelve months as awareness of the 2026 traceability regulatory deadline approaches.

Net other income was 335,094 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net other income of 279,003 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income increased due to higher cash balances and an increase in interest income attributable to higher earnings on fixed income instruments. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates, which reductions make it unlikely the Company will be able to maintain the same interest income on its existing cash balances without taking additional credit risk.

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We believe that our existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations, are sufficient to fund operating and investment requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, our rate of revenue growth, sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending required for research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services.

Liquidity and Working Capital 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had positive working capital of 25,634,543, as compared with positive working capital of 24,757,025 at June 30, 2024. This 877,518 increase in working capital is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and decrease in prepaid and other assets offset by a decrease in contract liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in annual subscriptions. Cash and cash equivalents also increased due to cash receipts from customers who have signed up for, among other offerings, the ReposiTrak Traceability Network.

Current liabilities totaled 4,457,376 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 4,543,142 as of June 30, 2024. The decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to the increase in deferred revenue offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities and paydown of certain financing lease liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had zero bank debt. 
 
 On October 6, 2021, the Company and the Bank executed a Revolving Credit Agreement (the " Revolving Credit Agreement and accompanying addendum (the " Addendum "), and Stand-Alone Revolving Note (the " Note " and collectively with the Revolving Credit Agreement and Addendum, the " Credit Agreement "), with an effective date of September 30, 2021. The Credit Agreement replaced the Company s prior 6.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement and Stand-Alone Revolving Note between the Company and the Bank, as amended and revised on January 9, 2019, and provided the Company with a 10.0 million revolving line of credit that matured on March 31, 2023. The Credit Agreement contained customary affirmative and negative covenants and conditions to borrowing, as well as customary events of default. Among other things, the Company must maintain liquid assets equal to 12 million and maintain a Senior Funded Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 3:1. 
 
 On April 28, 2023, the Company and the Bank executed an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment ), with an effective date of March 31, 2023. The Amendment sets forth that (1) the Company will increase its liquidity requirement from 10 million to 12 million, which the Company currently maintains over 22 million in cash and a current ratio of over 6:1, and (2) draws on the facility accrue interest at the annual rate, equal to 1.75 plus the one-month SOFR rate, instead of the previous LIBOR rate. As of March 31, 2024, the balance of the facility was zero. The Company had zero bank debt at September 30, 2024. 
 
 On March 15, 2024, given its strong financial position, the Company chose not to renew the Revolving Credit Agreement. There were no amounts due at the time of renewal. 
 
 While no assurances can be given, management currently believes that the Company will continue to increase its cash flow from operations and working capital position in subsequent periods. The Company s increase in anticipated cash flow from operations and working capital position is expected to be offset by the use of cash required to fund the Company s quarterly cash dividends of 0.015 per share, announced on September 28, 2022, December 30, 2022, February 10, 2023, March 21, 2023, June 20, 2023, September 19, 2023, and of 0.0165 per share, announced on December 12, 2023, March 18, 2024, June 18, 2024 and September 19, 2024, as well as the redemption and retirement of the Company s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock for their stated value, or 10.70 for each share of Preferred Stock, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of 8,964,214.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses the Company s financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We commenced operations in the software development and professional services business during 1990. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience of operations and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, will affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 In determining the carrying value of the Company s net deferred income tax assets, the Company must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions, to realize the benefit of these assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may record a reduction in the valuation allowance, resulting in an income tax benefit in the Company s statements of operations. Management evaluates quarterly whether to realize the deferred income tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance. 
 
 Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Asset Valuations 
 
 Goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Management reviews the long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Management evaluates, at each balance sheet date, whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment. 

- 19 -

Table of Contents 

The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long-lived asset. Economic useful lives of long-lived assets are assessed and adjusted as circumstances dictate. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Effective July 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , and its related amendments ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized and enhances certain disclosure around the nature, timing, amount and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customers. 
 
 ASU 2014-09 represents a change in the accounting model utilized for the recognition of revenue and certain expense arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using a modified retrospective approach and, accordingly, revenue and expense totals for all periods before July 1, 2018 reflect those previously reported under the prior accounting model and have not been restated. 
 
 See Note 2 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for a full description of the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards on our financial statements. Following the adoption of this guidance, the revenue recognition for our sales arrangements remained materially consistent with our historical practice and there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to our critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 
 The Company accounts for its share-based compensation to employees and non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or vesting period. 
 
 Leases 
 
 Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, " Leases (Topic 842)" (" ASU 2016-02 "). All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Report have been updated to comply with this new standard with results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2019 presented under ASU 2016-02, while prior period amounts and disclosures are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior period. 
 
 Available-for-Sale Debt Investments 
 
 We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments. Our available-for-sale debt investments primarily consist of U.S. government, U.S. government agency, non-U.S. government and agency, corporate debt, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI ). We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. 
 
 Impairment Consideration of Investments 
 
 For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a temporary or permanent credit loss exists. In this assessment, which requires judgment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If factors indicate a permanent credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The amount of fair value change relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income OCI ).

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our business is conducted principally in the United States. As a result, our financial results are not affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets. We do not engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates, although if the geographical scope of our business broadens, we may do so in the future. 
 
 Our exposure to risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in short-term financial instruments. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry some interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may fall due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Partly as a result of this, our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have fallen in estimated fair value due to changes in interest rates. However, as substantially all of our cash consist of bank deposits and short-term money market instruments, we do not expect any material change with respect to our net income as a result of an interest rate change. 
 
 Our exposure to interest rate changes related to borrowing has been limited, and we believe the effect, if any, of near-term changes in interest rates on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows should not be material. At September 30, 2024, our debt portfolio was composed of only capital leases. The effective APR fixed is 4.55 . We depreciate our total lease obligations on a three-year straight-line basis. The total cost is less than 400,000.
