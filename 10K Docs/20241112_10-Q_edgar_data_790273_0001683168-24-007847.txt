Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations 

Conectisys Corporation, a Colorado corporation Conectisys ,
the Company, we , us or our is a shell company seeking to create value for its shareholders
by merging with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our Common Stock. 

No potential merger candidate has been identified at this time. 

Our recurring expenses consist of minor administrative charges. 

We have no assets. 

We have minor unsecured liabilities. 

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains forward-looking statements. Except as required
by law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement after the date of this report, either to conform any statement to
reflect actual results or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated 

 events. 

General Business Plan 

Our business plan to seek a merger has many uncertainties which pose
risks to investors. 

We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants,
acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms which desire to seek the advantages of an issuer who
has complied with the Securities Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act ). We will not restrict our search to any specific business, industry
or geographical location, and we may participate in business ventures of virtually any nature. This discussion of our proposed business
is purposefully general and is not meant to be restrictive of our unlimited discretion to search for and enter into potential business
opportunities. We anticipate that we may be able to participate in only one potential business venture because of our lack of financial
resources. We may seek a business opportunity with entities which have recently commenced operations, or that desire to utilize the public
marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service,
or for other corporate purposes. All of these activities have risk to investors including dilution and management. 

Intellectual Property 

We own no intellectual property. 

Employees 

We presently have no full time executive, operational, or clerical
staff. Mr. Cacciamatta has been the sole director and sole officer of the Company since August 1, 2020. 

Factors Affecting Future Performance 

Rather than an operating business, our goal is to obtain debt and/or
equity financing to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities
for growth in return for shares of our Common Stock to create value for our shareholders. 

Although there is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully
completed, we believe we can successfully complete an acquisition or merger which will enable us to continue as a going concern. Any acquisition
or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing stockholders. 

9 

Plan of Operations 

We are currently investigating to identify and acquire a target company
or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months
and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term
earnings. The Company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location
and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 

To the extent that the Company's capital resources are insufficient
to meet current or planned operating requirements, the Company will seek additional funds through equity or debt financing, collaborative
or other arrangements with corporate partners, licensees or others, and from other sources, which may have the effect of diluting the
holdings of existing shareholders. The Company has no current arrangements with respect to, or sources of, such additional financing and
the Company does not anticipate that existing shareholders will provide any portion of the Company's future financing requirements. 

No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available
when needed or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate funds are not available, the Company
may be required to delay or terminate expenditures for certain of its programs that it would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize.
This would have a material adverse effect on the Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

This Item does not apply to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive, financial,
and accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
evaluation, we concluded that because of the material weakness and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting,
our disclosure controls and procedures are not sufficient. All such weaknesses and deficiencies are principally due to our lack of employees
and financial resources. 

10 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Neither we nor any of our officers, directors, or holders of five percent
or more of our Common Stock is a party to any pending legal proceedings and to the best of our knowledge, no such proceedings by or against
us or our officers, or directors or holders of five percent or more of our Common Stock have been threatened or is pending against us.

Stock in dividends from sources legally available therefor, when, and if, declared by our board of directors and, upon our liquidation

the holders of the Common Stock. Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share for all purposes, except that in the election
of directors, each holder shall have the right to vote such number of shares for as many persons as there are directors to be elected.
Cumulative voting shall not be allowed in the election of directors or for any other purpose, and the holders of Common Stock have no
preemptive rights, redemption rights or rights of conversion with respect to the Common Stock. Our board of directors is authorized to

issued and outstanding.

have been designated as Class A, 1,000,000 shares as Class B, and the remaining 48,000,000 shares are undesignated. 

Each share of Class A preferred is entitled to 100 votes on all matters
presented to the Company s shareholders for action. The Class A does not have any liquidation preference, additional voting rights,
anti-dilution rights, or any other preferential rights.
