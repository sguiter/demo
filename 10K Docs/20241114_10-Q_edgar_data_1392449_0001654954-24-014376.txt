MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General Overview The Company operates as a public reorganized corporation with the business purpose to acquire or merge with an existing business operation. Results of Operations and Financial Condition for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company had no active business operations for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Expenses consist of accounting and filing fees. Liquidity and capital resources The Company had no active business operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, all of the Company s cash flow needs were provided by a related party of Global Funds, the majority stockholder to pay expenses necessary as a public company. Going forward, the Company will continue to source adequate funding from future investors to execute business opportunities when they arise in the future. However, such funding and business opportunities will rely entirely on the prevailing circumstances when the funding or profitable business opportunities are identified. If such opportunities are not identified in the near term, the Company will experience delay in effecting its business plans. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as going concern. The Company is currently a public reorganized shell corporation and has no current business activity. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on continued support from a related party of Global Funds, a majority stockholder. This gives rise to substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Risk factors The Company s critical accounting policies are still being applied despite the fact that Company has no ongoing business operations. Significant Estimates We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon historical experience, current trends and other factors. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could be different than those estimates. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Market Risks There has been no material change in market risks since our last Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 10 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the fiscal period end, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 11 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
