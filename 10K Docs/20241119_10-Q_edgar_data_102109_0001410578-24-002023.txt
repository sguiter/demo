 ITEM 2 . MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As used throughout this Report, we, our, the Company USI and similar words refers to Universal Security Instruments, Inc. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations with respect to our operations, performance, financial condition, and other developments. These forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of the words may , will , believes , should , expects , anticipates , estimates , and similar expressions. These statements are necessarily estimates reflecting management s best judgment based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and readers are advised that various factors could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. While it is impossible to identify all such factors, such factors include, but are not limited to, those risks identified in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. OVERVIEW We are in the business of marketing and distributing safety and security products. Our financial statements detail our sales and other operational results for the three and six-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The Company has developed products based on new smoke and gas detection technologies, with what the Company believes are improved sensing technology and product features. Most of our new technologies and features have been trademarked under the trade name IoPhic. Changes in international trade duties and other aspects of international trade policy, both in the U.S. and abroad, could materially impact the cost of our products. All of our products are imported from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). To date, only certain of our products such as Carbon Monoxide and Photoelectric alarms, and certain wiring devices, have been subjected to tariffs of 25 . We are monitoring these developments and will determine our strategies as additional information becomes available. Any increase in tariffs that is not offset by an increase in our sales prices could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Sales. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 7,203,269 compared to 3,717,455 for the comparable three months in the prior year, an increase of 3,485,814 (93.8 ). Sales increased principally due to the timing of orders from a large retail customer. Gross Profit Margin. Gross profit margin is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net sales. Our gross profit margin was 27.7 and 35.2 of sales for the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Gross margins for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased principally due to an increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory recorded during the period ended September 30, 2024. In addition, gross margins in the current quarter decreased due to continued increases in the cost of certain electronic components and variations in the mix of products sold. Gross margins were negatively impacted in the period ended September 30, 2023, principally due to increases in the cost of certain electronic components. Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 1,209,352 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,334,351 for the comparable three months in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, these expenses decreased to 16.8 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, from 35.9 for the 2023 period. These expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales principally since selling, general, and administrative expenses do not increase or decrease in direct proportion to changes in sales. These expenses decreased as a dollar amount principally due to the timing of expenditures related to efforts in the current quarter and the comparable quarter of the prior year to pursue strategic alternatives and merger activities.

 Engineering and product development expenses were 110,371 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 131,415 for the comparable quarter of the prior year, a 21,044 (16.0 decrease. These expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in product development costs. Interest Expense. Our interest expense was 89,642 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expense of 33,509 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense is dependent upon the total amounts borrowed from the Factor and changes in interest rates during the period as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Net Income (Loss). We reported net income of 576,978 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 186,425 for the corresponding quarter of the prior fiscal year, a 763,403 (409.5 increase in net income. Net income increased principally due to the timing of orders to a large retailer as discussed above. Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Sales. Net sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024, were 11,801,785 compared to 10,416,226 for the comparable six months in the prior period, an increase of 1,385,559 (13.3 ). Sales increased principally due to the timing of orders to a large retailer, and due to improvements in deliveries of products, due to the easing of supply chain disruptions in shipping and handling of containers at California ports of entry. While delays in manufacturing and shipping have improved somewhat over the past fiscal year, we continue to experience delays in receiving inventory for sale. Gross Profit Margin. The gross profit margin is calculated as net sales less cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net sales. The Company s gross profit margin was 26.1 for the period ended September 30, 2024, and 29.0 for the period ended September 30, 2023. Gross margins for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased principally due to an increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory recorded during the period ended September 30, 2024. Gross margins are also impacted by variations in the mix of products sold and due to continued increases in the cost of certain electronic components. Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 2,606,773 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,757,290 for the comparable six months in the prior year. As a percentage of sales, these expenses were 22.1 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 26.5 for the comparable 2023 period. These expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales principally since selling, general, and administrative expenses do not increase or decrease in direct proportion to changes in sales. These expenses decreased as a dollar amount principally due to the timing of expenditures related to efforts in the current six-month period and the comparable period of the prior year to pursue strategic alternatives and merger activities. Engineering and product development expenses were comparable at 197,972 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, to 196,378 for the comparable period of the prior year. Interest Expense. Our interest expense was 134,530 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest expense of 84,005 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense is dependent upon the total amounts borrowed from the Factor and changes in interest rates during the period as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year. Net Income (Loss). We reported net income of 134,772 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 21,295 for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, an increase in net income of 156,067 (732.9 ). Operating activities used cash of 3,278,163 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and amount due from factor of 3,150,214, and an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses of 1,154,669, and partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 888,890 and net income of 134,772. Operating activities provided cash of 650,519 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and amount due from factor of 534,490, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and of 1,239,275, and partially offset by an increase in inventories, prepaid expenses of 1,105,053 and a net loss of 21,295. There were no investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024, or 2023. Financing activities provided cash of 3,447,281 during the six months ended September 30, 2024, which is comprised of borrowings net of repayments to the factor.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, funds available to borrow under the terms of its factoring agreement, and cash generated by ongoing operations will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements over the next twelve months and beyond. The Company s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since it filed its Form 10-K for the period ended March 31, 2024. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Form 10-K, we have disclosed those accounting policies that we consider to be significant in determining our results of Operations and financial condition. There have been no material changes to those policies that we consider to be significant since the filing of our Form 10-K. The accounting principles used in preparing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as such item is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d 15(e) of the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely manner. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated this system of disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission guidance as of the end of the period covered by this annual report and have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. A material weakness arose during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, in the management review controls over classification of and disclosure of amounts within the financial statements. The Company plans to remediate the material weakness by clarification of the classification of amounts and inclusion of the required disclosures.
