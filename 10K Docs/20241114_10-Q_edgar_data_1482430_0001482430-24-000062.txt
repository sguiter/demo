 , with short-term extension options available upon the Company meeting certain debt covenants. Each reporting period, management evaluates the Company s ability to continue as a going concern by evaluating conditions and events, including assessing the Company s liquidity needs in order to satisfy upcoming debt obligations and the Company s ability to satisfy debt covenant requirements. Through the normal course of operations, the Company has billion of notes payable maturing during the period from the issuance of these financial statements. In order to refinance, restructure or extend the Company s maturing debt obligations, the Company has been required to reduce the loan commitments and/or make paydowns on certain loans, and the Company may be required to make additional reductions to loan commitments and paydowns on the loans maturing during the next months in order to refinance, restructure or extend those loans. As a result of reductions in loan commitments and paydowns and the ongoing liquidity needs in the Company s real estate portfolio, the Company may consider selling assets into a challenged real estate market in an effort to manage its liquidity needs. Selling real estate assets in the current market would likely adversely impact the ultimate sale price. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate raising capital through the issuance of new equity or debt. The Company may also defer noncontractual expenditures. However, there can be no assurances as to the certainty or timing of management s plans to be effectively implemented within one year from the date the financial statements are issued, as certain elements of management s plans are outside the control of the Company, including its ability to successfully refinance, restructure or extend certain of its debt instruments, sell assets or raise capital. As a result of the Company s upcoming loan maturities, reductions in loan commitments and loan paydowns, the challenging commercial real estate lending environment, the current interest rate environment, leasing challenges in certain markets where the Company owns properties, reduction in the Company s cash flows due to elevated interest rates and the lack of transaction volume in the U.S. office market as well as general market instability, management s plans cannot be considered probable and thus do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 8, Notes Payable for further information regarding the Company s notes payable.

 years with a weighted-average remaining term of years. Some of the leases have provisions to extend the term of the leases, options for early termination for all or a part of the leased premises after paying a specified penalty, and other terms and conditions as negotiated. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires a security deposit from the tenant in the form of a cash deposit and/or a letter of credit. The amount required as a security deposit varies depending upon the terms of the respective lease and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally is not a significant amount. Therefore, exposure to credit risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of its security deposit. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized deferred rent from tenants of million and million, respectively.

 , and of the Company s total assets, respectively. As a result, the geographic concentration of the Company s portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the Illinois, California and Texas real estate markets. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect the Company s operating results. 
 Impairment of Real Estate 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of million to write down the carrying value of 60 South Sixth (located in Minneapolis, Minnesota) to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates which resulted in the future estimated undiscounted cash flows being lower than the net carrying value of the property. The decrease in cash flow projections was primarily due to the continued challenges in the leasing environment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of million to write down the carrying value of 201 Spear Street (located in San Francisco, California) to its estimated fair value as a result of continued market uncertainty due to rising interest rates, increased vacancy rates as a result of slow return to office in San Francisco, additional projected vacancy due to anticipated tenant turnover and further declining values of comparable sales in the market, all of which impacted ongoing cash flow estimates and leasing projections, which resulted in the future estimated undiscounted cash flows being lower than the net carrying value of the property. As a result, 201 Spear Street was valued at substantially less than the outstanding mortgage debt. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the borrower under the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan (the Spear Street Borrower entered into a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction (the Deed-in-Lieu Transaction with the lender of the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan (the Spear Street Lender ). On January 9, 2024, the Spear Street Lender transferred the title of the 201 Spear Street property to a third-party buyer of the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan.

 Through the normal course of operations, the Company has billion of notes payable maturing over the period from the issuance of these financial statements. Considering the current commercial real estate lending environment, this raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of the issuance of these financial statements. In order to refinance, restructure or extend the Company s maturing debt obligations, the Company has been required to reduce the loan commitments and/or make paydowns on certain loans, and the Company may be required to make additional reductions to loan commitments and paydowns on the loans maturing during the next 12 months in order to refinance, restructure or extend those loans. As a result of reductions in loan commitments and paydowns and the ongoing liquidity needs in the Company s real estate portfolio, the Company may consider selling assets into a challenged real estate market in an effort to manage its liquidity needs. Selling real estate assets in the current market would likely adversely impact the ultimate sale price. In addition, the Company continues to evaluate raising capital through the issuance of new equity or debt. The Company may also defer noncontractual expenditures. Additionally, high interest rates, reductions in real estate values and future tenant turnover in the portfolio will have a further impact on the Company s ability to meet loan compliance tests and may further reduce the available liquidity under the Company s loan agreements. See also, Note 2, Going Concern. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s interest expense related to notes payable was million and million, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s interest expense related to notes payable was million and million, respectively, which excludes the impact of interest rate swaps and caps put in place to mitigate the Company s exposure to rising interest rates on its variable rate notes payable. See Note 9, Derivative Instruments. Included in interest expense was the amortization of deferred financing costs of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million of interest expense were payable, respectively.

 The Company s notes payable contain financial debt covenants. As discussed below under Recent Financing Transactions, in connection with short-term extensions of certain loans, the Company s lenders have waived certain financial debt covenants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes it was in compliance with the debt covenants under its notes payable to the extent those covenants were not waived by the lenders. The Company s loan agreements contain cross default provisions, including that the failure of one or more of the Company s subsidiaries to pay debt as it matures under one debt facility may trigger the acceleration of the Company s indebtedness under other debt facilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Almaden Mortgage Loan, the Modified Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility and the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility are subject to cash sweep arrangements, whereby each month the excess cash flow from the properties securing the loan is deposited into a cash management account held for the benefit of the Company s lenders. Generally, excess cash flow means an amount equal to (a) gross revenues from the properties securing the facility less (b) an amount equal to principal and interest paid with respect to the associated debt facility, operating expenses of the properties securing the facility and in certain cases a limited amount of REIT-level expenses. In certain cases, the Company may request disbursements from the cash management accounts. Amounts held in the cash management accounts at each reporting period are included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

10. 
 
 The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes, pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company s financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and for which markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments for which markets are inactive or consist of non-orderly trades. The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly. The following is a summary of the methods and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value: 
 Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, rent and other receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities: These balances approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items.

 10. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) 

Disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company as of the period end and requires a significant amount of judgment. Low levels of transaction volume for certain financial instruments have made the estimation of fair values difficult and, therefore, both the actual results and the Company s estimate of value at a future date could be materially different.

 and , respectively, for the costs of the supplemental coverage obtained by the Company. 
 Asset Management Fees 
 For asset management services, the Company pays the Advisor a monthly fee. With respect to investments in real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75 of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property. This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition expenses related thereto (but excludes acquisition fees paid to the Advisor). In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee is determined based on the Company s proportionate share of the underlying investment (but excluding acquisition fees paid to the Advisor). With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75 of the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination expenses related thereto, but is exclusive of acquisition or origination fees paid to the Advisor) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment (excluding acquisition or origination fees paid to the Advisor), as of the time of calculation. The Company currently does not pay any asset management fees in connection with the Company s investment in the equity securities of the SREIT. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, on November 8, 2022, the Company and the Advisor amended the advisory agreement and commencing with asset management fees accruing from October 1, 2022, the Company paid million of the monthly asset management fee to the Advisor in cash and the Company deposited the remainder of the monthly asset management fee into an interest bearing account in the Company s name, which amounts will be paid to the Advisor from such account solely as reimbursement for payments made by the Advisor pursuant to the Advisor s employee retention program (such account, the Bonus Retention Fund ). The Bonus Retention Fund was established in order to incentivize and retain key employees of the Advisor. The Bonus Retention Fund was fully funded in December 2023 when the Company had deposited million in cash into such account. Following such time, the monthly asset management fee became fully payable in cash to the Advisor. The Advisor has acknowledged and agreed that payments by the Advisor to employees under the Advisor s employee retention program that are reimbursed by the Company from the Bonus Retention Fund will be conditioned on (a) the Company s liquidation and dissolution; (b) a transaction involving the acquisition, merger, conversion or consolidation, either directly or indirectly, of the Company in which (i) the Company is not the surviving entity and (ii) the Advisor is no longer serving as an advisor or asset manager to the surviving entity in such transaction; (c) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company s assets; (d) the non-renewal or termination of the Advisory Agreement without cause; or (e) the termination of the employee without cause. To the extent the Bonus Retention Fund is not fully paid out to employees as set forth above, the Advisory Agreement provides that the residual amount will be deemed additional Deferred Asset Management Fees (defined below) and be treated in accordance with the provisions for payment of Deferred Asset Management Fees. Two of the Company s executive officers, Jeff Waldvogel and Stacie Yamane, and one of the Company s directors, Marc DeLuca, participate in and have been allocated awards under the Advisor s employee retention program, which awards would only be paid as set forth above. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had deposited million of restricted cash into the Bonus Retention Fund and the Company had made any payments to the Advisor from the Bonus Retention Fund.

 million and the Company had not made any payments to the Advisor related to the Deferred Asset Management Fees for the period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2024. The Advisory Agreement also provides that the Company remains obligated to pay the Advisor outstanding Deferred Asset Management Fees in any month to the extent that MFFO for such month exceeds the amount of distributions declared for the record dates of that month (such excess amount, a RMFFO Surplus provided however, that any amount of outstanding Deferred Asset Management Fees in excess of the RMFFO Surplus will continue to be deferred. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued million and million of asset management fees, respectively, of which million were Deferred Asset Management Fees as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and million were related to asset management fees that were restricted for payment and deposited in the Bonus Retention Fund as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Consistent with the prior advisory agreement, the current Advisory Agreement provides that notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all Deferred Asset Management Fees that are unpaid will become immediately due and payable at such time as the Company s stockholders have received, together as a collective group, aggregate distributions (including distributions that may constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes) sufficient to provide (i) an per year cumulative, noncompounded return on such net invested capital (the Stockholders Return and (ii) a return of their net invested capital, or the amount calculated by multiplying the total number of shares purchased by stockholders by the issue price, reduced by any amounts to repurchase shares pursuant to the Company s share redemption program. The Stockholders Return is not based on the return provided to any individual stockholder. Accordingly, it is not necessary for each of the Company s stockholders to have received any minimum return in order for the Advisor to receive Deferred Asset Management Fees.

 periods upon the mutual consent of the Company and the Advisor. The Advisory Agreement may be terminated (i) upon days written notice without cause or penalty by either the Company (acting through the conflicts committee) or the Advisor or (ii) immediately by the Company for cause or upon the bankruptcy of the Advisor. If the Advisory Agreement is terminated without cause, then the Advisor will be entitled to receive from the Company any residual amount of the Bonus Retention Fund deemed to be additional Deferred Asset Management Fees, provided that upon such non-renewal or termination the Company does not retain an advisor in which the Advisor or its affiliates have a majority interest. Upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, all unpaid Deferred Asset Management Fees will automatically be forfeited by the Advisor, and if the Advisory Agreement is terminated for cause, any residual amount of the Bonus Retention Fund deemed to be additional Deferred Asset Management Fees will also automatically be forfeited by the Advisor.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms Company, we, our and us refer to KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership III, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership, and to their subsidiaries. 

Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as may, will, seeks, anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, plans, intends, should or similar expressions. These include statements about our plans, strategies and prospects and these statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. Moreover, you should interpret many of the risks identified in this report, as well as the risks set forth below, as being heightened as a result of the continued disruptions in the financial markets impacting the U.S. commercial real estate industry, especially as it pertains to commercial office buildings. 
 The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
 The ongoing challenges affecting the U.S. commercial real estate industry, especially as it pertains to commercial office buildings, continues to be one of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face. The combination of high interest rates and persistent inflation (or the perception that any of these events may continue), as well as a lack of lending activity in the debt markets, have contributed to considerable weakness in the commercial real estate markets. The usage and leasing activity of our assets in several markets remains lower than pre-pandemic levels in those markets. Upcoming and recent tenant lease expirations and leasing challenges in certain markets amidst the aforementioned headwinds coupled with slower than expected return-to-office, most notably in the greater San Francisco Bay Area where we own several assets, have had direct and material impacts to property appraisal values used by our lenders and have impacted our ability to access certain credit facilities and our ongoing cash flow. 
 As of November 14, 2024, we have 1.0 billion of loan maturities in the next 12 months. Considering the current commercial real estate lending environment, this raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of the issuance of our financial statements. In order to refinance, restructure or extend our maturing debt obligations, we have been required to reduce the loan commitments and/or make paydowns on certain loans, and we may be required to make additional reductions to loan commitments and paydowns on the loans maturing during the next 12 months in order to refinance, restructure or extend those loans. As a result of reductions in loan commitments and paydowns and the ongoing liquidity needs in our real estate portfolio, we may consider selling assets into a challenged real estate market in an effort to manage our liquidity needs. Selling real estate assets in the current market would likely adversely impact the ultimate sale price. In addition, we continue to evaluate raising capital through the issuance of new equity or debt. We may also defer noncontractual expenditures. Moreover, our loan agreements contain cross default provisions, including that the failure of one or more of our subsidiaries to pay debt as it matures under one debt facility may trigger the acceleration of our indebtedness under other debt facilities. If we are unable to successfully refinance or restructure certain of our debt instruments, we may seek the protection of the bankruptcy court to implement a restructuring plan, which would constitute an event of default under other indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As a result of our upcoming loan maturities, reductions in loan commitments and loan paydowns, the challenging commercial real estate lending environment, the current interest rate environment, leasing challenges in certain markets where we own properties, reduction in our cash flows due to elevated interest rates and the lack of transaction volume in the U.S. office market as well as general market instability, management s plans cannot be considered probable and thus do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 We have entered into loan modification and extension agreements with the lenders under the Amended and Restated Portfolio Facility, the outstanding principal balance of which is approximately 601.3 million. The extension agreements require us to satisfy certain conditions, some of which conditions are not in our sole control, including our taking identified actions relating to our portfolio. Our failure to satisfy certain of these conditions will result in an immediate event of default under the loan documents. 
 Continued disruptions in the financial markets and economic uncertainty impacting the U.S. commercial real estate industry could further impact our ability to implement our business strategy and continue as a going concern. Overall, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing and duration of the economic recovery, which precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact the current disruptions in the markets may have on our business. Potential long-term changes in customer behavior, such as continued work-from-home arrangements, could materially and negatively impact the future demand for office space, further adversely impacting our operations. 
 We are unable to predict when or if we will be in a position to pay distributions to our stockholders. Due to certain restrictions and covenants included in one of our loan agreements, we do not expect to pay any dividends or distributions on our common stock during the term of the loan agreement, which matures on March 1, 2026. We have not declared any distributions since June 2023. If and when we pay distributions, we may fund distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings, return of capital or offering proceeds. We have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. 
 Stockholders may have to hold their shares an indefinite period of time. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide additional liquidity to stockholders. Due to certain restrictions and covenants included in one of our loan agreements, we do not expect to redeem any shares of our common stock during the term of the loan agreement, which matures on March 1, 2026. As a result, we terminated our share redemption program on March 15, 2024. 
 Our charter does not require us to liquidate our assets and dissolve by a specified date, nor does our charter require our directors to list our shares for trading by a specified date. No public market currently exists for our shares of common stock. There are limits on the ownership and transferability of our shares. Our shares cannot be readily sold and, if our stockholders are able to sell their shares, they would likely have to sell them at a substantial discount. 
 We are dependent on KBS Capital Advisors LLC KBS Capital Advisors ), our advisor, to conduct our operations. 
 All of our executive officers, our affiliated directors and other key professionals are also officers, affiliated directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor and/or its affiliates. These individuals, our advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including conflicts created by our advisor s and its affiliates compensation arrangements with us and other programs and investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and other programs and investors. These conflicts could result in action or inaction that is not in the best interests of our stakeholders. 
 Our advisor and its affiliates currently receive fees in connection with transactions involving the management and disposition of our investments. Asset management fees are based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to us. We may also pay significant fees during our listing/liquidation stage. Although most of the fees payable during our listing/liquidation stage are contingent on our stockholders first enjoying agreed-upon investment returns, the investment return thresholds may be reduced subject to approval by our conflicts committee and our charter limitations. These payments increase the risk of loss to our stakeholders. 
 We may incur debt until our total liabilities would exceed 75 of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves), and we may exceed this limit with the approval of the conflicts committee of our board of directors. High debt levels would impact our net revenues and could cause our financial condition to suffer. 
 We depend on tenants for the revenue generated by our real estate investments. Revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in occupancy (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases), rent deferrals or abatements, tenants becoming unable to pay their rent, lower rental rates and/or potential changes in customer behavior, such as continued work from home arrangements, making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and causing our operations to suffer.

 Our significant investment in the equity securities of Prime US REIT (the SREIT ), a traded Singapore real estate investment trust, is subject to the risks associated with real estate investments as well as the risks inherent in investing in traded securities, including, in this instance, risks related to the quantity of units held by us relative to the trading volume of the units. Due to the disruptions in the financial markets, the trading price of the common units of the SREIT has experienced substantial volatility and has been significantly impacted by the market sentiment for stock with significant investment in U.S. office buildings. 
 All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

Overview 
 We were formed on December 22, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by our advisor pursuant to an advisory agreement and our advisor conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate investments. Our advisor owns 20,857 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees. 
 We have invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate investments. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 14 office properties, one mixed-use office/retail property and an investment in the equity securities of the SREIT. 
 On February 4, 2010, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares and a maximum of up to 280,000,000 shares, or up to 2,760,000,000 of shares, of common stock for sale to the public, of which up to 200,000,000 shares, or up to 2,000,000,000 of shares, were registered in our primary offering and up to 80,000,000 shares, or up to 760,000,000 of shares, were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on May 29, 2015 and terminated the primary offering on July 28, 2015. 
 We sold 169,006,162 shares of common stock in our now-terminated primary initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of 1.7 billion. We sold 46,154,757 shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of 471.3 million. We have redeemed or repurchased 74,644,349 shares for 789.2 million. On March 15, 2024, we terminated our dividend reinvestment plan and our share redemption program. 
 Additionally, on October 3, 2014, we issued 258,462 shares of common stock, for 2.4 million, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 
 Section 5.11 of our charter requires that we seek stockholder approval of our liquidation if our shares of common stock are not listed on a national securities exchange by September 30, 2020, unless a majority of the conflicts committee of our board of directors, composed solely of all of our independent directors, determines that liquidation is not then in the best interest of our stockholders. Pursuant to our charter requirement, the conflicts committee considered the ongoing challenges affecting the U.S. commercial real estate industry, especially as it pertains to commercial office properties, the challenging interest rate environment and lack of activity in the debt markets, the limited availability in the debt markets for commercial real estate transactions in the office sector, and the lack of transaction volume in the U.S. office market for assets similar in size to those of ours, and on August 12, 2024, our conflicts committee unanimously determined to postpone approval of our liquidation. Section 5.11 of our charter requires that the conflicts committee revisit the issue of liquidation at least annually.

 Going Concern Considerations 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements and condensed notes in this Quarterly Report have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. The ongoing challenges affecting the U.S. commercial real estate industry, especially as it pertains to commercial office buildings, continues to be one of the most significant risks and uncertainties we face. The combination of high interest rates and persistent inflation (or the perception that any of these events may continue), as well as a lack of lending activity in the debt markets, have contributed to considerable weakness in the commercial real estate markets. The usage and leasing activity of our assets in several markets remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, and we cannot predict when economic activity and demand for office space will return to pre-pandemic levels in those markets. Both upcoming and recent tenant lease expirations and leasing challenges in certain markets amidst the aforementioned headwinds coupled with slower than expected return-to-office , most notably in the greater San Francisco Bay Area where we own several assets, have had direct and material impacts to property appraisal values used by our lenders and have impacted our ability to access certain credit facilities and our ongoing cash flow, which, in large part, provide liquidity for capital expenditures needed to manage our real estate assets. 
 Due to disruptions in the financial markets, it is difficult to refinance maturing debt obligations as lenders are hesitant to make new loans in the current market environment with so many uncertainties surrounding asset valuations, especially in the office real estate market. As of November 14, 2024, we have 1.0 billion of loan maturities in the next 12 months. Considering the current commercial real estate lending environment, this raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of the issuance of our financial statements. 
 On February 12, 2024, after running an interview process with several investment banks, we engaged Moelis Company LLC, a global investment bank with expertise in real estate, capital raising and restructuring, to assist us in developing, evaluating and pursuing a comprehensive plan to maximize the value of our assets in a manner that would be beneficial to all of our stakeholders. 
 We are proactively and productively engaged in discussions with our lenders for the modification and extension of our maturing debt obligations, including the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility with an outstanding principal balance of 601.3 million as of November 14, 2024. We have entered into short-term extension and modification agreements for this facility, which has a current maturity date of November 20, 2024. The extension and modification agreements require us to satisfy certain conditions, certain of which are not in our sole control, including our taking identified actions relating to our portfolio. Our failure to satisfy certain of these conditions will result in an immediate event of default under the loan documents. The extension and modification agreements also provide a default will occur under the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility if a written demand for payment is delivered to KBS REIT Properties III LLC, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, by U.S. Bank, National Association following a default under the following loans (a) our Credit Facility, (b) the payment guaranty agreement of our Modified Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility or (c) any other indebtedness of KBS REIT Properties III LLC where the demand made or amount guaranteed is greater than 5.0 million. In addition, the loan modification and extension agreements provide a default will occur under the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility if a written demand for payment following a default is delivered to KBS REIT Properties III LLC by the lenders under our Almaden Mortgage Loan or our Park Place Village Mortgage Loan, in each case where the demand made or amount guaranteed is greater than 5.0 million. 
 In order to refinance, restructure or extend our maturing debt obligations, we have been required to reduce the loan commitments and/or make paydowns on certain loans, and we may be required to make additional reductions to loan commitments and paydowns on the loans maturing during the next 12 months in order to refinance, restructure or extend those loans. As a result of reductions in loan commitments and paydowns and the ongoing liquidity needs in our real estate portfolio, we may consider selling assets into a challenged real estate market in an effort to manage our liquidity needs. Selling real estate assets in the current market would likely adversely impact the ultimate sale price. In addition, we continue to evaluate raising capital through the issuance of new equity or debt. We may also defer noncontractual expenditures.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 There can be no assurances as to the certainty or timing of management s plans in regards to the matters above, as certain elements of management s plans are outside our control, including our ability to successfully refinance, restructure or extend certain of our debt instruments, our ability to sell assets and our ability to raise new equity or debt. Moreover, our loan agreements contain cross default provisions, including that the failure of one or more of our subsidiaries to pay debt as it matures under one debt facility may trigger the acceleration of our indebtedness under other debt facilities. If we are unable to successfully refinance or restructure certain of our debt instruments, we may seek the protection of the bankruptcy court to implement a restructuring plan, which would constitute an event of default under other indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As a result of our upcoming loan maturities, reductions in loan commitments and loan paydowns, the challenging commercial real estate lending environment, the current interest rate environment, leasing challenges in certain markets where we own properties, reduction in our cash flows due to elevated interest rates and the lack of transaction volume in the U.S. office market as well as general market instability, management s plans cannot be considered probable and thus do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Continued disruptions in the financial markets and economic uncertainty impacting the U.S. commercial real estate industry could further impact our ability to implement our business strategy and continue as a going concern. Overall, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing and duration of the economic recovery, which precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact the current disruptions in the markets may have on our business. Potential long-term changes in customer behavior, such as continued work-from-home arrangements, which increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially and negatively impact the future demand for office space, further adversely impacting our operations. 

Market Outlook Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 
 Volatility in global financial markets and changing political environments can cause fluctuations in the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets. Declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space, increased rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows from investment properties. Further, revenues from our properties have decreased and could continue to decrease due to a reduction in occupancy (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases), increased rent deferrals or abatements, tenants being unable to pay their rent and/or lower rental rates. Increases in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates and higher market interest rate spreads has prevented us from refinancing debt obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of the debt we are refinancing and we expect this to continue with upcoming loan maturities. Further, increases in interest rates increase the amount of our debt payments on our variable rate debt to the extent the interest rates on such debt are not fixed through interest rate swap agreements or limited by interest rate caps. Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of real estate investments. The current challenging interest rate environment and lack of financing available in the current environment have had a downward impact on real estate values, especially for commercial office buildings, and these factors have significantly impacted the amount of transaction activity in the commercial real estate market and made valuing such assets increasingly difficult. Management continuously reviews our investment and debt financing strategies to optimize our portfolio and the cost of our debt exposure in this challenging environment. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As described above under Going Concern Considerations, our management determined that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of the issuance of our financial statements. Our principal demands for funds during the short and long-term are and will be for payments (including maturity payments) under debt obligations and operating expenses, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses. As discussed below, due to certain restrictions and covenants on distributions and redemptions included in one of our loan agreements, we do not expect to pay any dividends or distributions or redeem any shares of our common stock during the term of the loan agreement, which matures on March 1, 2026. Our primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements are as follows: 
 Cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments; 
 Debt financings (including any amounts currently available under existing loan facilities); and 
 Proceeds from the sale of our real estate properties and real estate-related investments.

 Our real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures, capital expenditures, debt service payments, the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from our real estate properties is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectability of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures. Due to uncertainties in the U.S. office real estate market, most notably in the greater San Francisco Bay Area where we own certain assets, our cash flows have been and we anticipate tha t our future cash flows from operations may be impacted due to lease rollover and reduced demand for office space. 
 We have also made a significant investment in the common units of the SREIT. Our investment in the equity securities of the SREIT generates cash flow in the form of dividend income, and dividends are typically declared and paid on a semi-annual basis, though dividends are not guaranteed. As of September 30, 2024, we held 237,426,088 units of the SREIT which represented 18.2 of the outstanding units of the SREIT as of that date. Due to the disruptions in the financial markets discussed above, since early March 2020, the trading price of the common units of the SREIT has experienced substantial volatility. The trading price of the common units of the SREIT has been significantly impacted by the market sentiment for stock with significant investment in U.S. commercial office buildings. As of November 14, 2024, the aggregate value of our investment in the units of the SREIT was 36.6 million, which was based solely on the closing price of the units on the SGX-ST of 0.154 per unit as of November 14, 2024, and did not take into account any potential discount for the holding period risk due to the quantity of units we hold. This is a decrease of 0.726 per unit from our initial acquisition of SREIT units at 0.880 per unit on July 19, 2019. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had mortgage debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of 1.6 billion, with a weighted-average remaining term of 0.5 years. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.2 billion of notes payable maturing during the 12 months ending September 30, 2025. Considering the current commercial real estate lending environment, this raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, our debt obligations consisted of 118.8 million of fixed rate notes payable and 1.5 billion of variable rate notes payable. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rates on 1.1 billion of our variable rate notes payable were effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements. 
 We are proactively and productively engaged in discussions with our lenders for the modification and extension of our maturing debt obligations, including the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility with an outstanding principal balance of 601.3 million as of November 14, 2024. We have entered into short-term extension and modification agreements for this facility, which has a current maturity date of November 20, 2024. The extension and modification agreements require us to satisfy certain conditions, some of which conditions are not in our sole control, including our taking identified actions relating to our portfolio. Our failure to satisfy certain of these conditions will result in an immediate event of default under the loan documents. The extension and modification agreements also provide a default will occur under the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility if a written demand for payment is delivered to KBS REIT Properties III LLC, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, by U.S. Bank, National Association following a default under the following loans (a) our Credit Facility, (b) the payment guaranty agreement of our Modified Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility or (c) any other indebtedness of KBS REIT Properties III LLC where the demand made or amount guaranteed is greater than 5.0 million. In addition, the loan modification and extension agreements provide a default will occur under the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility if a written demand for payment following a default is delivered to KBS REIT Properties III LLC by the lenders under our Almaden Mortgage Loan or our Park Place Village Mortgage Loan, in each case where the demand made or amount guaranteed is greater than 5.0 million. 
 In order to refinance, restructure or extend our maturing debt obligations, we have been required to reduce the loan commitments and/or make paydowns on certain loans, and we may be required to make additional reductions to loan commitments and paydowns on the loans maturing during the next 12 months in order to refinance, restructure or extend those loans. As a result of reductions in loan commitments and paydowns and the ongoing liquidity needs in our real estate portfolio, we may consider selling assets into a challenged real estate market in an effort to manage our liquidity needs. Selling real estate assets in the current market would likely adversely impact the ultimate sale price. In addition, we continue to evaluate raising capital through the issuance of new equity or debt. We may also defer noncontractual expenditures.

 There can be no assurances as to the certainty or timing of management s plans in regards to the matters above, as certain elements of management s plans are outside our control, including our ability to successfully refinance, restructure or extend certain of our debt instruments, our ability to sell assets and our ability to raise new equity or debt. Moreover, our loan agreements contain cross default provisions, including that the failure of one or more of our subsidiaries to pay debt as it matures under one debt facility may trigger the acceleration of our indebtedness under other debt facilities. If we are unable to successfully refinance or restructure certain of our debt instruments, we may seek the protection of the bankruptcy court to implement a restructuring plan, which would constitute an event of default under other indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As a result of our upcoming loan maturities, reductions in loan commitments and loan paydowns, the challenging commercial real estate lending environment, the current interest rate environment, leasing challenges in certain markets where we own properties, reduction in our cash flows due to elevated interest rates and the lack of transaction volume in the U.S. office market as well as general market instability, management s plans cannot be considered probable and thus do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 In addition, four of our debt facilities (representing 1.1 billion of our borrowings and 12 of our properties as of November 14, 2024) are subject to cash sweep arrangements, whereby each month the excess cash flow from the properties securing the loan is deposited into a cash management account held for the benefit of our lenders. Generally, excess cash flow means an amount equal to (a) gross revenues from the properties securing the facility less (b) an amount equal to principal and interest paid with respect to the associated debt facility, operating expenses of the properties securing the facility and in certain cases a limited amount of REIT-level expenses. In certain cases, we may request disbursements from the cash management accounts. However, such cash management accounts decrease our operating flexibility. 
 As a result of the current interest rate environment, the recent extensions and refinancings of certain of our loans have reduced our available liquidity and we anticipate that future loan refinancings may further impact our liquidity position due to potential required loan paydowns at extension and increased interest rate spreads. Additionally, we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements that are currently below market and as those swaps expire, our interest expense will increase and further impact our liquidity position and ongoing cash flows. 
 We expect that our debt financing and other liabilities will be between 45 and 65 of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves). There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for the purchase of any single asset. We limit our total liabilities to 75 of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation and other non-cash reserves), meaning that our borrowings and other liabilities may exceed our maximum target leverage of 65 of the cost of our tangible assets without violating these borrowing restrictions. We may exceed the 75 limit only if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. To the extent financing in excess of this limit is available on attractive terms, our conflicts committee may approve debt in excess of this limit. From time to time, our total liabilities could also be below 45 of the cost of our tangible assets due to the lack of availability of debt financing. As of September 30, 2024, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 57 of the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and 60 of the book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. This leverage limitation is based on cost and not fair value, and our leverage may exceed 75 of the fair value of our tangible assets. 
 We have not declared any distributions since June 2023. We have experienced a reduction in our net cash flows from operations in recent periods primarily due to higher interest expense and a decrease in dividend income received from the SREIT. We are unable to predict when or if we will be in a position to pay distributions to our stockholders. Due to certain restrictions and covenants included in one of our loan agreements, we do not expect to pay any dividends or distributions on our common stock during the term of the loan agreement, which matures on March 1, 2026. As a result, on March 15, 2024, we terminated our dividend reinvestment plan. See Going Concern Considerations and Market Outlook Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets herein and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Distribution Information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. 
 We did not redeem any shares of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due to certain restrictions and covenants included in one of our loan agreements, we do not expect to redeem any shares of our common stock during the term of the loan agreement, which matures on March 1, 2026. As a result, we terminated our share redemption program on March 15, 2024.

 Under our charter, we are required to limit our total operating expenses to the greater of 2 of our average invested assets or 25 of our net income for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters, as these terms are defined in our charter, unless the conflicts committee has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Operating expenses for the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024 did not exceed the charter-imposed limitation. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 6.8 million and 37.2 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of higher interest expense, a decrease in dividend income received from the SREIT, the sale of a real estate property in February 2024, an increase in legal fees and financial and advisory consulting fees related to our development and pursuit of our debt restructuring plan and capital raising efforts, and the timing of payments and cash receipts, offset by 6.6 million of interest rate swap settlement proceeds received in 2024 for early terminated swaps. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to 46.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of the McEwen Building, offset by 28.6 million used in improvements to real estate. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 30.0 million and primarily consisted of the following: 
 28.1 million of net cash used in debt financing as a result of principal payments on notes payable of 56.3 million and payments of deferred financing costs of 5.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from notes payable of 33.9 million; and 
 1.9 million of restricted cash surrendered in connection with the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction related to 201 Spear Street. 
 We also expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor. We currently make payments to our advisor in connection with the management of our investments and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us. We also pay fees to our advisor in connection with the disposition of investments. We reimburse our advisor and dealer manager for certain stockholder services. In addition, our advisor is entitled to an incentive fee upon achieving certain performance goals. 
 Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee. With respect to investments in real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75 of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property. This amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition expenses related thereto (but excludes acquisition fees paid to our advisor). In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee is determined based on our proportionate share of the underlying investment (but excluding acquisition fees paid to our advisor). With respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 0.75 of the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment (which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination expenses related thereto but is exclusive of acquisition or origination fees paid to our advisor) and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the acquisition or origination expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment (excluding acquisition or origination fees paid to our advisor), as of the time of calculation. We currently do not pay asset management fees to our advisor on our investment in units of the SREIT.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, on November 8, 2022, we and our advisor amended the advisory agreement and commencing with asset management fees accruing from October 1, 2022, we paid 1.15 million of the monthly asset management fee to our advisor in cash and we deposited the remainder of the monthly asset management fee into an interest bearing account in our name, which amounts will be paid to our advisor from such account solely as reimbursement for payments made by our advisor pursuant to our advisor s employee retention program (such account, the Bonus Retention Fund ). The Bonus Retention Fund was established in order to incentivize and retain key employees of our advisor. The Bonus Retention Fund was fully funded in December 2023, when we had deposited 8.5 million in cash into such account. Following such time the monthly asset management fee became fully payable in cash to our advisor. Our advisor has acknowledged and agreed that payments by our advisor to employees under our advisor s employee retention program that are reimbursed by us from the Bonus Retention Fund will be conditioned on (a) our liquidation and dissolution; (b) a transaction involving the acquisition, merger, conversion or consolidation, either directly or indirectly, of us in which (i) we are not the surviving entity and (ii) our advisor is no longer serving as an advisor or asset manager to the surviving entity in such transaction; (c) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; (d) the non-renewal or termination of the advisory agreement without cause; or (e) the termination of the employee without cause. To the extent the Bonus Retention Fund is not fully paid out to employees as set forth above, the advisory agreement provides that the residual amount will be deemed additional Deferred Asset Management Fees (defined below) and be treated in accordance with the provisions for payment of Deferred Asset Management Fees. Two of our executive officers, Mr. Waldvogel and Ms. Yamane, and one of our directors, Mr. DeLuca, participate in and have been allocated awards under our advisor s employee retention program, which awards would only be paid as set forth above. 
 Prior to amending the advisory agreement in November 2022, the prior advisory agreement had provided that with respect to asset management fees accruing from March 1, 2014, our advisor would defer, without interest, our obligation to pay asset management fees for any month in which our modified funds from operations MFFO for such month, as such term is defined in the practice guideline issued by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives IPA in November 2010 and interpreted by us, excluding asset management fees, did not exceed the amount of distributions declared by us for record dates of that month. We remained obligated to pay our advisor an asset management fee in any month in which our MFFO, excluding asset management fees, for such month exceeded the amount of distributions declared for the record dates of that month (such excess amount, an MFFO Surplus however, any amount of such asset management fee in excess of the MFFO Surplus was deferred under the prior advisory agreement. If the MFFO Surplus for any month exceeded the amount of the asset management fee payable for such month, any remaining MFFO Surplus was applied to pay any asset management fee amounts previously deferred in accordance with the prior advisory agreement. 
 Pursuant to the current advisory agreement, asset management fees accruing from October 1, 2022 are no longer subject to the deferral provision described above. Asset management fees that remained deferred as of September 30, 2022 are Deferred Asset Management Fees. As of September 30, 2022, Deferred Asset Management Fees totaled 8.5 million. The advisory agreement also provides that we remain obligated to pay our advisor outstanding Deferred Asset Management Fees in any month to the extent that MFFO for such month exceeds the amount of distributions declared for the record dates of that month (such excess amount, a RMFFO Surplus provided however, that any amount of outstanding Deferred Asset Management Fees in excess of the RMFFO Surplus will continue to be deferred. We have not made any payments to our advisor related to the Deferred Asset Management Fees for the period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2024. 
 Consistent with the prior advisory agreement, the current advisory agreement provides that notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all Deferred Asset Management Fees that are unpaid will become immediately due and payable at such time as our stockholders have received, together as a collective group, aggregate distributions (including distributions that may constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes) sufficient to provide (i) an 8.0 per year cumulative, noncompounded return on such net invested capital (the Stockholders 8 Return and (ii) a return of their net invested capital, or the amount calculated by multiplying the total number of shares purchased by stockholders by the issue price, reduced by any amounts to repurchase shares pursuant to our share redemption program. The Stockholders 8 Return is not based on the return provided to any individual stockholder. Accordingly, it is not necessary for each of our stockholders to have received any minimum return in order for our advisor to receive Deferred Asset Management Fees.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 In addition, the current advisory agreement provides that any and all Deferred Asset Management Fees that are unpaid will also be immediately due and payable upon the earlier of: 
 (i) a listing of our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange; 
 (ii) our liquidation and dissolution; 
 (iii) a transaction involving the acquisition, merger, conversion or consolidation, either directly or indirectly, of us in which (y) we are not the surviving entity and (z) our advisor is no longer serving as an advisor or asset manager to the surviving entity in such transaction; and 
 (iv) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. 
 The advisory agreement may be terminated (i) upon 60 days written notice without cause or penalty by either us (acting through the conflicts committee) or our advisor or (ii) immediately by us for cause or upon the bankruptcy of our advisor. If the advisory agreement is terminated without cause, then our advisor will be entitled to receive from us any residual amount of the Bonus Retention Fund deemed to be additional Deferred Asset Management Fees, provided that upon such non-renewal or termination we do not retain an advisor in which our advisor or its affiliates have a majority interest. Upon termination of the advisory agreement, all unpaid Deferred Asset Management Fees will automatically be forfeited by our advisor, and if the advisory agreement is terminated for cause, any residual amount of the Bonus Retention Fund deemed to be additional Deferred Asset Management Fees will also automatically be forfeited by our advisor. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued 18.6 million of asset management fees, of which 8.5 million were Deferred Asset Management Fees. Also, included in accrued asset management fees as of September 30, 2024 is 8.5 million of restricted cash deposited into the Bonus Retention Fund. We had not made any payments to our advisor from the Bonus Retention Fund as of September 30, 2024 . 
 Debt Obligations 
 The following is a summary of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands): 
 Payments Due During the Years Ended December 31, Debt Obligations Total Remainder of 2024 2025-2026 2027-2028 Thereafter Outstanding debt obligations (1) 
 1,591,211 1,110,717 480,494 Interest payments on outstanding debt obligations (2) 
 55,253 16,920 38,333 Interest payments on interest rate swaps (3) (4) 
 
 _____________________ 
 (1) Amounts include principal payments only based on maturity dates as of September 30, 2024. The maturity dates of certain loans may be extended beyond their current maturity dates; however, the extension options are subject to certain terms and conditions contained in the loan documents some of which are more stringent than our current loan compliance tests. In order to refinance, restructure or extend our maturing debt obligations, we have been required to reduce the loan commitments and/or make paydowns on certain loans, and we may be required to make additional reductions to loan commitments and paydowns on the loans maturing during the next 12 months in order to refinance, restructure or extend those loans. See the above discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources and Going Concern Considerations. 
 (2) Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts, maturity dates and interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and using interest rate indices as of September 30, 2024, where applicable). We incurred interest expense related to notes payable of 89.9 million, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs totaling 7.8 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have continued to have discussions with our lenders regarding potential modifications to certain debt obligations, including the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility, the Credit Facility and the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan. Given the challenges affecting the U.S. commercial real estate industry and the challenging interest rate environment, in order to refinance or extend loans, we expect lenders to demand higher interest rate spreads compared to the existing terms in our current loan agreements as was the case with the modification of the Modified Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and modification of the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan executed subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 (3) Projected interest payments on interest rate swaps are calculated based on the notional amount, effective term of the swap contract, and fixed rate net of the swapped floating rate in effect as of September 30, 2024. In the case where the swapped floating rate (Fallback SOFR or one-month Term SOFR) at September 30, 2024 is higher than the fixed rate in the swap agreement, interest payments on interest rate swaps in the above debt obligations table would reflect zero as we would not be obligated to make any interest payments on those swaps and instead expect to receive payments from our swap counter-parties. 
 (4) We recognized net realized gains related to interest rate swaps of 19.7 million, excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments of 13.7 million and gains related to swap terminations of 0.2 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2023, we owned 16 office properties, one mixed-use office/retail property and an investment in the equity securities of the SREIT. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we disposed of one office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction and sold one office property. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, we owned 14 office properties, one mixed-use office/retail property and an investment in the equity securities of the SREIT. Therefore, the results of operations presented for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are not directly comparable. The following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

 (1) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the dispositions of properties after July 1, 2023. 
 (2) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to real estate investments owned by us throughout both periods presented. 
 Rental income from our real estate properties decreased from 69.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 63.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lease expirations at a property held throughout both periods, the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024. We expect rental income to decrease in future periods as a result of the disposition of these two properties and to the extent we dispose of additional properties, to vary based on occupancy rates and rental rates of our real estate investments and to the extent of continued uncertainty in the real estate and financial markets and to increase due to tenant reimbursements related to operating expenses to the extent physical occupancy increases as employees return to the office. See Going Concern Considerations, Market Outlook Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets and Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Dividend income from our real estate equity securities decreased from 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in the dividend rate per unit declared by the SREIT. We expect dividend income from our real estate equity securities to vary in future periods based on the occupancy and rental rates of the SREIT s portfolio, movements in interest rates and the underlying liquidity needs of the SREIT.

 Other operating income decreased slightly from 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024, partially offset by an increase in parking revenues at properties held throughout both periods as employees return to the office. We expect other operating income to vary in future periods based on occupancy rates and parking rates at our real estate properties and to the extent of continued uncertainty in the real estate and financial markets and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Operating, maintenance and management costs decreased from 19.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 18.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024, partially offset by an overall increase in repairs and maintenance costs as a result of general inflation and an increase in physical occupancy at properties held throughout both periods. We expect operating, maintenance and management costs to increase in future periods as a result of general inflation and to the extent physical occupancy increases as employees return to the office and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Real estate taxes and insurance increased slightly from 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the increased assessed property value of a real estate property held throughout both periods, offset by the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024. We expect real estate taxes and insurance to vary based on future property tax reassessments for properties that we continue to own and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Asset management fees with respect to our real estate investments decreased from 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024. We expect asset management fees to increase in future periods as a result of any improvements we make to our properties and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. As of September 30, 2024, there were 18.6 million of accrued asset management fees, of which 8.5 million were Deferred Asset Management Fees and 8.5 million were related to asset management fees that were restricted for payment and deposited in the Bonus Retention Fund. For a discussion of Deferred Asset Management Fees and the Bonus Retention Fund, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 
 General and administrative expenses increased from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to legal fees and financial and advisory consulting fees related to our development and pursuit of our debt restructuring plan and capital raising efforts. General and administrative costs consisted primarily of portfolio legal fees, board of directors fees, third party transfer agent fees, financial and advisory consulting fees and audit costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain elevated in the future due to higher portfolio legal fees and consulting fees we expect to incur in 2024. 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased from 29.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 27.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024. We expect depreciation and amortization to increase in future periods as a result of additional capital improvements, offset by a decrease in amortization related to fully amortized tenant origination and absorption costs and to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Interest expense increased from 31.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 32.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Included in interest expense was (i) 30.1 million and 30.3 million of interest expense payments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and (ii) the amortization of deferred financing costs of 1.0 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher one-month BSBY and one-month Term SOFR during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the impact on interest expense related to our variable rate debt, a higher fixed interest rate on the Almaden Mortgage Loan, which became effective in December 2023, additional revolver draws and recent loan modifications which have resulted in additional loan fees being amortized to interest expense in 2024, partially offset by less interest expense incurred as a result of the disposition of an office property and related forgiveness of debt in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024. In general, we expect interest expense to vary based on fluctuations in interest rates (for our variable rate debt) and the amount of future borrowings or loan paydowns and to increase if interest rate spreads are higher when we refinance our existing loans.

 We recorded net loss on derivative instruments of 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Included in net loss on derivative instruments was unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of 21.2 million, offset by realized gain on interest rate swaps of 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded net gain on derivative instruments of 12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Included in net gain on derivative instruments was unrealized gain on interest rate swaps of 3.6 million and realized gain on interest rate swaps of 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net loss (gain) on derivative instruments was primarily due to changes in fair values with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges during the three months ended September 30, 2024. In general, we expect net gains or losses on derivative instruments to vary based on fair value changes with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges. In addition, as the remaining lives of our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges decrease, we expect the fair values of these interest rate swaps to move towards zero, decreasing the net gains or losses on derivative instruments. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of 6.8 million to write down the carrying value of 60 South Sixth (located in Minneapolis, Minnesota) to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates which resulted in the future estimated undiscounted cash flows being lower than the net carrying value of the property. The decrease in cash flow projections was primarily due to the continued challenges in the leasing environment. We did not record any non-cash impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an unrealized gain on real estate equity securities of 16.6 million and unrealized loss on real estate equity securities of 15.5 million, respectively, as a result of the change in the closing price of the units of the SREIT on the SGX-ST.

 Rental income from our real estate properties decreased from 200.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 193.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024, the sale of a real property in February 2024 and lease expirations at a property held throughout both periods , partially offset by lease commencements and the reversal of previously reserved accounts receivable that are no longer doubtful of collection at properties held throughout both pe riods. We expect rental income to decrease in future periods as a result of the disposition of these two properties and to the extent we dispose of additional properties, to vary based on occupancy rates and rental rates of our real estate investments and to the extent of continued uncertainty in the real estate and financial markets and to increase due to tenant reimbursements related to operating expenses to the extent physical occupancy increases as employees return to the office. See Going Concern Considerations, Market Outlook Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets and Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Dividend income from our real estate equity securities decreased from 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a decrease in the dividend rate per unit declared by the SREIT. We expect dividend income from our real estate equity securities to vary in future periods based on the occupancy and rental rates of the SREIT s portfolio, movements in interest rates and the underlying liquidity needs of the SREIT. 
 Other operating income decreased slightly from 13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024, partially offset by an increase in parking revenues at properties held throughout both periods as employees return to the office. We expect other operating income to vary in future periods based on occupancy rates and parking rates at our real estate properties and to the extent of continued uncertainty in the real estate and financial markets and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Operating, maintenance and management costs decreased from 55.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 53.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily due to the disposition of an office pr operty in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024, partially offset by an overall increase in repairs and maintenance costs and operating costs, including janitorial and utilities, as a result of general inflation and an increase in physical occupancy at properties held throughout both periods. We expect operating, maintenance and management costs to increase in future periods as a result of general inflation and to the extent physical occupancy increases as employees return to the office and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Real estate taxes and insurance decreased from 40.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 37.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024, the sale of a real property in February 2024 and a decrease in real estate taxes as a result of property tax refunds received and successful property tax appeals related to properties held throughout both periods, partially offset by the increased assessed property value of a real estate property held throughout both periods. We expect real estate taxes and insurance to vary based on future property tax reassessments for properties that we continue to own and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Asset management fees decreased from 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024, partially offset by an increase due to capital improvements at our real estate properties. We expect asset management fees to increase in future periods as a result of any improvements we make to our properties and to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties. As of September 30, 2024, there were 18.6 million of accrued asset management fees, of which 8.5 million were Deferred Asset Management Fees and 8.5 million were related to asset management fees that were restricted for payment and deposited in the Bonus Retention Fund. For a discussion of Deferred Asset Management Fees and the Bonus Retention Fund, see Liquidity and Capital Resources herein. 
 General and administrative expenses increased from 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to legal fees and financial and advisory consulting fees related to our development and pursuit of our debt restructuring plan and capital raising efforts. General and administrative costs consisted primarily of portfolio legal fees, board of directors fees, third party transfer agent fees, financial and advisory consulting fees and audit costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain elevated in the future due to higher portfolio legal fees and consulting fees we expect to incur in 2024.

 Depreciation and amortization decreased from 86.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 83.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the disposition of an office property in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024, partially offset by the acceleration of amortization for an early lease termination and an increase in capital improvements as a result of lease commencements at a property held throughout both periods. We expect depreciation and amortization to increase in future periods as a result of additional capital improvements, offset by a decrease in amortization related to fully amortized tenant origination and absorption costs and to the extent we dispose of properties. 
 Interest expense increased from 87.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 97.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in interest expense was (i) 84.0 million and 89.9 million of interest expense payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and (ii) the amortization of deferred financing costs of 3.1 million and 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher one-month BSBY and one-month Term SOFR during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the impact on interest expense related to our variable rate debt, a higher fixed interest rate on the Almaden Mortgage Loan, which became effective in December 2023, additional revolver draws and recent loan modifications which have resulted in additional loan fees being amortized to interest expense in 2024, partially offset by less interest expense incurred as a result of the disposition of an office property and related forgiveness of debt in connection with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction in January 2024 and the sale of a real property in February 2024. In general, we expect interest expense to vary based on fluctuations in interest rates (for our variable rate debt) and the amount of future borrowings or loan paydowns and to increase if interest rate spreads are higher when we refinance our existing loans. 
 We recorded net gain on derivative instruments of 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Included in net gain on derivative instruments was (i) realized gain on interest rate swaps of 19.7 million, (ii) gains related to swap terminations of 0.2 million, and offset by (iii) unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded net gain on derivative instruments of 32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in net gain on derivative instruments was (i) realized gain on interest rate swaps of 22.9 million, (ii) unrealized gain on interest rate swaps of 9.3 million, and offset by (iii) fair value loss on interest rate cap of 25,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net gain on derivative instruments was primarily due to changes in fair values with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In general, we expect net gains or losses on derivative instruments to vary based on fair value changes with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges. In addition, as the remaining lives of our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges decrease, we expect the fair values of these interest rate swaps to move towards zero, decreasing the net gains or losses on derivative instruments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of 6.8 million to write down the carrying value of 60 South Sixth (located in Minneapolis, Minnesota) to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates which resulted in the future estimated undiscounted cash flows being lower than the net carrying value of the property. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of 45.5 million to write down the carrying value of 201 Spear Street (located in San Francisco, California) to its estimated fair value as a result of continued market uncertainty due to rising interest rates, increased vacancy rates as a result of slow return to office in San Francisco, additional projected vacancy due to anticipated tenant turnover and further declining values of comparable sales in the market, all of which impacted ongoing cash flow estimates and leasing projections, which resulted in the future estimated undiscounted cash flows being lower than the net carrying value of the property. As a result, 201 Spear Street was valued at substantially less than the outstanding mortgage debt. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, the borrower under the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan (the Spear Street Borrower entered into a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction with the lender of the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan (the Spear Street Lender ). On January 9, 2024, the Spear Street Lender transferred the title of the 201 Spear Street property to a third-party buyer of the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an unrealized loss on real estate equity securities of 7.4 million and 57.6 million, respectively, as a result of the change in the closing price of the units of the SREIT on the SGX-ST.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of 56.4 million in connection with the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction related to the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan. The gain on extinguishment of debt related to the 201 Spear Street Mortgage Loan represents the difference between the carrying amount of the outstanding debt and other liabilities of approximately 128.7 million and the carrying value of the real estate property and other assets of approximately 72.3 million, at the time of the transfer of the 201 Spear Street property and other assets in satisfaction of the loan. We did not record any gain on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We recognized a gain on sale of real estate of 14.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the disposition of the McEwen Building in February 2024. We did not dispose of any real estate during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
 We believe that funds from operations FFO is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT definition. FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), gains and losses from change in control, impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition, we elected the option to exclude mark-to-market changes in value recognized on real estate equity securities in the calculation of FFO. We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs. However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. 
 Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO. As a result, our management also uses MFFO as an indicator of our ongoing performance. MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses (to the extent that such fees and expenses have been recorded as operating expenses); adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above and below market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges. We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the IPA in November 2010 as interpreted by management. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do. 
 We believe that MFFO is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes other non-operating items included in FFO. MFFO excludes non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue. Additionally, we believe that MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance. MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs. MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 FFO and MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP. Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO and MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above. Accordingly, FFO and MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance. In addition, FFO and MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity. We believe FFO and MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures. See also Going Concern Considerations, Market Outlook Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets and Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 During periods of significant disposition activity, FFO and MFFO are much more limited measures of future performance as neither FFO nor MFFO reflects adjustments for the operations of properties sold or under contract to sale during the periods presented. 
 Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of adjustments for straight-line rent, the amortization of above- and below-market leases, gain from extinguishment of debt, unrealized losses (gains) on derivative instruments and gains related to swap terminations are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented. We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations: 
 Adjustments for straight-line rent. These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease. We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period; 
 Amortization of above- and below-market leases. Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue. Since market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate; 
 Gain from extinguishment of debt . A gain from extinguishment of debt represents the difference between the carrying value of any consideration transferred to the lender in return for the extinguishment of a debt and the net carrying value of the debt at the time of settlement. We have excluded the gain from extinguishment of debt in our calculation of MFFO because these gains do not impact the current operating performance of our investments and do not provide an indication of future operating performance; 
 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivative instruments. These adjustments include unrealized losses (gains) from mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swaps and the interest rate cap. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps and the interest rate cap not designated as a hedge are non-cash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense. We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap; and 
 Gains related to swap terminations. Gains related to swap terminations represent the difference between the settlement fees received and the value of interest rate swaps terminated, which are included in net (gain) loss on derivative instruments. Although these amounts increase net income, we exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately reflect the ongoing impact of our interest rate swap agreements.

 Our calculation of FFO, which we believe is consistent with the calculation of FFO as defined by NAREIT, is presented in the following table, along with our calculation of MFFO, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands). No conclusions or comparisons should be made from the presentation of these periods.

 FFO and MFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC. There have been no significant changes to our policies during 2024. 

Subsequent Events 
 We evaluate subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 Purchase and Sale Agreement for Sale of Preston Commons 
 On June 19, 2013, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, acquired three office buildings containing 427,799 rentable square feet located on approximately 6.3 acres of land in Dallas, Texas Preston Commons ). On October 9, 2024, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a purchase and sale agreement and escrow instructions (the Preston Commons Agreement for the sale of Preston Commons to a purchaser unaffiliated with us or our advisor (the Purchaser ). Pursuant to the Preston Commons Agreement, the sale price for Preston Commons is 151.0 million, subject to prorations and adjustments as provided in the Preston Commons Agreement. 
 The closing date is expected to occur on or before November 25, 2024. There can be no assurance that we will complete the sale of Preston Commons. The Purchaser would be obligated to purchase Preston Commons only after satisfaction of agreed upon closing conditions. In some circumstances, if the Purchaser fails to complete the acquisition, it may forfeit up to 3.0 million of earnest money.

 Sixth Modification of the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility 
 On October 11, 2024, we, through certain of our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility Borrowers ), entered into a sixth loan modification and extension agreement (the Sixth Extension Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the Agent and the current lenders under the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility, which are Bank of America, N.A.; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association; U.S. Bank, National Association; Capital One, National Association; PNC Bank, National Association; Regions Bank; and Zions Bankcorporation, N.A., DBA California Bank Trust (together, the Portfolio Loan Lenders ). The Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility is secured by 60 South Sixth, Preston Commons, Sterling Plaza, Towers at Emeryville, Ten Almaden and Town Center (the Portfolio Loan Properties ). 
 Pursuant to the Sixth Extension Agreement, the maturity date of the facility was extended to November 20, 2024. The Sixth Extension Agreement requires us to satisfy certain conditions, some of which conditions are not in our sole control, including our taking identified actions relating to our portfolio. The failure of us to satisfy certain of these conditions will result in an immediate event of default under the loan documents. 
 The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility was approximately 601.3 million as of October 11, 2024. 
 The Sixth Extension Agreement waived certain milestones initially included in the fourth and fifth extension agreements, including the requirement for us to raise not less than 100,000,000 in new equity, debt or a combination of both. 
 Under the Sixth Extension Agreement, the Agent and the Portfolio Loan Lenders waived the requirement for the Portfolio Loan Properties to satisfy the minimum required ongoing debt service coverage ratio through the then current maturity date under the loan documents and waived the requirement for KBS REIT Properties III LLC, as guarantor, to satisfy a net worth covenant through the then current maturity date under the loan documents. 
 Pursuant to the Sixth Extension Agreement, the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility Borrowers also agreed (a) to pay the Portfolio Loan Lenders a non-refundable fee in the amount of 250,000, and (b) to pay the Agent certain costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with the Sixth Extension Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Extension Agreement, the Portfolio Loan Lenders agreed to modify the timing of the payment of the exit fee in the amount of 1.0 million due to the Portfolio Loan Lenders to the earliest to occur of the maturity date, the occurrence of certain triggering events under the loan documents and the repayment of the loan in full. 
 Amendment to the Advisory Agreement 
 As required by the Sixth Extension Agreement, on October 11, 2024, we and our advisor entered into an amendment to the advisory agreement between the parties to reduce and defer until December 1, 2025 certain transaction-based compensation in an amount of approximately 0.5 million that may be payable to our advisor. 
 Third Modification of the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan 
 On November 2, 2020, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary (the Accenture Tower Borrower ), entered into a loan facility with U.S. Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the Agent ), joint lead arranger and co-book runner; Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and co-book runner; and each of the financial institutions signatory thereto as lenders (as amended and modified, the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan ). The current lenders under the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan are U.S. Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A., Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG and the National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. Grand Caymans Branch (the Accenture Tower Lenders ). The Accenture Tower Revolving Loan is secured by Accenture Tower. 
 On November 1, 2024, we, through the Accenture Tower Borrower, entered into a third modification agreement with the Accenture Tower Lenders (the Third Modification Agreement to (i) extend the maturity date of the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan to December 10, 2024 and (ii) remove any prior right of the Accenture Tower Borrower to exercise an additional 12-month extension option. Under the Third Modification Agreement, the Agent and the Accenture Tower Lenders waived the requirement for KBS REIT Properties III LLC as guarantor to satisfy the net worth covenant, the leverage ratio covenant and the EBITDA to fixed charges ratio covenant for all periods following November 1, 2024 through the extended maturity date of December 10, 2024. As of November 1, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan was 306.0 million, which consisted of 229.5 million of term debt and 76.5 million of revolving debt. We continue to work with the Accenture Tower Lenders to reach a longer-term extension of the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan, though there can be no assurance as to the certainty or timing of our plans.

 Fourth Modification of Credit Facility 
 On November 5, 2024, KBS REIT Properties III LLC entered into the fourth modification of the Credit Facility (the Credit Facility Fourth Modification Agreement with U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent (the Credit Facility Agent ). The current lenders under the Credit Facility are U.S. Bank National Association and Bank of America, N.A. (the Credit Facility Lenders ). 
 The Credit Facility Fourth Modification Agreement amends the maturity date of the loan to the earliest to occur of (i) November 15, 2024 and (ii) the date on which the aggregate commitment under the facility is reduced to zero or is otherwise terminated. Pursuant to the Credit Facility Fourth Modification Agreement, the Credit Facility Agent and Credit Facility Lenders waived the requirement for KBS REIT Properties III LLC to comply with the maximum leverage ratio, minimum consolidated net worth requirement, minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum liquidity requirement from December 31, 2023 through and including the current maturity date. 
 Fifth Modification and Extension of the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan 
 On November 6, 2024, we, through certain of our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers and KBS REIT Properties III LLC entered into the fifth modification and extension agreement of the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan (the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and lender (the 3001 3003 Washington Lender ). Pursuant to the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification, the 3001 3003 Washington Lender agreed to extend the maturity date of the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan to May 6, 2026. Additionally, pursuant to the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification, effective November 6, 2024, the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan bears interest at one-month Term SOFR plus 290 basis points plus a SOFR margin adjustment of 10 basis points and monthly payments are interest only. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan was approximately 138.8 million as of November 6, 2024. 
 The 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification requires that 100 of excess cash flow from 3001 Washington Boulevard and 3003 Washington Boulevard be deposited monthly into a cash collateral account (the 3001 3003 Washington Cash Sweep Collateral Account ). Funds may not be withdrawn from the 3001 3003 Washington Cash Sweep Collateral Account without the prior written consent of the 3001 3003 Washington Lender. The 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification provides that, subject to the requirements contained therein, the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers will be permitted to withdraw funds from the 3001 3003 Washington Cash Sweep Collateral Account to pay or reimburse the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers for approved tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capital improvements and for operating shortfalls related to the Washington Properties to the extent they occur in any month. Additionally, to the extent the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers do not meet certain conditions, the 3001 3003 Washington Lender has the right to withdraw funds from the 3001 3003 Washington Cash Sweep Collateral Account and apply such funds to any due and payable obligations of the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers. 
 The 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification provides that on or prior to November 15, 2024 (unless extended by the 3001 3003 Washington Lender), we will cause certain of the equity interests of our subsidiaries that own the Carillon property to be pledged to the 3001 3003 Washington Lender as security for all of the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers obligations under the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan and the failure to do so constitutes an immediate default under the loan documents. Further, in the event of the sale of the Carillon property, certain excess proceeds from such sale must be used to repay the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan. 
 The 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification also provides that, among other conditions, if elected by the 3001 3003 Washington Lender, a default will occur under the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan if (i) an event of default occurs under the Carillon Mortgage Loan or (ii) a written demand for payment following a default is delivered to REIT Properties III under the terms of any indebtedness of REIT Properties III, where the demand made or amount guaranteed is greater than 5.0 million. 
 Pursuant to the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan Fifth Modification, a loan fee of 0.4 million is owed to the 3001 3003 Washington Lender, which loan fee is deferred and will be due upon the earliest to occur of the maturity date and the repayment of the loan in full. Additionally, the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers agreed to pay the 3001 3003 Washington Lender an exit fee in the amount of 1.0 million, which is due on the earliest to occur of the maturity date and the repayment of the loan in full, provided that the exit fee is automatically waived if the 3001 3003 Washington Borrowers repay the loan on or before December 15, 2025.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

 We are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund property improvements, repairs and tenant build-outs to properties, to pay for other capital needs, to refinance existing indebtedness and to provide working capital. We have also funded distributions to stockholders and redemptions of common stock with borrowings. Our profitability and the value of our real estate investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We may manage interest rate risk by utilizing a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for other capital needs and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. 
 We borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt, unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 119.3 million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was 118.8 million. The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loan was originated as of September 30, 2024. As we expect to hold our fixed rate instruments to maturity (unless the property securing the debt is sold and the loan is repaid) and the amounts due under such instruments would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our operations. 
 Conversely, movements in interest rates on our variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of variable rate instruments. As of September 30, 2024, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on 372.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding after giving consideration to the impact of interest rate swap agreements on approximately 1.1 billion of our variable rate debt. Based on interest rates as of September 30, 2024, if interest rates were 100 basis points higher or lower during the 12 months ending September 30, 2025, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease by 3.7 million. 
 The interest rate and weighted-average effective interest rate of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 were 7.5 and 5.6 , respectively. The weighted-average effective interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2024 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps, if applicable), using interest rate indices as of September 30, 2024 where applicable. 
 We continue to have discussions with our lenders regarding potential modifications to certain debt obligations, including the Amended and Restated Portfolio Loan Facility, the Credit Facility and the Accenture Tower Revolving Loan. Given the challenges affecting the U.S. commercial real estate industry and the challenging interest rate environment, in order to refinance or extend loans, we expect lenders to demand higher interest rate spreads compared to the existing terms in our current loan agreements as was the case with the modification of the Modified Portfolio Revolving Loan Facility executed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and modification of the 3001 3003 Washington Mortgage Loan subsequent to September 30, 2024. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk, and in particular fluctuations in the variable rate, namely SOFR, but these interest rate swaps will not mitigate any risk related to higher interest rate spreads. Additionally, we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements that are currently below market and as those swaps expire, our interest expense will increase and further impact our liquidity position and ongoing cash flows. As a result, we expect interest expense and our weighted-average effective interest rate to increase in the future as a result of recent extensions and as we continue to refinance our maturing debt. For a discussion of the interest rate risks related to the current capital and credit markets, see Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Outlook Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets and the risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (continued) 

 We are exposed to financial market risk with respect to our investment in the SREIT (SGX-ST Ticker: OXMU). Financial market risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in our investment s security price. Our exposure to changes in security prices is a result of our investment in these types of securities. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, therefore, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from our carrying value. Fluctuation in the market prices of a security may result from any number of factors, including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments, interest rates, default rates and general market conditions. The SREIT s units were first listed for trading on the SGX-ST on July 19, 2019. If an active trading market for the units does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult to sell our units. The market for Singapore REITs may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of our investment in the SREIT difficult. Even if an active trading market develops or we are able to negotiate block trades, if we or other significant investors sell or are perceived as intending to sell a substantial amount of units in a short period of time, the market price of our remaining units could be adversely affected. In addition, as a foreign equity investment, the trading price of units of the SREIT may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in the Singapore and Asian markets, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies. Furthermore, we may be limited in our ability to sell our investment in the SREIT if our advisor and/or its affiliates are deemed to have material, non-public information regarding the SREIT. Charles J. Schreiber, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer, our President and our affiliated director, is a former director of the external manager of the SREIT, and Mr. Schreiber currently holds an indirect ownership interest in the external manager of the SREIT. An affiliate of our advisor serves as the U.S. asset manager to the SREIT. We do not currently engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our investment s security price risk. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 237,426,088 units of the SREIT which represented 18.2 of the outstanding units of the SREIT as of that date. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate value of our investment in the units of the SREIT was 44.4 million, which was based solely on the closing price of the SREIT units on the SGX-ST of 0.187 per unit as of September 30, 2024, and did not take into account any potential discount for the holding period risk due to the quantity of units held by us relative to the normal level of trading volume in the units. This is a decrease of 0.693 per unit from our initial acquisition of SREIT units at 0.880 per unit on July 19, 2019. Due to the disruptions in the financial markets, since early March 2020, the trading price of the common units of the SREIT has experienced substantial volatility. The trading price of the common units of SREIT has been significantly impacted by the market sentiment for stock with significant investment in U.S. commercial office buildings. Based solely on the closing price per unit of the SREIT units as of September 30, 2024, if prices were to increase or decrease by 10 , our net income would increase or decrease by approximately 4.4 million.

 12. Release . 
 (a) Borrowers and Guarantor, for themselves and for each of their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, hereby release and waive all claims and or defenses they now may have against Administrative Agent, Lenders and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the Released Parties on account of any occurrence relating to the Loan, the Loan Documents and or the property encumbered by the Security Instruments which accrued prior to the date hereof, including, but not limited to, any claim that Administrative Agent or any Lender (i) breached any obligation to Borrowers and or Guarantor in connection with the Loan, (ii) was or is in any way involved with Borrowers and or Guarantor as a partner, joint venturer, or in any other capacity whatsoever other than as a lender, (iii) failed to fund any portion of the Loan or any other sums as required under any document or agreement in reference thereto, or (iv) failed to timely respond to any offers to cure any defaults under any document or agreement executed by Borrowers, Guarantor or any third party or parties in favor of Administrative Agent or any Lender (collectively, the Released Claims ).

 (c) Borrowers and Guarantor, each having consulted with counsel, is aware of the contents of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California. Section 1542 reads as follows 
 Section 1542. (General Release Claims Extinguished.) A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 
 5 

Borrowers and Guarantor each expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits under that section and any law or legal principle of similar effect in any jurisdiction, with respect to the Released Claims. Borrowers and Guarantor have executed this Agreement voluntarily, with full knowledge of its significance, and with the express intention of effecting the legal consequences provided by a waiver of California Civil Code Section 1542. 
 13. Course of Dealing . Administrative Agent, Lenders and Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree that at no time shall any prior or subsequent course of conduct by Borrowers, Administrative Agent or any Lender directly or indirectly limit, impair or otherwise adversely affect any of Administrative Agent s or any Lender s rights, interests or remedies in connection with the Loan and the Loan Documents or obligate Administrative Agent or any Lender to agree to, or to negotiate or consider an agreement to, any waiver of any obligation or default by Borrowers under any Loan Document or any amendment to any term or condition of any Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Obligors acknowledge and agree that the existence of the Cash Sweep Collateral Account and Borrower s obligation to deposit funds therein at a time or at times after the Maturity Date shall not imply that the term of the Loan is or will be extended beyond the Maturity Date. Administrative Agent and Lenders have no obligation to, and may not, extend the term of the Loan beyond the Maturity Date.

Borrowers hereby reaffirm the Obligations and promise to pay and perform all Obligations in accordance with the Loan Documents (as expressly modified by this Agreement). The Liens are hereby ratified and confirmed as valid, subsisting and continuing to secure the Obligations. Nothing herein shall in any manner diminish, impair, waive or extinguish the Note, the Loan Documents, the Obligations or the Liens. The execution and delivery of this Agreement shall not constitute a novation of the debt evidenced and secured by the Loan Documents. 
 15. Default . A default under this Agreement shall constitute a default under the Note and other Loan Documents, subject to any applicable notice and cure or grace period expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. For avoidance of doubt, this Agreement is a Loan Document. 
 16. Miscellaneous . To the extent of any conflict between the Loan Documents and this Agreement, this Agreement shall control. Unless specifically modified hereby, all terms of the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement (a) shall bind and benefit the parties hereto and their respective heirs, beneficiaries, administrators, executors, receivers, trustees, successors and assigns (b) shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and United States federal law and (c) may be executed in several counterparts, and by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, and each counterpart, when executed and delivered, shall constitute an original agreement enforceable against all who signed it without production of or accounting for any other counterpart, and all separate counterparts shall constitute the same agreement. 
 17. Reaffirmation of Guaranty . Guarantor, by signature below as such, for valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, hereby consents to and joins in this Agreement and hereby declares to and agrees with Administrative Agent and Lenders that the Guaranty is and shall continue in full force and effect for the benefit of Administrative Agent and Lenders with respect to the Obligations, as amended by this Agreement, that there are no offsets, claims, counterclaims, cross-claims or defenses of Guarantor with respect to the Guaranty nor, to Guarantor s knowledge, with respect to the Obligations, that the Guaranty is not released, diminished or impaired in any way by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the Guaranty is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects. Guarantor hereby reaffirms all of the representations and warranties set forth in the Guaranty, except to the extent such representations and warranties are matters which, by their nature, can no longer be true and correct as a result of the passage of time, and except for changes in circumstances arising from actions or 
 6 

events occurring after the date of the Guaranty that do not otherwise constitute a Default thereunder. Guarantor acknowledges that without this consent and reaffirmation, Administrative Agent and Lenders would not execute this Agreement or otherwise consent to its terms. 
 18. Electronic Signatures . This Agreement may be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures (including, without limitation, facsimile and .pdf) and shall be considered an original, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record. For purposes hereof, Electronic Record and Electronic Signature shall have the meanings assigned to them, respectively, by 15 USC 7006, as it may be amended from time to time. Borrowers and Guarantor hereby agree that as soon as reasonably possible, Borrowers and Guarantor will provide an original of this Agreement to Administrative Agent that will include the wet signatures of Borrowers and Guarantor next to any Electronic Signatures. 
 19. Limited Recourse Provision . Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any recourse against, nor shall there be any personal liability to, the members, shareholders, partners, beneficial interest holders or any other entity or person in the ownership (directly or indirectly) of any Borrower with respect to the obligations of any Borrower and Guarantor under the Loan. For purposes of clarification, in no event shall the above language limit, reduce or otherwise affect any Borrower s liability or obligations under the Loan Documents, Guarantor s liability or obligations under the Guaranty, or Administrative Agent s and each Lender s right to exercise any rights or remedies against any collateral securing the Loan.

Such fifteen (15) day period shall not be construed as in any way extending the due date of any payment. The late charge is imposed for the purpose of defraying the expenses of a Lender incident to handling such defaulting payment. This charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other amount that Lenders may be entitled to receive or action that Administrative Agent and Lenders may be authorized to take as a result of such late payment, including any other remedy Lenders may have and any fees and charges of any agents or attorneys which Administrative Agent or, subject to the provisions of Section 4.15 , Lenders may employ upon the occurrence of a Default, whether authorized herein or by Law.

 5. Prepayment . Section 1.5 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows 
 1.5 Prepayment. 
 (a) Borrowers may, upon notice to Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay the outstanding Principal Debt, in whole or in part without premium or penalty, but subject to compliance with Section 1.5(c) and 2.6 , provided that (i) such notice must be in a form acceptable to Administrative Agent and be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11 00 a.m. Administrative Agent s Time (A) two (2) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Monthly SOFR Principal, (B) and on the date of prepayment of any Base Rate Principal, if any and (ii) any prepayment of Monthly SOFR Principal shall be in a principal amount of 2,000,000 or a whole multiple of 1,000,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount of the Loan then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender s Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by Borrowers, Borrowers shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of the Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any other sums which have become due to Administrative Agent and Lenders under the Loan Documents on or before the date of prepayment but have not been paid . Subject to Section 8.13 , each such prepayment shall be applied to the Loan obligations owing to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Loan Document, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing as of the date that any prepayment is made, Administrative Agent may apply such prepayment to all or such portions of the Indebtedness as Administrative Agent determines in its sole discretion. 
 (b) No yield maintenance premium or other premium or penalty shall be due in connection with any prepayment made pursuant to this Section 1.5 , provided that Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent, concurrently with such prepayment, all Consequential Losses, and all other sums due pursuant to the Loan Documents in connection with such prepayment. 
 EXHIBIT A (SOFR) - PAGE 4 

(c) Any principal prepayment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be applied (i) first, to the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan until such outstanding principal balance has been repaid in full, and (ii) second, to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan provided, any prepayment of the Term Loan shall be specified by Borrowers in writing.

 1.6 Payment Schedule and Maturity Date . The entire principal balance of the Loan then unpaid, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. Prior to maturity, accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable in arrears on the first (1 st Business Day of each month, subject to a ten (10) calendar day grace period in each instance. For the avoidance of doubt, an interest payment will not be considered delinquent or in default, so long as it is received by Administrative Agent on or before the earlier of the Maturity Date or the tenth (10 th calendar day after it is due and payable. No late charge, default interest or similar charge will apply during such grace period. No grace period shall apply to any amounts due and payable on the Maturity Date. 
 7. Illegality . Section 2.2 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows 
 2.2 Illegality . If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loan advances whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR or Monthly SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Monthly SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to Borrowers (through Administrative Agent), any obligation of such Lender to maintain Monthly SOFR Principal shall be suspended, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice and demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrowers at their option shall either prepay or convert all Monthly SOFR Principal owed to such Lender to Base Rate Principal provided , however , if and to the extent such Lender has determined that a Law has made it unlawful to convert all such Monthly SOFR Principal to Base Rate Principal, or any Governmental Authority has asserted that such a conversion is unlawful, Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay all such Monthly SOFR Principal owed to such Lender. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted , together with any additional amounts, if any, required pursuant to Section 2.6 . 
 8. Inability to Determine Rates . Section 2.3 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows 
 2.3 Inability to Determine Rates . If (a) Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) no Successor Rate for Monthly SOFR has been determined in accordance with Section 2.4 , and the circumstances under Section 2.4(a) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable) with respect to SOFR or Monthly SOFR, or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining SOFR or Monthly SOFR for any determination date(s) or requested payment period, as applicable, with respect to any proposed or existing advance of the Loan or (b) Administrative Agent or Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Monthly SOFR for any determination date(s) does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding or maintaining any proposed or existing advance of the Loan, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of Lenders to maintain Monthly SOFR Principal shall be suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent, or, in the case of a determination by Required 
 EXHIBIT A (SOFR) - PAGE 5 

Lenders described in clause (b) above, until Administrative Agent, upon instruction of Required Lenders, revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (1) Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a borrowing at the Monthly SOFR Rate (to the extent of the affected Loan advances) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request to borrow at the Base Rate if no election is made by Borrowers by the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt of such notice and (2) all amounts from day to day outstanding which are not past due shall bear interest at the Base Rate. 
 9. Successor Rate . Section 2.4 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows 
 2.4 Replacement of Monthly SOFR or Successor Rate . 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or Borrowers or Required Lenders notify Administrative Agent (with, in the case of Required Lenders, a copy to Borrowers) that Borrowers or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that 
 (a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Monthly SOFR, including, without limitation, because one (1) month interest periods of the Term SOFR Screen Rate are not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or 
 (b) the Applicable Authority has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one (1) month interest periods of term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. Dollar-denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide such representative one (1) month interest periods of term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one (1) month interest periods of term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 then, on a date and time determined by Administrative Agent (any such date, the Monthly SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be on an Interest Rate Change Date or on the relevant interest payment date for interest calculated, as applicable, and, solely with respect to clause (b) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Monthly SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate ). 
 If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Monthly SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in clauses (a) or (b) above have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, Administrative Agent and Borrowers may amend this Agreement and the other Loan Documents solely for the purpose of replacing Monthly SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 2.4 on an Interest Rate Change Date or on the relevant interest payment date for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then 
 EXHIBIT A (SOFR) - PAGE 6 

existing convention for similar U.S. Dollar-denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. Dollar-denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. Administrative Agent s Time on the fifth (5 th Business Day after Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and Borrowers unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify Borrowers and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by Administrative Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero percent (0.00 ), the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero percent (0.00 for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to Borrowers and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrowers, Administrative Agent and Lenders at all times to comply with applicable state Law or applicable United States federal Law (to the extent that it permits a Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve, or receive a greater amount of interest than under state Law) and that this Section shall control every other covenant and agreement in this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents. If applicable state or federal Law should at any time be judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for under any of the Loan Documents, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved, or received with respect to the Loan, or if Administrative Agent s exercise of the option to accelerate the Maturity Date, or if any prepayment by Borrowers results in Borrowers having paid any interest in excess of that permitted by Applicable Law, then it is Administrative Agent s and each Lender s express intent that all excess amounts theretofore collected by Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be credited on the Principal Debt and all other Indebtedness and the provisions of the Loan Documents shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new documents, so as to comply with the Applicable Law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder or thereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the use, forbearance, or detention of the Loan shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Rate from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding. Without limitation of the foregoing, if Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the Principal Debt or, if it exceeds such unpaid Principal Debt, refunded to Borrowers. 
 EXHIBIT A (SOFR) - PAGE 7 

10. Compensation for Losses . Section 2.6 of the Loan Agreement is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows 
 2.6 Compensation for Losses . Within ten (10) days of written demand by any Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time (and at the time of any prepayment), Borrowers shall compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it (collectively, Consequential Losses as a result of 
 (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Principal Debt bearing interest at a Monthly SOFR Rate or, if applicable, a Successor Rate on a day other than the last day of the interest period therefor (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, acceleration upon any transfer or conveyance of any right, title or interest in the Property giving Administrative Agent on behalf of Lenders the right to accelerate the maturity of the Loan) 
 (b) any failure by Borrowers (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make an advance at a Monthly SOFR Rate or, if applicable, a Successor Rate) to prepay, continue or convert any Principal Debt bearing interest at a Monthly SOFR Rate or, if applicable, a Successor Rate on the date or in the amount notified by Borrowers in any rollover conversion notice or otherwise or 
 (c) any assignment of Principal Debt bearing interest at a Monthly SOFR Rate or, if applicable, a Successor Rate other than on the last day of the interest period therefor as a result of a request by Borrowers pursuant to Section 9.11 , 
 including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Principal Debt bearing interest at a Monthly SOFR Rate or, if applicable, a Successor Rate or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
 The amounts payable under this Section shall never be less than zero or greater than is permitted by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, no amounts will be owing under this Section in connection with the prepayment of any Base Rate Principal, if applicable, or any Principal Debt bearing interest at a Daily Simple SOFR-related rate (if any). 
 By its signature below, each Borrower waives any right under California Civil Code Section 2954.10 or otherwise to prepay the Loan, in whole or in part, without payment of all amounts specified in this Section. Each Borrower acknowledges that prepayment of the Loan may result in Lenders incurring additional losses, costs, expenses and liabilities, including lost revenues and lost profits. Each Borrower therefore agrees to pay all amounts specified in this Section if any Monthly SOFR Principal is prepaid, whether voluntarily or by reason of acceleration, including acceleration upon any transfer or conveyance of any right, title or interest in the Property or Borrower giving Administrative Agent or Lenders the right to accelerate the maturity of the Loan as provided in the Loan Documents. Each Borrower agrees that Lenders willingness to offer the Monthly SOFR Rate to Borrowers is sufficient and independent consideration, given individual weight by Lenders, for this waiver. Each Borrower understands that Lenders would not offer the Monthly SOFR Rate to Borrowers absent this waiver. 
 Dated as of the date of this Agreement.
