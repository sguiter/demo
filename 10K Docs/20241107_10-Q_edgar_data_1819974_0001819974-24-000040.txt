 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that SkyWater Technology, Inc. SkyWater, the Company, we, us, or our believes to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, words such as may, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, target, seek, potential, believe, will, could, should, would, and project or the negative thereof or variations thereon or similar words or expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Key factors that may affect our results include, among others, the following: 
 our goals and strategies; 
 our future business development, financial condition, and results of operations; 
 our ability to continue operating our fabrication facilities at full capacity; 
 our ability to appropriately respond to changing technologies on a timely and cost-effective basis; 
 our customer relationships and our ability to retain and expand our customer relationships; 
 our ability to accurately predict our future revenues for the purpose of appropriately budgeting and adjusting our expenses; 
 our expectations regarding dependence on our largest customers; 
 our ability to diversify our customer base and develop relationships in new markets; 
 the performance and reliability of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers; 
 our ability to procure tools, materials, and chemicals; 
 our ability to control costs, including our operating and capital expenses; 
 the size and growth potential of the markets for our solutions, and our ability to serve and expand our presence in those markets; 
 the level of demand in our customers end markets; 
 our ability to attract, train, and retain key qualified personnel in a competitive labor market; 
 adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs; 
 changes in trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs; 
 our ability to raise additional capital or financing; 
 our ability to accurately forecast demand; 
 changes in local, regional, national, and international economic or political conditions, including those resulting from rising inflation and interest rates, a recession, or intensified international hostilities; 
 the level and timing of U.S. government program funding; 
 our ability to maintain compliance with certain U.S. government contracting requirements; 
 regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; 
 our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; and 
 other factors disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Moreover, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be affected by new risks that could emerge from time to time. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and outcomes discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events or outcomes. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the results, levels of activity, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. 
 The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views only as of the date hereof. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements to conform such statements to changes in expectations or to actual results, or for any other reason, except as required by law. You should therefore not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date hereof.

 , if necessary, to enable the Company to meet its obligations as they become due. The support letter expires March 18, 2026. Based upon SkyWater s operating forecasts, its cash and cash equivalents on hand, available borrowings on the Revolver, and potential cost reduction measures it could undertake, management believes SkyWater will have sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months from the date these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 Additionally, the Company could seek additional equity or debt financing, including a refinancing and/or expansion of the Revolver, however it cannot provide any assurance that additional funds will be available when needed or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to the Company. The Company s ability to access additional funds depends on prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond SkyWater s control. 
 SkyWater has based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and its operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to it.

 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting. The amendments in this update improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. SkyWater will reflect the amended disclosure requirements of this update in its annual consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ending December 29, 2024 and for the interim periods in its fiscal year ending December 28, 2025. Given that the Company reports as a single reportable segment, the impacts of adopting the provisions of this update will not be significant.

 (the VIE Financing to finance the acquisition of the land and building of the SkyWater Minnesota facility. The VIE Financing is repayable in equal monthly installments of over years, with the remaining balance payable at the maturity date of October 6, 2030. The interest rate under the VIE Financing is fixed at . The VIE Financing is guaranteed by Oxbow Industries, who is also the sole equity holder of Oxbow Realty. The VIE financing is not subject to financial debt default covenants. 
 The terms of the VIE Financing include provisions that grant the lender several protective rights when certain triggering events defined in the loan agreement occur, including events tied to the Company s occupancy of the SkyWater Minnesota facility and SkyWater s financial performance. The triggering events are not financial covenants and the occurrence of a triggering event does not represent a default event, nor does it result in the VIE Financing becoming callable, rather the protective rights become enforceable by the lender. As defined in the loan agreement, a triggering event occurred beginning in the three-month period ended January 1, 2023 based on the level of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, as defined in the loan agreement, reported by SkyWater historically. Pursuant to its protective rights, the lender retained in a restricted account amounts paid by SkyWater to Oxbow Realty that were in excess of the scheduled debt payments paid by Oxbow Realty to the lender. The triggering event was cured during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 and the funds held in the restricted account were remitted back to Oxbow Realty. No triggering events as defined in the loan agreement existed as of September 29, 2024. 
 Tool Financing Loans 
 The Company, from time to time, enters into financing arrangements with equipment lenders to finance the purchase of manufacturing tools and other equipment. These agreements are often structured as sale and leasebacks, to which the leases includes bargain purchase options at the end of the lease terms that the Company intends to exercise. The Company accounts for these transactions as failed sale and leasebacks with the associated tools recorded in property and equipment, net and the proceeds received from equipment lenders recorded as financing obligations on the Company s interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. Prior to placing a tool into service, advanced payments received from equipment lenders are recorded as short-term financings on the Company s interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. When the financed tools are placed into service, financing agreements are executed to repay the equipment lenders the outstanding financial obligations over a period of time. Upon execution of the financing arrangements, the financing obligation is classified as long-term debt. Advance payments of tools that have been financed by equipment lenders prior to placing the underlying tool into service totaled and as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 For purposes of this section, the terms we, us, our, and SkyWater refer to SkyWater Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a U.S.-based, independent, pure-play technology foundry that offers advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing services from our fabrication facility, or fab, in Minnesota and advanced packaging services from our Florida facility. Our Technology-as-a-Service model leverages a foundation of proprietary technology, engineering know-how capabilities, and microelectronics manufacturing capacity to co-develop process technology intellectual property IP with our customers that enables disruptive concepts through our Advanced Technology Services ATS for diverse microelectronics (integrated circuits ICs )) and related micro- and nanotechnology applications. In addition to differentiated technology development services, we support customers with volume production of ICs for high-growth markets through our Wafer Services. 
 The combination of semiconductor development and manufacturing services we provide our customers is not available to them from a conventional fab. In addition, we believe our status as a publicly-traded, U.S.-based, U.S. headquartered pure-play technology foundry with Defense Microelectronics Activity Category 1A Trusted Accreditation from the U.S. Department of Defense positions us well to provide distinct, competitive advantages to our customers. These advantages include the benefits of enhanced IP security and secure access to a U.S. domestic supply chain. 
 We primarily focus on serving diversified, high-growth end users in numerous vertical markets, including (1) advanced compute, (2) aerospace and defense, (3) automotive, (4) bio-health, and (5) industrial. By housing both development and manufacturing in a single operation, we rapidly and efficiently transition newly-developed processes to high-yielding volume production, eliminating the time it would otherwise take to transfer production to a third-party fab. Through our ATS model, we specialize in co-creating advanced solutions with our customers that directly serve our end markets, such as infrared imaging, superconducting ICs for quantum computing and sensing, Rad-hard complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS ), integrated photonics, microelectromechanical systems MEMS ), technologies for biomedical and imaging applications, and advanced packaging. Our Wafer Services include the manufacture of silicon-based analog and mixed-signal ICs for our end markets. Our focus on the differentiated analog and CMOS markets supports long product life-cycles and requirements that value performance over cost-efficiencies, and leverages our portfolio IP. 
 Before we began independent operations, our Minnesota fab was owned and operated by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation Cypress as a captive manufacturing facility for 26 years. We have leveraged Cypress systems, manufacturing technology, and process development capabilities to advance our product offerings. We became an independent company in 2017 when we were acquired by an affiliate of Oxbow Industries, LLC Oxbow Industries as part of a divestiture from Cypress. Our multi-year foundry services agreement with Cypress, which ended in 2020, created a runway for us to operate the foundry at a high utilization rate while continuing to expand and diversify the customer base transferred by Cypress. Cypress was acquired in 2020 by Infineon Technologies AG.

 Factors and Trends Affecting our Business and Results of Operations 
 The following trends and uncertainties either affected our financial performance during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 or are reasonably likely to impact our results in the future. 
 Macroeconomic and competitive conditions, including cyclicality and consolidation, as well as government funding in semiconductor technology and manufacturing, create unique challenges and opportunities for the semiconductor industry and SkyWater. 
 In August 2022, the U.S. enacted the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the CHIPS Act pursuant to which the United States has committed to a renewed focus on providing incentives and funding for onshore companies to develop and advance the latest semiconductor technologies, supporting onshore manufacturing capabilities, and on strengthening key onshore supply chains. The CHIPS Act authorizes the U.S. Department of Commerce to enable execution of awards under the CHIPS Act and provides 52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development, including 39 billion in financial assistance to build, expand, or modernize domestic facilities and equipment for semiconductor fabrication, assembly, testing, advanced packaging, or research and development. In December 2023, we submitted an application to the CHIPS Program Office of the U.S. Department of Commerce for funding through the CHIPS and Science Act for modernization and equipment upgrades to enhance production at our Minnesota facility. 
 Additionally, the CHIPS Act provides incentives to semiconductor chip manufacturers in the U.S., including providing a 25 manufacturing investment credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing property placed in service after December 31, 2022, for which construction begins before January 1, 2027. Property investments qualify for the 25 credit if, among other requirements, the property is integral to the operation of an advanced manufacturing facility, defined as having a primary purpose of manufacturing semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In October 2024, we received a registration number from the Internal Revenue Service that enabled us to claim 1,624 of refundable manufacturing investment credits on our federal tax return for the 2023 tax year. 
 We project customer-funded capital investment to be a significant driver of the success of our business model, as we expect customers to invest in our capabilities and enable us to develop technology platforms that will drive our future growth. 
 Our overall level of indebtedness from our revolving credit agreement, which we refer to as the Revolver (as defined below and in Note 6 Debt of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing), financing arising from the sale and leaseback of the land and building of our Minnesota facility, which we refer to as the VIE Financing, financing arrangements with equipment lenders to finance the purchase of manufacturing tools and other equipment, which we refer to as the tool financing loans, and the corresponding interest rates charged to us by our lenders, are key components of maintaining capital funding that allow us to continue to grow our business. 
 
 Financial Performance Metrics 
 Our senior management team regularly reviews certain key financial performance metrics within our business, including: 
 Revenue, gross profit, and gross margin; and 
 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue, which are financial measures not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results, as well as items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry.

 Revenue 
 Revenue was 93.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 71.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 22.2 million, or 31 . Revenue was 266.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 207.5 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 59.3 million, or 29 . The increases in revenue were driven by increases in ATS development revenue and tools revenue, partially offset by a decrease in wafer services revenue. 
 The following table shows revenue by service type for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 and 2023: 
 Third Quarter Ended First Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 (in thousands) ATS development 56,390 53,891 179,244 153,735 Wafer Services 6,718 14,490 22,490 49,079 Combined ATS development and Wafer Services

 ATS development revenue increased 2.5 million, or 5 , from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. Continued momentum in U.S. government programs to bolster the domestic semiconductor supply chain and strengthen the defense industrial base drove an increase in revenue of 6.1 million. This increase was partially offset by decreases of 1.5 million, 1.2 million and 0.7 million in the consumer, cloud computing, and bio-health end-markets, respectively due to cyclicality of the stages of our customers development programs. 
 ATS development revenue increased 25.5 million, or 17 , from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024. Continued momentum in U.S. government programs to bolster the domestic semiconductor supply chain and strengthen the defense industrial base drove an increase in revenue of 37.0 million. This increase was partially offset by decreases of 5.5 million, 4.8 million, and 1.6 million in the consumer, cloud computing, and bio-health end-markets, respectively, due to cyclicality of the stages of our customers development programs. 
 Tools revenue increased 27.5 million from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024, and increased 60.3 million from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024, driven by increased investment by our customers to acquire tools that advance our capabilities for their ATS development programs. 
 The decreases in Wafer Services revenue of 7.8 million, or 54 , from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 and 26.6 million, or 54 , from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024 were primarily driven by decreased activity within the automotive end-markets as a result of higher inventory levels and softening demand in our automotive customers end markets. 
 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue increased 16.1 million to 73.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 57.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 27.6 million increase in the cost of tools revenue arising from increased tools revenue as we procure tools on behalf of our customers to advance our capabilities for their ATS development programs and a 3.7 million increase in costs related to facility expansion and other services provided to our customers as their programs grow. Partially offsetting these increases are; the benefit from the reversal of a 5.6 million program loss accrual initially recognized in the first quarter of 2024 arising from a contract modification with our customer that reduced the estimated costs of completing their program and reestablished the program to profitability; a 0.8 million decrease in labor costs primarily due to lower variable compensation expense; a 2.9 million decrease in depreciation expense as depreciation of stepped up fair values on the assets acquired from Cypress in 2017 were fully depreciated in the first quarter of 2024; a 2.5 million decrease in our fab operating costs; a 0.7 million decrease in royalty expense due to more favorable royalty rates following a contract re-negotiation; and a 0.5 million decrease in bad debt expense due to improved collections. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, cost of revenue increased 56.2 million to 216.5 million from 160.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 60.0 million increase in the cost of tools revenue arising from increased tools revenue as we procure tools on behalf of our customers to advance our capabilities for their ATS development programs and an additional cost of 15.6 million related to facility expansion and other services provided to our customers as their programs grow. Partially offsetting these increases were: a 2.7 million decrease in labor costs primarily due to lower variable compensation expense; an 8.3 million decrease in depreciation expense as depreciation of stepped up fair values on the assets acquired from Cypress in 2017 were fully depreciated in the first quarter of 2024; a 2.5 million decrease in

 our fab operating costs; a 1.7 million decrease in royalty expense due to more favorable royalty rates following a contract re-negotiation; and a 3.9 million decrease in bad debt expense due to improved collections. 
 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense increased 1.2 million to 3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 2.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, research and development expense increased 3.5 million to 10.8 million from 7.3 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increases were primarily attributable to increased RH90 and S90 platform development efforts. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 4.0 million to 12.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, from 16.1 million for the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to a 4.1 million decrease in external management and operations consulting services as a result of completing the service engagements in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a 1.2 million reduction in bad debt expense due to improved collections on aged invoices. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, selling, general and administrative expense decreased 13.2 million to 35.6 million from 48.8 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to a 4.2 million decrease in external management and operations consulting services as a result of completing the service engagements in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a 3.2 million reduction in bad debt expense due to improved collections on aged invoices. 
 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense decreased 0.5 million to 2.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 2.5 million for the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to decreased amounts outstanding under the Revolver in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, interest expense decreased 1 million to 6.9 million from 7.9 million for the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to decreased amounts outstanding under the Revolver in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Income tax (benefit) expense 
 Income tax expense was 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 0.1 million benefit for the third quarter of 2023. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.4 , compared to an effective income tax rate of 1.4 for the third quarter of 2023. Income tax benefit was 0.0 million for the first nine months of 2024 which remained flat with the first nine months of 2023. The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was (0.2) , compared to an effective income tax rate of 0.4 for the first nine months of 2023. Our effective tax rates for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 and for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 differ from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to application of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based on our assessment of our ability to utilize those deferred tax assets in future periods. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased to 1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 from 1.0 million for the third quarter of 2023, and decreased to 3.2 million for the first nine months of 2024 from 3.7 million for the first nine months of 2023. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the net income of Oxbow Realty, LLC Oxbow Realty ), the variable interest entity VIE ), that we consolidate and represents the economic interest in the profits and losses of the VIE that our common stock shareholders do not legally have rights or obligations to. The respective increase and decreases in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 primarily relates to timing differences in the recognition of interest income from the intercompany lease arrangement with Oxbow Realty and when rent increases were effective as described in Note 11 - Related Party Transactions of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing.

 Our ability to execute our operating strategy is dependent on our ability to maintain liquidity and continue to access capital through our Revolver (as defined in Note 6 Debt of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing) and other sources of financing. We have identified specific actions that we could take to reduce operating costs and improve cash flows, including reductions in spending and delays in hiring personnel. If such actions are taken, it may require us to decrease our level of planned investment in new products and technologies, or discontinue further expansion of our business. We have also obtained a support letter from Oxbow Industries, an affiliate of our principal stockholder, to provide funding in an amount up to 12.5 million, if necessary, to enable us to meet our obligations as they become due. The support letter expires March 18, 2026. Based upon our operational forecasts, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our available borrowings on the Revolver, and potential cost reduction measures we could take, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the date the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 Additionally, we could seek additional equity or debt financing, including a refinancing and/or expansion of the Revolver. However, we cannot provide any assurance that additional funds will be available when needed, or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to access additional funds depend on prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. 
 We had 20.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, not including cash held by a VIE that we consolidate, and availability under our Revolver of 75.6 million at September 29, 2024. We are subject to certain liquidity and EBITDA covenants under our Loan Agreement, as outlined in the section below entitled Indebtedness. 
 ATM Program 
 For the first nine months of 2024, SkyWater did not sell shares under the ATM Program (as defined in Note 8 Shareholders Equity of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing). From the date of the ATM Program through the third quarter of 2024, the Company has cumulatively sold 2.5 million shares under the ATM Program at an average sale price of 9.96 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately 25.1 million before deducting sales commissions and fees of approximately 1.2 million. SkyWater used the net proceeds to pay down the Revolver and fund its operations. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we spent approximately 15.8 million and 4.5 million, respectively, on capital expenditures, including purchases of property, equipment and software. The majority of these capital expenditures relate to improvements at our Minnesota facility and the development of our advanced packaging capabilities at our Center for NeoVation in Florida, as well as 6.7 million of capital expenditures undertaken by Oxbow Realty, our consolidated VIE. We anticipate our cash on hand and the availability under the Revolver will provide the funds needed to meet our customer demand and anticipated capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. 
 We have approximately 7.5 million of contractual commitments relating to various anticipated capital expenditures outstanding at September 29, 2024 that we expect to pay during the remainder of 2024 through cash on hand and operating cash flows.

 Working Capital 
 Historically, we have depended on cash on hand, funds available under our Revolver and proceeds of equity security offerings to fund our operations. In the future, we may need to depend on additional debt and equity financings to fund our growth strategy, working capital needs, and capital expenditures. We believe that these sources of funds will be adequate to provide cash, as required, to support our strategy, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations, and working capital for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain future debt or equity financings on commercially reasonable terms sufficient to meet our cash requirements. 
 At September 29, 2024, the outstanding balance of our Revolver was 21.3 million, and our remaining availability under the Revolver was 75.6 million. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with applicable financial covenants of the Revolver and expect to be in compliance with applicable financial covenants over the next twelve months. 
 The following table sets forth general information derived from our interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023: 
 First Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 19,739 (21,662) Net cash used in investing activities (15,792) (4,476) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 (1,645) 13,459 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 At September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 20.7 million and 18.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, respectively. A discussion of the change in cash and cash equivalents can be found below. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flow from operations is driven by changes in the working capital needs associated with the various goods and services we provide, and expenses related to the infrastructure in place to support revenue generation. Working capital is primarily affected by changes in accounts receivable, contract assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and contract liabilities, all of which are partially correlated to, and impacted by, changes in the timing and volume of activities performed in our facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 19.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 41.4 million from the 21.7 million of cash used in operating activities during the first nine months of 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2024 was driven by: a 28.7 million increase in the change in accounts receivable and contract assets during the period due to improved cash collection efforts as a result of a higher quality customer mix and timing on invoicing for unbilled work; a 15.0 million increase in the change in contract liabilities during the period due to the timing of receipt of customer payments and completion of performance obligations, notably with respect to tools; a 13.7 million improvement in operating results during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023; and a 4.2 million increase in the change in inventories during the period as our spare parts inventory was greater utilized and consumed. This increase was partially offset by: a 10.6 million decrease in the change in accrued expenses and accounts payable during the period due to the timing of the payment of amounts owed to our vendors and large accruals for consulting services and accrued compensation in the prior year; a 8.4 million decrease in depreciation expense during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 as depreciation of stepped up fair values on the assets acquired from Cypress in 2017 were fully depreciated in the first quarter of 2024; and a 3.9 million decrease in bad debt expense during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 as collections improved. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investments in capital expenditures are intended to enable revenue growth in new and expanding markets, help us meet product demand, and increase our manufacturing efficiencies and capacity. Net cash used in investing activities was 15.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4.5 million during the first nine months of 2023 as we continue to invest in our development and manufacturing capabilities. Net cash used in investing activities increased 11.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to increases of 10.0 million and 1.3 million in purchase of property and equipment and purchases of software and technology licenses, respectively. Increases in purchases of property and equipment were driven by investments made by Oxbow Realty, our consolidated VIE, of 6.7 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to no such investments during the first nine months of 2023. Customers continue to invest heavily in our development and production capabilities, which reduces the amount of future capital investment required to achieve our growth plans.

 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities decreased 15.1 million during the first nine months of 2024 to 1.6 million of net cash used in financing activities from 13.5 million of net cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in cash flows from financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by: a 20.4 million decrease in proceeds from our ATM program as we have not issued common stock under the ATM program in 2024; 6.1 million fewer tool financing proceeds received in the first nine months of 2024 due to fewer tools being financed; and a 1.4 million increase in principal payments on long-term debt. These decreases are offset by: a 11.2 million decrease in net repayments on our Revolver; and 1.4 million increase in net contributions from noncontrolling interest to fund capital expenditures made by Oxbow Realty.

 Indebtedness 
 Sale Leaseback Transaction 
 In 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell the land and building of our Minnesota facility to Oxbow Realty, an affiliate of our principal stockholder, for 39.0 million, less applicable transaction costs of 1.5 million and transaction services fees paid to Oxbow Realty of 2.0 million, and paid a guarantee fee to our principal stockholder of 2.0 million. We subsequently entered into an agreement to leaseback the land and building from Oxbow Realty for initial payments of 0.4 million per month over 20 years. The monthly payments are subject to a 2 increase each year during the term of the lease. We are also required to make certain customary payments constituting additional rent, including certain monthly reserve, insurance, and tax payments, in accordance with the terms of the lease. Due to our continuing involvement in the property, we are accounting for the transactions as a failed sale and leaseback. Under failed sale and leaseback accounting, we are deemed the owner of the land and building with the proceeds received recorded as a financial obligation. As Oxbow Realty is a VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary (as described in Note 12 - Variable Interest Entity of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing), we consolidate the balances and results of Oxbow Realty in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements; accordingly, the impacts of this transaction are eliminated in consolidation. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On December 28, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement with Siena Lending Group LLC Siena ). The Loan Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of up to 100.0 million with a scheduled maturity date of December 28, 2025 (the Revolver ). The Company incurred 4.3 million of debt issuance costs, which will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Revolver. Borrowing under the Loan Agreement is limited by a borrowing base of specified advance rates applicable to billed accounts receivable, contract assets, inventory and equipment, subject to various conditions and limits as provided in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement also provides for borrowing base sublimits applicable to each of contract assets and equipment. Under certain circumstances, Siena may from time to time establish and revise reserves against the borrowing base and/or the maximum revolving facility amount. As of September 29, 2024, the borrowing base of 96.9 million was below the 100.0 million borrowing limit and, our outstanding borrowings of 21.3 million resulted in remaining availability under the Revolver of 75.6 million 
 Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at a rate that depends upon the type of borrowing, whether a term secured overnight financing rate SOFR loan or base rate loan, plus the applicable margin. The term SOFR loan rate is a forward-looking term rate based on SOFR for a tenor of one month on the applicable day, subject to a minimum of 2.5 per annum. The base rate is the greatest of the prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 0.5 and 7.0 per annum. The applicable margin is an applicable percentage based on the fix charged coverage ratio that ranges from 5.25 to 6.25 per annum for term SOFR loans and ranges from 4.25 to 5.25 per annum for base rate loans. 
 The Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and financial and other covenants and conditions. Subject to certain cure rights, the Loan Agreement requires 10.0 million in minimum EBITDA (as defined in the Loan Agreement) calculated as of the last day of each calendar month commencing April 30, 2023 for the preceding twelve calendar months, prohibits unfunded capital expenditures in excess of 15.0 million calculated as of the last day of each calendar month commencing April 30, 2023 for the preceding twelve calendar months, and requires a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, measured on a trailing twelve month basis, of not less than 1.00 to 1.00 if our liquidity is less than 15.0 million. In addition, the Loan Agreement places certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness (other than permitted indebtedness), to create liens or other encumbrances (other than liens relating to permitted indebtedness), to sell or otherwise dispose of assets, to merge or consolidate with other entities, and to make certain restricted payments, including payments of dividends to our stockholders. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants of the Loan Agreement and expect to continue to be in compliance with applicable financial covenants over the next twelve months. 
 Due to a lockbox clause in the Loan Agreement, the outstanding loan balance is required to be serviced with working capital, and the debt is classified as short-term on the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Tool Financing Loans 
 We, from time to time, enter into financing arrangements with equipment lenders to purchase manufacturing tools and other equipment. These agreements are often structured as sale and leasebacks, to which the leases includes bargain purchase options at the end of the lease terms that we intend to exercise. We account for these transactions as failed sale and leasebacks with the associated tools recorded in property and equipment, net and the proceeds received from equipment lenders recorded as financing obligations on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. Prior to placing a tool into service, advanced payments received from equipment lenders are recorded as short-term financings on our interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. When the financed tools are placed into service, financing agreements are executed to repay the equipment lenders the outstanding financial obligations over a period of time. Upon execution of the financing arrangements, the financing obligation is classified as long-term debt. Advance payments received from equipment lenders were zero and 3.8 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no significant changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Material Cash Requirements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We qualify as an emerging growth company pursuant to the provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act ). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory say-on-pay votes on executive compensation, and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. 
 The JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards on a non-delayed basis. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 In connection with preparing our interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes are relevant at the time we prepared our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates. 
 On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, valuation of inventory, equity-based compensation, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 Our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To supplement our interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, additional non-GAAP financial measures are provided and reconciled in the table below. 
 We provide supplemental non-GAAP financial information that our management regularly evaluates to provide additional insight to investors as supplemental information to our U.S. GAAP results. Our management uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to make informed operating decisions, complete strategic planning, prepare annual budgets, and evaluate Company and management performance. We believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure to our investors because it provides a baseline for analyzing trends in our business and excludes certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The use of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the comparable U.S. GAAP measure. In addition, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, other companies, including our peers, may calculate their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do. As a result, the non-GAAP financial measure presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance, including net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, business transformation costs, management transition expense, the cost of severance, separation and other termination benefits, and the cost of CHIPS Act specialist fees. 
 We believe adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure to our investors because it allows for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to other companies, including our peers, without regard to financing methods or capital structures. We exclude the items listed above from net income or loss in arriving at adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially within our industry depending on the accounting methods and policies used, book values of assets, capital structures, and the methods by which assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net (loss) income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance, such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, unless otherwise expressly indicated.

 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA, our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 (5) Represents net income attributable to noncontrolling interests arising from our VIE, which was formed for the purpose of purchasing the land and building of our operating facility in Bloomington, Minnesota. Since interest expense is added back to net income (loss) to shareholders in our adjusted EBITDA financial measure, we also add back the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as its net income is derived from interest the VIE charges SkyWater.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Currently, our market risks relate to potential changes in the fair value of our debt due to fluctuations in applicable market interest rates. In the future, our market risk exposure generally will be limited to those risks that arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative, non-operating transactions, nor do we utilize financial instruments or derivative instruments for trading purposes. 
 Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and contract assets. Cash balances are maintained at financial institutions, which at times exceed federally insured limits. We monitor the financial condition of the financial institutions in which our accounts are maintained and have not experienced any losses in such accounts. We perform ongoing credit evaluations as to the financial condition of our customers with respect to trade receivables and contract assets. Generally, no collateral is required as a condition of sale. Our consideration of the need for an allowance for credit losses is based upon current market conditions and other factors. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 At September 29, 2024, the outstanding balance of our Revolver, which bears interest at a variable rate, was 21.3 million. At September 29, 2024, the rate in effect was 10.6 . Based on the outstanding balance of our Revolver at September 29, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by 0.2 million annually.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer) as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 29, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 29, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 In light of this fact, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, has concluded that our interim condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related interim condensed consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in conformity with GAAP. 
 Previously Reported Material Weaknesses 
 As disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Controls Activity component of the COSO Framework and our revenue accounting process, which were not remediated as of September 29, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Remediation Plans 
 As disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, actions were undertaken in fiscal year 2023 to implement new controls and enhance existing controls to remediate the material weaknesses in the Control Activities component of the COSO Framework and our revenue accounting process. These actions were completed on a timeframe that did not demonstrate sustained execution of those controls throughout fiscal year 2023. Remediation of the Control Activities component of the COSO Framework and our revenue accounting process material weaknesses will require further validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of time in fiscal year 2024. To remediate these material weaknesses, management plans to sustain the execution of the process-level and information technology controls implemented or enhanced in fiscal year 2023 throughout fiscal year 2024. We will not be able to conclude whether the actions we are taking will remediate these material weaknesses until we have completed our remediation plans and perform testing to validate the effectiveness of these controls. 
 As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses in the Control Activities components of the COSO Framework and our revenue accounting process, we may determine that additional measures or time are required to address the control deficiencies or that we need to modify or otherwise adjust the remediation actions described above. The material weaknesses in the Control Activities component of the COSO Framework and our revenue accounting process cannot be considered remediated until the controls we implemented or enhanced in fiscal year 2023 have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
