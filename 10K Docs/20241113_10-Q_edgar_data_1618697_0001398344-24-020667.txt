FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, or this Report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of Part I of this Report, contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as may, 
 should, plan, anticipate, estimate, intend, predict, 
 believe, expect, will, will be, and project or the negative of these
terms or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based
upon reasonable assumptions, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Some factors
that might cause such a difference include the following: increased direct competition; changes in government regulations or accounting
rules; changes in local, national and global economic and capital market conditions; our ability to obtain or maintain credit lines or
credit facilities on satisfactory terms; changes in interest rates; availability of proceeds from our private offering of common shares;
our ability to identify suitable investments and/or to close on identified investments; the performance of our investments; and the ability
of borrowers related to our debt investments to make payments under their respective loans. Our actual results could differ materially
from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason. You should exercise caution in relying on forward-looking
statements as they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may materially affect our future results, performance,
achievements or transactions. Information on factors which could impact actual results and cause them to differ from what is anticipated
in the forward-looking statements contained herein is included in this Report as well as in our other filings with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission SEC ), including but not limited to those described in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report and in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that was
filed on March 22, 2024. Moreover, because we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, new risks are likely to
emerge from time to time. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements as a prediction of future results, which apply only as of the date of this Report, unless noted otherwise. Except as may be
required by federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not undertake to revise or update any forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risk factors identified in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report and in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023,
that was filed on March 22, 2024. The forward-looking statements and projections contained in this Report are excluded from the safe harbor
protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. 

All references to Note 
or Notes throughout this Report refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the registrant in Part I. Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). 

Unless otherwise noted, the
terms we, us, our, and the Master Fund refer to Guggenheim Credit Income Fund.

GUGGENHEIM CREDIT INCOME FUND 

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 (in thousands, except share and per share
data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; 

 for example, with the word million 
or otherwise) 

million were held in a U.S. Bank money market deposit account. As of December 31, 2023, the Master Fund s cash equivalents
of million were held in a U.S. Bank money market deposit account. The U.S. Bank money market deposit account is considered a Level
1 security within the fair value hierarchy. Cash and cash equivalents, at times, may exceed federal insured limits. 

Investments for which market
quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers
or market makers. With respect to the Master Fund s portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available,
the Master Fund s board of trustees Board of Trustees ), including our trustees who are not interested persons 
as defined in the 1940 Act (the Independent Trustees ), is responsible for determining in good faith the fair value of the
Master Fund s portfolio investments in accordance with the valuation policy and procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. Pursuant
to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act Rule 2a-5 ), the Board of Trustees has designated the Advisor as the valuation designee
to perform fair valuation determinations for the Master Fund with respect to all Fund investments and/or other assets. The Advisor conducts
a fair value determination process on a quarterly basis and any other time when a decision regarding the fair value of the portfolio investments
is required. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC adopted Rule 2a-5 which establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith and became
effective September 8, 2022. Rule 2a-5 also defines when readily available market quotations for purposes of the 1940 Act
and establishes requirements for determining whether a fund must fair value a security in good faith. 

The valuation techniques used
by the Master Fund for the assets that are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy are described below. 

Senior Debt and Subordinated Debt: Senior
debt and subordinated debt investments are valued at initial transaction price and are subsequently valued using (i) market data
for similar instruments (e.g., recent transactions or indicative broker quotes), and/or (ii) valuation models. Valuation models
may be based on investment yield analysis and discounted cash flow techniques, where the key inputs include risk-adjusted discount rates
and required rates of return, based on the analysis of similar debt investments issued by similar issuers. 

Equity/Other Investments: Equity/other
investments are valued at initial transaction price and are subsequently valued using valuation models in the absence of readily observable
market prices. Valuation models are generally based on (i) market and income (discounted cash flow) approaches, in which various internal
and external factors are considered, and (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiples
analysis. Factors include key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions for comparable investments. Key inputs used
for the discounted cash flow approach include the weighted average cost of capital and investment terminal values derived from EBITDA
multiples. An illiquidity discount may be applied where appropriate. 

The Master Fund utilizes several
valuation techniques that use unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of its Level 3 investments. The
valuation techniques, as well as the key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on the Master Fund s investments classified
and valued as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy, are described in Note 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments .
The unobservable inputs and assumptions may differ by asset and in the application of the Master Fund s valuation methodologies.
The reported fair value estimates could vary materially if the Master Fund had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs
and assumptions. 

The determination of fair
value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments
that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of investments may differ materially from the values that would have
been determined had a readily available market value existed for such investments. Further, such investments are generally less liquid
than publicly traded securities. If the Master Fund was required to liquidate a portfolio investment that does not have a readily available
market value in a forced or liquidation sale, the Master Fund could realize significantly less value than the value recorded by the Master
Fund. 

of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections)
for the calendar year, (ii) of its capital gain net income i.e. , capital gains in excess of capital losses), adjusted
for certain ordinary losses, for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 st of the calendar year and (iii) any
net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and
on which the Master Fund paid no federal income tax. The Master Fund may, at its discretion, pay a nondeductible federal excise tax
on under-distribution of taxable ordinary income and capital gains. 

The Master Fund follows ASC
740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured,
presented and disclosed in the financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained
by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or
expense in the current year. Penalties or interest, if applicable, that may be assessed relating to income taxes would be classified as
other expenses in the statements of operations. Management has reviewed all open tax years and concluded that there is no effect to the
Master Funds financial positions or results of operations and no tax liability was required to be recorded resulting from unrecognized
tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. During this period, the Master Fund
did not incur any material interest or penalties. Open tax years are those years that are open for examination by the relevant income
taxing authority. As of September 30, 2024, open U.S. Federal and state income tax years include the tax years ended December 31,
2021 through December 31, 2023. The Master Fund has no examinations in progress. Management s determinations regarding ASC 740 may
be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws,
regulations and interpretations thereof.

For derivatives traded under
an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement ISDA Master Agreement ), the collateral requirements are
typically calculated by netting the mark-to-market amount for each transaction under such agreement and comparing that amount to the value
of any collateral currently pledged by the Master Fund and/or the counterparty. Cash collateral that has been pledged, if any, to cover
obligations of the Master Fund and cash collateral received from the counterparty, if any, is reported on the consolidated statements
of assets and liabilities as collateral deposits (received) for foreign currency forward contracts. Generally, the amount of collateral
due from or to a party has to exceed a minimum transfer amount threshold before a transfer is required. To the extent amounts due to the
Master Fund from a counterparty are not fully collateralized, the Master Fund bears the risk of loss from counterparty non-performance.

based on the simple average of the Master Fund s gross assets at the end of the two most
recently completed calendar months and it is payable in arrears. 

Performance-based Incentive Fee: The
performance-based incentive fee consists of two parts: (i) an incentive fee on income and (ii) an incentive fee on capital gains. 

(i) The incentive fee on income is paid quarterly, if earned; it is computed as the sum of (A) of
quarterly pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of of average adjusted capital up to a limit of of average adjusted
capital, and (B) of pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of of average adjusted capital. 

(ii) The incentive fee on capital gains is paid annually, if earned; it is equal to 20 of realized capital
gains on a cumulative basis from inception, net of (A) all realized capital losses and unrealized depreciation on a cumulative basis from
inception, and (B) the aggregate amount, if any, of previously paid incentive fees on capital gains. 

All fees are computed in accordance
with a detailed fee calculation methodology as approved by the Board of Trustees. 

The Investment Advisory Agreement
may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty: (i) by the Master Fund upon 60 days written notice to Guggenheim,
or (ii) by Guggenheim upon not less than 120 days written notice to the Master Fund. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement
is terminated by Guggenheim, and if the Independent Trustees elect to continue the Master Fund, then Guggenheim shall pay all direct expenses
incurred by the Master Fund as a result of Guggenheim s withdrawal, up to, but not exceeding 250,000. Unless earlier terminated, the
Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date on which the Master Fund s shareholders approved
the Investment Advisory Agreement and will remain in effect year to year thereafter if approved annually (i) by a majority of the Master
Fund s Independent Trustees and (ii) the Master Fund s Board of Trustees or the holders of a majority of the Master Fund s outstanding
voting securities. 

Administrative Services Agreement 

The Master Fund entered into an
administrative services agreement with Guggenheim (the Administrative Services Agreement whereby Guggenheim agreed to provide
administrative services to the Master Fund, including office facilities and equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services.
More specifically, Guggenheim, serving as the administrator (the Administrator ), performs and oversees the Master Fund s required
administrative services, which included financial and corporate record-keeping, preparing and disseminating the Master Fund s reports
to its shareholders and filing reports with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists in determining net asset value, overseeing
the preparation and filing of tax returns, overseeing the payment of expenses and distributions and overseeing the performance of administrative
and professional services fees rendered by others. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Master Fund reimburses
the Administrator for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations
under the Administrative Services Agreement. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Master Fund may
pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis, without incremental profit to the Administrator. 

The Administrative Services Agreement
may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty: (i) by the Master Fund upon 60 days written notice to the Administrator
upon the vote of the Master Fund s Independent Trustees, or (ii) by the Administrator upon not less than 120 days written notice to the
Master Fund. Unless earlier terminated, the Administrative Services Agreement will remain in effect for two years, and thereafter shall
continue automatically for successive one-year periods if approved annually by a majority of the Board of Trustees and the Master Fund s
Independent Trustees. 

Dealer Manager Agreement 

The Master fund is party to a
dealer manager agreement, as amended (the Dealer Manager Agreement with Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC GFD an affiliate of Guggenheim. Under the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement, GFD is to act on a best efforts basis as the exclusive dealer
manager for (i) GCIF 2016T s and GCIF 2019 s public offerings of common shares and (ii) the public offering of common shares for future
feeder funds affiliated with the Master Fund. The Master Fund is not responsible for the compensation of GFD pursuant to the terms of
the Dealer Manager Agreement; therefore, fees compensating GFD are not presented in this periodic report. As to a Feeder Fund, the Deal
Manager Agreement may be terminated by a Feeder Fund or GFD upon 60 calendar days written notice to the other party. 

Capital Structuring Fees and Administrative
Agency Fees 

Guggenheim and its affiliates
are obligated to remit to the Master Fund any earned capital structuring fees and administrative agency fees i.e. loan administration
fees) based on the Master Fund s pro rata portion of the co-investment transactions or originated investments in which the Master
Fund participates.

Co-Investment Transactions Exemptive Relief 

The Master Fund was granted an
SEC exemptive order which grants the Master Fund exemptive relief permitting the Master Fund, subject to the satisfaction of specific
conditions and requirements, to co-invest in privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of Guggenheim. 

Indemnification 

The Investment Advisory Agreement
and Administrative Services Agreement provide certain indemnifications to Guggenheim, its directors, officers, persons associated with
Guggenheim and its affiliates, including the administrator. In addition, the Master Fund s Declaration of Trust, as amended, provides
certain indemnifications to its officers, trustees, agents and certain other persons. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, management believes that the risk of incurring any losses for such indemnifications is remote.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

(amounts in thousands, except share and per share
data, percentages and as otherwise indicated; for example, with the word million or otherwise) 

The information contained in this
Item 2 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this
Report. Capitalized terms used in this Item 2 have the same meaning as in the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented
in Part I. Item 1. Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) , unless otherwise defined herein. 

Overview 

We are a specialty finance investment
company focused on lending to middle market companies. We were formed on September 5, 2014 as a statutory trust under the laws of
the State of Delaware and commenced investment operations on April 2, 2015. In addition, we have elected to be treated as a business development
company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). We are externally managed by
Guggenheim, which is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting due diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment
opportunities, structuring investments, determining the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell, and monitoring
our portfolio on an ongoing basis. 

We serve as the master fund in
a master/feeder fund structure in that one or more feeder funds (each, a Feeder Fund ), each a separate closed-end management
investment company that has adopted our investment objectives and strategies, invests substantially all of its equity capital in our common
shares Shares or Common Shares ). Presently, our shareholders are the two initial shareholders and two Feeder
Funds. 

Beginning with the taxable year
ended December 31, 2015, we have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). 

Plan of Liquidation 

In accordance with the offering
documents and the intention of Guggenheim Credit Income Fund 2016 T GCIF 2016T and Guggenheim Credit Income Fund 2019 GCIF
2019 (together, the Feeder Funds to provide substantial shareholder liquidity, the Boards of Trustees of the Master
Fund and the Feeder Funds approved respective Plans of Liquidation for each company on March 30, 2021 (each, a Liquidation Plan ).
In accordance with the Liquidation Plans, the Board has declared multiple liquidating distributions which are outlined in the table below.
These distributions have been substantially composed of return of capital and have decreased the net asset value of the Master Fund and
Feeder Funds. As such, the value on shareholder s investment statements has decreased as liquidating distributions have been paid. 

For the Master Fund, as of November 13,
2024, over 99 of the NAV has been declared to be paid to shareholders in the form of liquidating distributions.

Investment Objectives and Investment Strategy 

Our investment objectives are
to provide our shareholders with current income, capital preservation, and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. There
can be no assurances that any of these investment objectives will be achieved. 

Prior to the Board s approval
of the Liquidation Plan, our investment strategy was continuously focused on growing an investment portfolio that generates superior risk
adjusted returns by carefully selecting investments through rigorous due diligence and actively managing and monitoring our investment
portfolio. When evaluating an investment and the related portfolio company, we use the resources of Guggenheim to develop an investment
thesis and a proprietary view of a potential portfolio company s intrinsic value and its expected risks and rewards. 

We primarily focused on the following
investment types that may be available within the capital structure of portfolio companies: 

Senior Debt. Senior debt investments generally take a security interest in the available assets
of the portfolio company, including equity interests in any of its subsidiaries. The senior debt classification includes senior secured
first lien loans, senior secured second lien loans, senior secured bonds, and senior unsecured debt. In some circumstances, the secured
lien could be subordinated to the claims of other creditors. While there is no specific collateral associated with senior unsecured debt,
such positions are senior in payment priority over subordinated debt investments. 

Subordinated Debt. Subordinated debt investments are subordinated to senior debt and are generally
unsecured. These investments are generally structured with interest-only payments throughout the life of the security with the principal
due at maturity. 

Equity Investments. Preferred and/or common equity investments may be acquired alongside senior
and subordinated debt investment activities or through the exercising of warrants or options attached to debt investments. Income is generated
primarily through regular or inconstant dividends and realized gains on dispositions of such investments. 	 

We intend to meet our investment
objectives by investing primarily in large, privately-negotiated loans to private middle market U.S. companies. Specifically, we expect
a typical borrower to have earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA of 25 million to 100
million and annual revenue ranging from 50 million to 1 billion. We seek to invest in businesses that have a strong reason to exist
and have demonstrated competitive and strategic advantages. These companies generally possess distinguishing business characteristics,
such as a leading competitive position in a well-defined market niche, unique brands, sustainable profitability and cash flow, and experienced
management. We anticipate that a majority of our investments will be classified as senior debt in a borrower s capital structure
and have repayment priority over other parts of a borrower s capital structure (i.e., subordinated debt, preferred and common equity).
By investing in a more senior attachment point of a borrower s capital structure, we expect to protect our principal with less risk, which
we believe provides for a distinctive risk/return profile as compared to that of a typical middle market or private equity alternative
investment. 

In addition to privately-negotiated
loans, we invest in more broadly syndicated assets, such as bank loans and corporate bonds. Our portfolio is more heavily weighted towards
floating-rate investments, whose interest payment obligations may increase in a rising interest rate environment. We may also invest in
fixed-rate investments, options, or other forms of equity participation, and, to a limited extent and not as a principal investment strategy,
structured products such as collateralized loan obligations CLOs and collateralized debt obligations CDOs ).
We seek to make investments which have favorable characteristics, including closing fees, prepayment premiums, lender-friendly control
provisions, and lender-friendly covenants. 

Our portfolio may include covenant-lite 
loans which generally refer to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, covenant-lite 
loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they
are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower s
financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in covenant-lite loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower
and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance
covenants. 

Our portfolio includes investments
in securities that are rated below investment grade (e.g., junk bonds) by rating agencies, or that would be rated below investment grade
if they were rated and have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer s capacity to pay interest and
repay principal. These investments may also be illiquid and feature variances in opinions of fair value and market prices. A material
amount of our debt investments in portfolio companies may contain interest rate reset provisions that may present challenges for the borrowers
to continue paying periodic interest to us. In addition, a material amount of our debt investments may not pay down principal until the
end of their lifetimes, which could result in a substantial loss to us if the portfolio companies are unable to refinance or repay their
debts at maturity. 

31 

Our investment strategy leverages
the skills and depth of Guggenheim s research team and credit investment platform which features a relative value perspective across all
corporate credit asset types. We believe these elements create a larger, proprietary opportunity set and increase the potential for the
generation of a wide spectrum of value-risk investment ideas. We intend for our investment strategy to access investments with attractive
combinations of reward and risk, better economics and stronger lender protections than those offered in traditional loan transactions.
We also intend to deploy our direct loan origination investment platform and apply it to our portfolio company business relationships. 

Our investment activity can and
does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including: the demand for capital from creditworthy privately-owned
U.S. companies, the level of merger, acquisition and refinancing activity involving private companies, the availability of credit to finance
merger and acquisition transactions, the general economic environment, the competitive investment environment for the types of investments
we currently seek and intend to seek in the future, the amount of equity capital we raise from the sale of our Shares, and the amount
of capital we may borrow. 

We acquire our portfolio investments through the following
investment access channels: 

Direct Originations: This channel consists of investments that are directly originated through
Guggenheim s relationship network. Such investments are originated and/or structured by Guggenheim and are not generally available to
the broader investment market. These investments may include both debt and equity investment components. 

Syndicated Transactions: This channel primarily includes investments in broadly syndicated loans
and high yield bonds, typically originated and arranged by investment intermediaries other than Guggenheim. These investments may
be purchased at the original syndication or in the secondary through various trading markets. 

We may continue to borrow money
from time to time within the borrowing limits stipulated by the 1940 Act, which generally allows us to incur leverage of up to 50 of
our total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities. The use of borrowed funds and/or the proceeds
of preferred stock offering to finance investments would have its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing
funds or issuing preferred stock are borne by our shareholders. 

Revenues 

We generate revenues primarily
in the form of interest on the debt securities of portfolio companies that we acquire and hold for investment purposes. Our investments
in debt securities generally have expected maturities of one to eight years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity,
and typically earn interest at floating and fixed interest rates. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable to us quarterly
or semi-annually. The outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due
at the respective maturity dates. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of dividends from preferred and common equity investments,
amortization of original issue discount, prepayment fees, commitment fees, origination fees and fees for providing significant managerial
assistance. 

Operating Expenses 

Our primary operating expenses
include a management fee and, depending on our operating results, a performance-based incentive fee, interest expense, administrative
services, related party reimbursements, custodian and accounting services and other third-party professional services fees and expenses.
The management and performance-based incentive fees compensate Guggenheim for its services in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing
and monitoring our investments.

(1) Percent is calculated as a percentage of the par value of debt investments. 

(2) Duration is a measure of a debt investment s price sensitivity to 100 basis points bps change
in interest rates. It represents an inverse relationship between price and the change in interest rates. For example, if a bond has a
duration of 5.0 years and interest rates increase by 100 bps, then the bond price is expected to decrease by 5 . Weighted average duration
is calculated using weights based on amortized cost. 

(3) Percent is calculated as a percentage of the fair value of total debt investments. 

(4) Weighted average effective yield by investment type is calculated as the effective yield of each investment
and weighted by its amortized cost as compared to the aggregate amortized cost of all investments of that investment type. Effective yield
is the return earned on an investment net of any discount, premium or issuance costs. The total debt portfolio yield is calculated before
considering the impact of leverage or any operating expenses. 

34 

(5) The total investment portfolio yield is calculated before considering the impact of leverage or any operating
expenses, and includes all income generating investments, non-income generating investments and investments on non-accrual status. 

All of our floating interest rate
debt investments have base interest rate reset frequencies of twelve months or less, with the majority resetting at least quarterly. SOFR
ranged between 5.14 for the 1 Month SOFR to 5.36 for the 6 Month SOFR on September 30, 2024.
Base interest rate resets for floating interest rate debt investments will only result in increases in interest income when the base interest
rate exceeds the associated interest rate floor e.g ., 1.0 ).

(1) Income Generating Investments pertains to investments with stated interest rate or preferred returns and
includes investments on non-accrual. 

(2) Income return is calculated using the total interest and dividend income over the average income generating
investments at cost for the period presented. 

The decrease in interest and dividend
income was mainly driven by the decrease in the size of our income generating investments. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30,
2023, yield on debt investments at cost w as 14.2 and 11.2 , respectively. PIK dividend pertains
to dividends on preferred stock investments. 

Our fee income is comprised of
the following fee classifications and is considered non-recurring income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses can be
categorized into fixed operating expenses, variable operating expenses and performance-dependent expenses. Fixed operating expenses are
generally static period over period. Variable expenses are calculated based on fund metrics such as total assets, net assets or total
borrowings. Performance-dependent expenses fluctuate independent of our size.

(1) Related party reimbursements decreased due to a decrease in resource allocation to Master Fund. 

(2) Professional services fees includes the expenses for third party service providers such as internal and
independent auditors, tax return preparer and tax consultant, third-party investment valuers, and fund legal counsel. 

(3) Administrative services fees include the expenses for third party
service providers such as fund accountant, fund sub-administrator, and independent pricing vendors. 

The decrease in total expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the
decrease in management fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no borrowing costs. 

The decrease in total expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease
in management fees. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were no borrowing costs. 

Net Realized Gains (Losses) 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024, we had dispositions and principal repayments of (0.18) million, resul ting in net realized
gain of 0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had dispositions and principal repayments of 13.87 million,
resulting in net realized losses of (3.33) million. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2023, we had dispositions and principal repayments of 10.5 million, resulting in net realized losses of 0.3 million. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, we had dispositions and principal repayments of 27.1 million, resulting in net realized losses of 0.9
million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had realized losses from our foreign currency forward contracts
of 0.0 thousand and and a realized gain of 101.0 thousand, respectively, primarily due the movement of the U.S. dollar against the British
pound. 

For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the components of total realized gains (losses) were comprised of the following:

Annual Investment Returns and Total Returns
Since Commencement 

Our initial investors, who each
invested at 9.00 per share, have seen a cumulative 33.05 increase in the value of their investment, or an annualized return of 2.96 ,
assum ing reinvestment of d istributions. 

The table below presents returns
for our shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the period from commencement to
September 30, 2024. Our performance changes over time and currently may be different than that shown below. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. The returns for shareholders of the affiliated Feeder Funds are different from the returns for our direct
shareholders.

(1) Total investment return is based on (i) the purchase of Common Shares at net asset value on the first
day of the period, (ii) the sale of Common Shares at the net asset value per share on the last day of the period, of (A) all purchased
Common Shares plus (B) any fractional Common Shares issued in connection with the reinvestment of distributions and (iii) distributions
payable relating to the ownership of Common Shares, if any, on the last day of the period. The total investment return calculation assumes
that cash distributions are reinvested concurrent with the issuance of Common Shares at the most recent transaction price on or prior
to each distribution payment date. Since there is no public market for our Common Shares, then the terminal sales price per common share
is assumed to be equal to net asset value per common share on the last day of the period. 

(2) Commencement of operations represents the date that we sold our initial Common Shares. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Unfunded Commitments 

Unfunded commitments to provide
funds to portfolio companies are not recorded on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Our unfunded commitments may be
significant from time to time. Unfunded commitments may expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amount does not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we had one unf unded commitment
totali ng 15.0 thousand as compared to two unfunded
commitments totaling 0.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Se e Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies for specific identification
of the unfunded commitments. We believe we maintain sufficient liquidity in the form of cash, receivables and borrowing capacity to fund
these unfunded commitments should the need arise. See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources . 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our primary sources of cash and
cash equivalents may include: (i) borrowings under various financing arrangements, (ii) cash flows from interest, dividends and transaction
fees earned from investment in portfolio companies and (iii) principal repayments and sale proceeds from our investments. 

Our primary uses of cash and cash
equivalents may inclu de: (i) investments in portfolio companies, (ii) payments of operating expenses,
(iii) interest payments on, and repayment of, borrowings, (iv) cash distributions to our shareholders and (v) periodic repurchases of
our Shares pursuant to our share repurchase program. 

Liquidity 

Operating liquidity is our ability
to meet our short term liquidity needs. The following table presents our operating liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023:

payable, and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. 

39 

Capital Resources 

We may from time to time enter
into additional credit facilities and borrowing arrangements to increase the amount of our borrowings as our equity capital foundation
increases. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty what terms any such financing would have or the costs we would incur in connection
with any such financing arrangements. We are currently required to maintain a minimum asset coverage ratio (total assets-to-senior securities)
of 200 under the 1940 Act. 

The table below summarizes certain
financing obligations and Feeder Fund liquidity targets that are expected to have an impact on our liquidity and cash flow in specified
future interval periods:

(1) The Feeder Fund investment liquidity amounts are based on the net asset value of each Feeder Fund s ownership
interest in the Master Fund as of September 30, 2024. In accordance with the Liquidation Plans, the Board has declared multiple liquidating
distributions. These distributions have been substantially composed of return of capital and have decreased the net asset value of the
Master Fund and Feeder Funds. As such, the value on shareholder s investment statements has decreased as liquidating distributions
have been paid. 

As of September 30, 2024,
GCIF 2016T owned 66.7 of our outstanding Common Shares and GCIF 2019 owned 19.7 of our outstanding Common Shares. The two initial investors
accounted for the remaining 13.6 of our outstanding Common Shares. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Valuation of Investments 

Our investments consist primarily
of investments in senior and subordinated debt of private middle market U.S. companies and are presented in our consolidated financial
statements at fair value. See Note 3. Investments for more information on our investments. As described more fully in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments , a valuation hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective
evidence available regarding value is used to measure the fair value of our investments. Investments for which market quotations are readily
available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from independent pricing services, broker-dealers or market
makers. With respect to our portfolio investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board of Trustees is responsible
for determining in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments in accordance with, and through the consistent application of,
the valuation policy and procedures approved by our Board of Trustees, based on, among other things, the input of Guggenheim and any independent
third-party valuation firms. 

We utilize valuation techniques
that use unobservable inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of our investments classified as Level 3 within the valuation
hierarchy. For senior debt and subordinated debt classified as Level 3 fair value investments, we initially value the investment at its
initial transaction price and subsequently value the investment using (i) market data for similar instruments e.g ., recent
transactions or indicative broker quotes) and/or (ii) valuation models. Valuation models are based on EBITDA multiples to determine
enterprise value and debt multiple ratios where the key inputs are based on relative value analysis of similar credit investments issued
by similar portfolio companies. The valuation techniques used by us for other types of assets that are classified as Level 3 investments
are described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies . The unobservable inputs and assumptions may differ by asset and in the application
of our valuation methodologies. The reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable
inputs and assumptions. 

We and our Board of Trustees conduct
our fair value determination process on a quarterly basis and any other time when a material decision regarding the fair value of our
portfolio investments is required, including in connection with ensuring our compliance with the 1940 Act s requirements regarding the
price at which we issue our Shares. A determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainty
of determining the fair value of portfolio investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of these portfolio
investments may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a readily available market value existed for such
investments. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than exchange-traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio
investment that does not have a readily available market value in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than
the fair value recorded by us.

The table below presents information
on investments classified as Level 3 according to the valuation hierarchy within the investment portfolio on September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023:

an increase or decrease in the associated unobservable inputs. 

In addition to impacting the estimated
fair value recorded for our investments on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, had we used different key unobservable
inputs to determine the estimated fair value of our investments, amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of operations, including
the net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments, management and performance-based incentive fees would also
be impacted. The table below outlines the impact on our results of a 5 increase in the fair value of our Level 3 investments for the

Contractual Obligations 

We have entered into certain agreements
under which we have material future commitments. 

The Master Fund is a party to
an Investment Advisory Agreement with Guggenheim, pursuant to which the Master Fund agreed to pay Guggenheim an investment advisory fee.
See Note 6. Related Party Agreements and Transactions for a more detailed description of the Investment Advisory Agreement. If the Investment
Advisory Agreement is terminated, our costs may increase under any replacement investment advisory agreement that we subsequently enter
into. We would also likely incur expenses in identifying and evaluating candidates to provide the services we expect to receive under
any successor investment advisory agreement and administrative services agreement. Any successor investment advisory agreement would also
be subject to approval by our shareholders. 

In 2015, Hamilton, a wholly-owned,
special purpose financing subsidiary of the Master Fund, initially entered into the Hamilton Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association, as administrative agent, each of the lenders from time to time party thereto, and U.S. Bank National Association,
as collateral agent, collateral administrator and securities intermediary. On June 29, 2018, the Hamilton Credit facility was amended
to extend the term from December 17, 2019 to December 29, 2022 and to extend the draw-down term from December 17, 2018 to December 29,
2021 among other things. On November 29, 2021, Hamilton repaid in full all outstanding amounts due in connection with, and terminated
all commitments under, the Hamilton Credit Facility. See Note 7. Borrowings . 

Related Party Transactions 

We have entered into agreements
with Guggenheim whereby we agreed to pay certain fees to, and reimburse certain expenses, of Guggenheim for investment advisory services
and investment-related and administrative costs incurred on our behalf. See Note 6. Related Party Agreements and Transactions for a discussion
of related party transactions, investment advisory fees and reimbursement of administrative services expenses. 

Organization and Offering Expenses and Reimbursement

Guggenheim has provided administrative
services to the Master Fund since September 11, 2017. We will reimburse Guggenheim, for their expenses in connection with the provision
of administrative services to us. However, such reimbursement will be made at an amount equal to the lower of their actual costs or the
amount that we would be required to pay for comparable administrative services in the same geographic location. Also, such costs will
be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other reasonable allocation methods. We do not reimburse
Guggenheim for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to controlling persons of Guggenheim. 

Co-Investment Transactions Exemptive Relief 

The Master Fund was granted an
SEC exemptive order which grants the Master Fund exemptive relief permitting the Master Fund, subject to the satisfaction of specific
conditions and requirements, to co-invest in privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of Guggenheim. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Interest Rate Risk 

We are subject to financial market
risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 99.5 of our debt investments (98.1 of our total investments),
or 9.3 million m easured at fair value, are subject to floating interest rates. A rise in
the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to (i) higher interest income from our floating rate debt investments and
(ii) value declines for fixed interest rate investments we may hold. Since a majority of our investments consist of floating rate investments,
an increase in interest rates could also make it more difficult for borrowers to repay their loans, and a rise in interest rates may also
make it easier for Guggenheim to meet or exceed the quarterly threshold for performance-based incentive fees as described in Note 6. Related Party Agreements and Transactions . 

42 

The following table presents the
approximate annualized increase (decrease) in (i) interest income from our investment portfolio, (ii) interest expense associated
with our floating rate credit facility and (iii) the net increase or decrease of interest-related income and expense, directly resulting
from hypothetical changes in base interest rates e.g., SOFR), assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio
and capital structure as of September 30, 2024.

We regularly measure our exposure
to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest
rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions
are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our disclosure controls and procedures
include internal controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this
and other reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted that no system of controls
can provide complete assurance of achieving a company s objectives and that future events may impact the effectiveness of a system
of controls. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, after conducting an evaluation, together with members of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective as of September 30, 2024 at a reasonable level of assurance. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the most recent fiscal
quarter, there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined under Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

As of November 13, 2024,
we were not subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or
our subsidiary. 

From time to time, we or Guggenheim
may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of, or incidental to the normal course of, our business, including
legal proceedings related to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. While legal proceedings, lawsuits,
claims and regulatory proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and their ultimate outcomes are not predictable with assurance, the
results of these proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

There have been no material changes
to the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023.
