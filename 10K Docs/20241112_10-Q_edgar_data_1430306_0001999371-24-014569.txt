million over five years to develop TNX-4200, small molecule broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting CD45 for the prevention
or treatment of infections to improve the medical readiness of military personnel in biological threat environments. Tonix owns and operates
a state-of-the art infectious disease research facility in Frederick, MD. Tonix Medicines, our commercial subsidiary, markets Zembrace 
 SymTouch (sumatriptan injection) 3 mg and Tosymra (sumatriptan nasal spray) 10 mg for the treatment of acute
migraine with or without aura in adults. 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
Tonix Sub, Krele LLC, Tonix Pharmaceuticals (Canada), Inc., Tonix Medicines, Inc., Jenner Institute LLC, Tonix R D Center
LLC, Tonix Pharma Holdings Limited and Tonix Pharma Limited (collectively, the Company or Tonix ).
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern
and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities. At September 30,
2024, the Company had working capital of approximately million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of approximately 708.6 million. The Company held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately 28.2 million as of September 30,
2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company engaged CBRE, an international real estate brokerage firm, to potentially
find a strategic partner for, or buyer of, its Advanced Development Center in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts ADC ),
to align with the Company s current business objectives and priorities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have
a commitment in place to sell the ADC. 

The
Company believes that its cash resources at September 30, 2024 and the net proceeds of million that it raised from an equity
offering in the fourth quarter of 2024 (See Note 19), will not meet its operating and capital expenditure requirements through
the first quarter of 2025. 

These
factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to face
significant challenges and uncertainties and must obtain additional funding through public and private financing and collaborative
arrangements with strategic partners to increase the funds available to fund operations. However, the Company may not be able
to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Without additional funds, it may be forced to delay, scale back
or eliminate some or all of its research and development activities or other operations, and potentially delay product development
in an effort to maintain sufficient funds to continue operations. If any of these events occurs, the Company s ability to
achieve development and commercialization goals will be adversely affected and the Company may be forced to cease operations.
Moreover, the Company may default under the terms of its existing indebtedness. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

due to a sustained decline in revenues and continued delays in building out the sales team for its commercialized products, the
Company also tested its commercialized products asset group for recoverability during the second quarter of 2024. The Company

. 

Revenues
from product sales, net of gross-to-net deductions, are recorded only to the extent a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative
revenue recognized is not probable of occurring and when the uncertainty associated with gross-to-net deductions is subsequently
resolved. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers are excluded from product sales. Shipping and
handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation. 

Many
of the Company s products sold are subject to a variety of deductions. Revenues are recognized net of estimated rebates
and chargebacks, cash discounts, distributor fees, sales return provisions and other related deductions. Deductions to product
sales are referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related product sales
occur. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to gross sales in determining
net sales, and as a contra asset within accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid
in cash). Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties
and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The following section briefly describes the nature of the Company s provisions
for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated: 

Chargebacks
 - The Company sells a portion of its products indirectly through wholesaler distributors, and enters into specific agreements
with these indirect customers to establish pricing for the Company s products, and in-turn, the indirect customers and entities
independently purchase these products. Because the price paid by the indirect customers and/or entities is lower than the price
paid by the wholesaler, the Company provides a credit, called a chargeback, to the wholesaler for the difference between the contractual
price with the indirect customers and the wholesale customer s purchase price. The Company s provision for chargebacks
is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler
inventory levels as well as historical chargeback rates. The Company continually monitors its reserve for chargebacks and adjusts
the reserve accordingly when expected chargebacks differ from actual experience. 

Rebates
 - The Company participates in certain government and specific sales rebate programs which provides discounted prescription
drugs to qualified recipients, and primarily relate to Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S., pharmacy rebates, Tri-Care
rebates and discounts, specialty pharmacy program fees and other governmental rebates or applicable allowances. 

Managed Care Rebates
 are processed in the quarter following the quarter in which they are earned. The managed care reporting entity submits utilization
 data after the end of the quarter and the Company processes the payment in accordance with contract terms. All rebates earned
 but not paid are estimated by the Company according to historical payments trended for market growth assumptions. 

Medicaid and State
 Agency rebates are based upon historical experience of claims submitted by various states. The Company monitors Medicaid legislative
 changes to determine what impact such legislation may have on the provision for Medicaid rebates. The accrual of State Agency
 reserves is based on historical payment rates. There is an approximate three-month lag from the time of product sale until
 the rebate is paid. 

Tri-Care represents
 a regionally managed health care program for active duty and retired members, dependents and survivors of the US military.
 The Tri-Care program supplements health care resources of the US military with civilian health care professionals for greater
 access and quality healthcare coverage. Through the Tri-Care program, the Company provides pharmaceuticals on a direct customer
 basis. Prices of pharmaceuticals sold under the Tri-Care program are pre-negotiated and a reserve amount is established to
 represent the proportionate rebate amount associated with product sales. 

Coverage Gap refers
 to the Medicare prescription drug program and represents specifically the period between the initial Medicare Part D prescription
 drug program coverage limit and the catastrophic coverage threshold. Applicable pharmaceutical products sold during this coverage
 gap timeframe are discounted by the Company. Since the nature of the program is that coverage limits are reset at the beginning
 of the calendar year; the payments escalate each quarter as the participants reach the coverage limit before reaching the
 catastrophic coverage threshold. The Company has determined that the cost of this reserve will be viewed as an annual cost.
 Therefore, the accrual will be incurred evenly during the year with quarterly review of the liability based on payment trends
 and any revision to the projected annual cost. 

Prompt-Pay
and other Sales Discounts - The Company provides for prompt pay discounts, which early payments are recorded as a reduction
of revenue and as a reduction in the accounts receivable at the time of sale based on the customer s contracted discount
rate. Consumer sales discounts represent programs the Company has in place to reduce costs to the patient. This includes copay
buy down and eVoucher programs. 

Product
Returns - Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers customers a right to return any unused product. The customer s
right of return commences typically six months prior to product expiration date and ends one year after product expiration date.
Products returned for expiration are reimbursed at current wholesale acquisition cost or indirect contract price. The Company
estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by the Company s customers and accrues this estimate as a
reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company estimates products returns as a percentage
of sales to its customers. The rate is estimated by using historical sales information, including its visibility and estimates
into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel. Adjustments are made to the current provision for returns when data
suggests product returns may differ from original estimates. 

During
the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates.
The Company makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to
it at that time. The Company s clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract
research organizations and other third-party vendors. 

million in funding as a reduction of related research
and development expense . Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets is an additional million which was received
in October 2024 and resulted in a further reduction of research and development expense during the nine months ended September
30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received million in funding as a reduction of related
research and development expense. 

In
June 2024, the Company was awarded a prototype Other Transaction Agreement from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency DTRA ),
an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense, to fund the Company s TNX-4200 program for the development of a small molecule
broad-spectrum antiviral for the prevention or treatment of viral infections to improve the medical readiness of military personnel
in biological threat environments. The DTRA grant provides for payments totaling up to million over five years, which is subject to adjustment based
on costs, scope, budget, and other factors as the program advances. Funding under the DTRA grant is earned and recognized under
a cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangement in which the Company is reimbursed for all direct costs incurred plus allowable indirect costs
and a fixed fee. During the nine months ended September

In
the event that reclassification of contracts between equity and assets or liabilities is necessary, the Company first allocates
remaining authorized shares to equity on the basis of the earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive instruments, with the
earliest issuance date receiving the first allocation of shares. In the event of identical issuance dates, shares are then allocated
to equity beginning with instruments with the latest maturity date first. 

The
classification of derivative instruments is reassessed at each reporting date. If the classification changes as a result of events
during a reporting period, the instrument is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. There
is no limit on the number of times a contract may be reclassified.

The
USL Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805,
 Business Combinations and ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. 
The tangible and intangible assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date, and the difference
between the fair value of these assets and the purchase price has been recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is based upon
preliminary valuations and estimates and assumptions which are subject to change. As the Company receives additional information about
facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the fair values of the acquired inventory and intangible assets may be
adjusted, with the offset recorded to goodwill.

Goodwill 

Fair
 value of assets acquired 

The
acquired inventory consists of Upsher Smith s raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods inventory as of the Closing
date. The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the estimated total costs to complete,
disposal effort and holding costs. 

Developed
 technology - Zembrace 

Total 

The
developed technology intangible assets related to Zembrace and Tosymra includes the value associated with the acquired patents,
customer relationships, and trademarks and trade names associated with the technology. The developed technology intangible assets
were valued as composite assets under the premise that each asset is reliant on one another to generate cash flow, is not considered
separable from the technology, and are assumed to have similar useful lives. The composite intangible assets were valued using
a multi-period excess earnings method and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method
of amortization. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair values of intangible assets include forecasted financial information,
the weighted average cost of capital, customer retention rates, and certain other assumptions. 

The
fair values assigned to the assets acquired are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that market participants would use.
Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. 

Due to a sustained decline in revenues and continued delays in building
out the sales team for its commercialized products, the Company also tested its commercialized products asset group for recoverability
during the second quarter of 2024. The Company determined that the carrying value was not recoverable and therefore estimated the fair
value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow analysis. The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge in the amount of 
million, representing the excess carrying value over the fair value, consisting of million and .0 million for the Zembrace and
Tosymra developed technology intangible assets, respectively, which is reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements
of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As the carrying value of these intangibles is , there were no further impairment
considerations during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Supplemental
Pro Forma Information 

The
following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects the results of operations of the Company for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as if the USL Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2023, and gives effect to transactions
that are directly attributable to the acquisition, including additional amortization expense related to the fair value of intangible
assets acquired and an increase in Cost of Sales related to the acquisition-date fair value adjustment to inventory. On an unaudited
pro forma basis, consolidated Net Product Sales and Net Loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, would have been 
million and million, respectively. These amounts are based on financial information of the acquired business and are not
necessarily indicative of what the Company s operating results would have been had the acquisition taken place on the date
presented, nor is it indicative of the Company s future operating results. The net loss of USL Acquisition business is included
in the Company s consolidated results since the date of acquisition. The revenue and net loss of the USL Acquisition business
reflected in the condensed consolidated statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, is million and
 .0 million, and million and million, respectively. 

As
described above, in connection with the USL Acquisition, the Company and Upsher Smith entered into a Transition Services Agreement
with Upsher Smith related to providing ongoing services associated with the assets acquired, such as procuring and selling migraine
therapy products, providing accounting, and billing services and collecting accounts receivable and paying trade payables. Upsher
Smith collected and will continue to collect cash on behalf of Tonix for revenue generated by sales of the assets acquired from
June 30, 2023, through the transition period and the Seller is obligated to transfer cash generated by such sales to the Company.
On April 1, 2024, the Company amended the transitional services agreement with Upsher Smith so that Upsher Smith will only provide
for the management of certain government rebates. Upsher Smith will be reimbursed by the Company at cost for any rebates they
pay on the Company s behalf.

Additionally,
with the closing of the financing on April 1, 2024, the Company entered into warrant amendments (collectively, the Warrant Amendments with certain holders of its common warrants (referred to herein as the Existing Warrants ). The Company agreed to amend
the exercise price of each Existing Warrant to upon approval by the Company s stockholders of a proposal to allow the Existing
Warrants to become exercisable in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 or, if stockholder approval is not obtained by October 1,
2024, the Company agreed to automatically amend the exercise price of the Existing Warrants to the Minimum Price (as defined in Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5635(d)) of the Company s common stock on October 1, 2024, if and only if the Minimum Price is below the then current
exercise price. Upon stockholder approval, the termination date for the warrants issued August 2023 (the August Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares was amended to ; the termination date for Series A Warrants to purchase
up to an aggregate of approximately shares is ; the termination date for Series B Warrants to purchase up to

of approximately shares is the earlier of (i) and (ii) trading days following notice by the Company to
the Series C Warrant holders of the Company s public announcement of the FDA s acknowledgement and acceptance of the Company s
NDA relating to TNX-102 SL in patients with Fibromyalgia; the termination date for Series D Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of
approximately shares is . The other terms of the Existing Warrants remained unchanged. 

The
Company evaluated the Warrant Amendments as of April 1, 2024, and determined that the potential adjustment to the exercise price that
is contingent on stockholder approval precluded the Existing Warrants from being indexed to the Company s own stock, and as a result,
did not meet the criteria for equity classification under ASC 815-40. The Company accounted for the Warrant Amendments as a direct and
incremental cost of the March 2024 financing and recognized the incremental fair value resulting from the modified terms of approximately
 .0 million as an offset to the proceeds received. As all of the Existing Warrants were equity-classified prior to the Warrant Amendments,
the net impact to the condensed consolidated statement of stockholders equity was zero. The Company then reclassified the Existing
Warrants from equity to liabilities at post-modification fair value on April 1, 2024. 

On
May 22, 2024, at the annual meeting of the Company s stockholders, the Company s stockholders approved the proposal to amend
the exercise prices of the Existing Warrants to per share and extend the expiration dates. The Company determined the Existing
Warrants met all of the criteria for equity classification as of the approval date. The Existing Warrants were adjusted to fair value
through May 22, 2024, when the warrants were reclassified to equity. Changes in the fair value of the liability-classified warrants were
recognized as a separate component in the consolidated statement of operations. 

December
2023 Financing 

On
December 20, 2023, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with certain institutional
investors, pursuant to which the Company sold and issued (i) shares of the Company s common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants
(the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock and (iii) Series C warrants to purchase up to
 shares of common stock (the Series C Warrants ), and (iv) Series D warrants to purchase up to shares
of common stock (the Series D Warrants and, together with the Series C Warrants, the Common Warrants ). The
securities sold in the offering were sold in fixed combinations as units. The offering price per share of common stock and accompanying
Common Warrants was , and the offering price per Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrants was . The offering
closed on December 22, 2023, generating gross proceeds of approximately .0 million, before deducting offering expenses of million
payable by the Company. At the closing of the offering, Pre-Funded Warrants were immediately exercised into shares of common
stock for nominal proceeds. 

The
Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of per share, are immediately exercisable subject to certain ownership limitations,
and can be exercised at any time until exercised in full. The Series C Warrants have an exercise price of per share, and are exercisable
on the later of approval by the Company s stockholders of (i) a proposal to approve the filing of an amendment to the Company s
Articles of Incorporation, increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from to and (ii) a proposal
to allow the Warrants to become exercisable in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (the later of such events, the Approval

anniversary of the Approval Date and (y) trading days following the public announcement of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s FDA acknowledgement and acceptance of the New Drug Application NDA relating to the Company s TNX-102
SL product candidate in patients with fibromyalgia. The Series D Warrants have an exercise price of per share and are exercisable
beginning on the Approval Date through the five-year anniversary of the Approval Date. 

Upon
the closing of the offering, the Company determined that certain of the Common Warrants did not meet the criteria for equity classification
due to the lack of sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the instruments. The Company has adopted a sequencing approach
under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity to determine the classification of its contracts at
issuance and at each subsequent reporting date, whereby shares are allocated based on the earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive
instruments, with the earliest issuance date receiving the first allocation of shares. In the event of identical issuance dates, shares
are then allocated beginning with instruments with the latest maturity date first. Pursuant to this sequencing approach, the Company s
authorized and unissued shares were applied to the Pre-Funded Warrants and the Common Warrants in the following order: (i) the Pre-Funded
Warrants, (ii) the Series D Warrants, and (iii) the Series C Warrants. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that the authorized
shares are sufficient to settle the remaining Pre-Funded Warrants and Series D Warrants and were therefore classified in equity.
The remaining Series D Warrants and the Series C Warrants associated with the deficit shares were classified as liabilities and
are accounted for at fair value. 

The
 .0 million in gross proceeds received by the Company were first allocated to the Series C Warrants and the liability-classified Series
D Warrants at their respective fair values of approximately million and million, respectively. The residual proceeds of approximately
 million were allocated to the shares of common stock, the Pre-Funded Warrants, and the equity-classified Series D Warrants on a
relative fair value basis. The issuance costs totaling million were allocated between the equity and liability-classified instruments
on a relative fair value basis. Issuance costs of million allocated to the shares, the Pre-Funded Warrants, and the equity-classified
Series D Warrants were recognized as a discount to the proceeds allocated to the equity-classified instruments. Issuance costs of 
million were allocated to the liability-classified Series D Warrants and the Series C Warrants and expensed within Selling, general and
administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 

On
January 25, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved the proposal to file an amendment to the Company s Articles
of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from to . 

The
liability-classified Series D Warrants and all of the Series C Warrants were presented within non-current liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, and were adjusted to fair value through January 25, 2024, when the warrants were reclassified
to equity. Changes in the fair value of the liability-classified warrants were recognized as a separate component in the consolidated

The Amended and Restated 2020 Plan initially provided for the issuance of up to shares of common stock, which amount will
be increased to the extent that awards granted under the Plans are forfeited, expire or are settled for cash (except as otherwise
provided in the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan). In addition, the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan contains an evergreen
provision providing for an annual increase in the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the
Amended and Restated 2020 Plan on January 1 of each year for a period of ten years, commencing on January 1, 2021 and ending on
(and including) January 1, 2030, in an amount equal to the difference between (x) twenty percent of the total number of
shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, and (y) the total number of shares of common
stock reserved under the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan on December 31 st of such preceding calendar year (including
shares subject to outstanding awards, issued pursuant to awards or available for future awards). The Board of Directors determines
the exercise price, vesting and expiration period of the grants under the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan. However, the exercise
price of an incentive stock option may not be less than of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a
10 or more shareholder and of fair value for a grantee who is not a 10 shareholder. The fair value of the common stock
is determined based on quoted market price or in absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in good faith.
Additionally, the expiration period of grants under the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan may not be more than ten years. As of September
30, 2024, options were available for future grants under the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan.

The
Company measures the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, based on the Black Scholes option pricing model using certain
assumptions discussed below, and the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair

from the date of grant and 1/36 th each month thereafter for 24 months and expire from the date of grant. In addition,
the Company issues options to directors which vest over a one-year period. The Company also issues premium options to executive
officers which have an exercise price greater than the grant date fair value and has issued performance-based options which vest
when target parameters are met or probable of being met, subject in each case to a one year minimum service period prior to vesting.

Business
Overview 

We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming
therapies for pain management and vaccines for public health challenges. Our priority is to advance our TNX-102 SL product candidate for
the management of fibromyalgia, for which a New Drug Application NDA was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA in October 2024, based on two statistically significant Phase 3 studies. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to
TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia in the third quarter. We expect an FDA decision on the acceptance of the NDA for review
and PDUFA date in December and if accepted, a decision on NDA approval in 2025. Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain condition that affects
mostly women. Fibromyalgia is now recognized as the prototypic nociplastic pain syndrome. TNX-102 SL is a non-opioid, centrally acting
analgesic developed for long-term use in fibromyalgia. If approved, TNX-102 SL would be the first new drug therapy for fibromyalgia in
more than 15 years. TNX-102 SL is also being developed to treat acute stress reaction and acute stress disorder under a Physician-Initiated
Investigational New Drug application IND at the University of North Carolina in the OASIS study funded by the U.S. Department
of Defense (DoD). We expect to initiate enrollment in the OASIS study in the fourth quarter. Tonix s CNS portfolio includes TNX-1300
(cocaine esterase), a biologic drug candidate in Phase 2 development designed to treat cocaine intoxication that has FDA Breakthrough
Therapy designation, and its development is supported by a grant from the U.S. National Institute of Drug Abuse. Our immunology development
portfolio includes TNX-1500, which is an Fc-modified humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD40-ligand (CD40L or CD154) in Phase 1 development
for the prevention of allograft rejection and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. TNX-1700 is a fusion protein of TFF2 and albumin
and is in the pre-IND stage of development to treat gastric and pancreatic cancer. We also have pre-clinical product candidates in development
in the areas of rare disease, including TNX-2900 for Prader-Willi syndrome, and infectious disease, including TNX-801 a potential vaccine
to prevent mpox and smallpox. We recently announced a contract with the U.S. DoD s Defense Threat Reduction Agency DTRA for up to 34 million over five years to develop TNX-4200, small molecule broad-spectrum antiviral agents targeting CD45 for the prevention
or treatment of infections to improve the medical readiness of military personnel in biological threat environments. We own and operate
a state-of-the art infectious disease research facility in Frederick, MD. Tonix Medicines, our commercial subsidiary, markets Zembrace 
SymTouch (sumatriptan injection) 3 mg and Tosymra (sumatriptan nasal spray) 10 mg for the treatment of
acute migraine with or without aura in adults. 

Our
product development candidates are investigational new drugs or biologics and have not been approved for any indication. 

Zembrace
SymTouch and Tosymra are registered trademarks of Tonix Medicines. All other marks are the property of their respective
owners.

Results
of Operations 

We
anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors, such as the sales of Zembrace 
 and Tosymra , the progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory submissions.
Due to these uncertainties, accurate predictions of future operations are difficult or impossible to make.

Our
direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs for clinical, nonclinical and manufacturing, such
as fees paid to contractors, consultants and contract research organizations in connection with our development work. Included
in Internal Staffing, Overhead and Other is overhead, supplies, research and development employee costs (including
stock option expenses), travel, regulatory and legal. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were
 24.5 million, an increase of 1.4 million, or 6 , from 23.1 million incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase is primarily due to an increase in financial reporting expenses of 1.1 million, related to the special shareholder meetings
in 2024, an increase in sales and marketing of 0.5 million, an increase in depreciation of property and equipment of 0.3 million
and an increase in fees and permits of 0.4 million, related to licenses obtained to sell the migraine products, offset by a decrease
in employee-related costs of 1.0 million, due to less employees. 

Asset
impairment charges . We recognized a non-cash impairment charge of 48.8 million related to property and equipment, a non-cash
impairment of 1.0 million related to goodwill, and a non-cash impairment charge of 9.2 million related to intangible assets,
which is reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. 

The
impairment of the Tosymra and Zembrace inventory, intangibles and goodwill was driven by our delayed investment in the sales personnel
required to drive growth in the business as we are focusing our cash resources to further our efforts to bring TNX-102 SL through
the approval process and to market. However, we believe that the benefits and long-term value proposition of the 2023 acquisition
of Tosymra and Zembrace remain, in that we now have the infrastructure to be ready to manufacture and sell TNX-102 SL under an
expedited timeline pending FDA approval for which we expect an FDA decision in 2025. 

Net
Loss . As a result of the foregoing, the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 107.9 million, an increase
of 18.6 million, or 21 , compared to a net loss of 89.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

License
Agreements 

On
February 13, 2023, we exercised an option to obtain an exclusive license from Columbia for the development of a portfolio of fully
human and murine mAbs for the treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including our TNX-3600 and TNX-4100 product candidates,
respectively. The licensed mAbs were developed as part of a research collaboration and option agreement between us and Columbia.
As of September 30, 2024, other than the upfront fee, no payments have been accrued or paid in relation to this agreement. 

Asset
Purchase Agreements 

On
June 23, 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Upsher Smith for the acquisition of certain assets related to
Zembrace and Tosymra (such businesses collectively, the Business and certain inventory related to the Business
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 26.5 million, including certain deferred payments (such transaction, the USL
Acquisition ). The transaction closed on June 30, 2023. 

Additionally,
in connection with the acquisition from Upsher Smith, we and Upsher Smith entered into a transition services agreement pursuant
to which Upsher Smith agreed to provide certain transition services to us for base fees equal to 100,000 per month for the first
six months, and 150,000 per month for the seventh through ninth months, plus additional monthly fees for each service category
totaling up to 150,000 per month. We have signed an amendment to the transitional services agreement with Upsher Smith so that
Upsher Smith will continue to manage certain government rebates, and Upsher Smith will be reimbursed by us at cost for any rebates
they pay on our behalf. 

As
the assets acquired from Upsher Smith met the definition of a business under the current accounting guidance, the total purchase
price was allocated to the acquired inventory and other tangible assets, and the developed technology intangible assets related
to Zembrace and Tosymra based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the acquired assets was recorded as goodwill. 

We
have assumed certain obligations of Upsher Smith, including the payment of quarterly royalty payments on annual net sales from
the Business in the U.S. as follows: for Tosymra, 4 for net sales of 0 to 30 million, 7 of net sales of 30 to 75 million;
9 for net sales of 75 to 100 million; 12 for net sales of 100 to 150 million; and 15 for net sales greater than 150 million.
Royalty payments with respect to Tosymra are payable until the expiration or termination of the product s Orange Book listed
patent(s) with respect to the United States or, outside the United States, the expiration of the last valid claim covering the
product in the relevant country of the territory. For Zembrace, royalty payments on annual net sales in the U.S. are 3 for net
sales of 0 to 30 million, 6 of net sales of 30 to 75 million; 12 for net sales of 75 to 100 million; 16 for net sales
of greater than 100 million. Such royalty payments are payable until July 19, 2025. Upon the entry of a generic version of the
relevant product, the applicable royalty rates will be reduced by 90 percent for Zembrace, and by 66.7 percent for Tosymra. 

In
addition, we have assumed the obligation to pay an additional 3 royalty on net sales of Tosymra, plus an additional 3 if a patent
containing certain claims related to Tosymra issues in the U.S., for 15 years from the first commercial sale of Tosymra in the
applicable country or for as long as the manufacture, use or sale of Tosymra in such country is covered by a valid claim of a
licensed patent, and up to 15 million per Tosymra product on the achievement of sales milestones. 

On
February 2, 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Healion Bio Inc., pursuant
to which we acquired all the pre-clinical infectious disease assets of Healion for 1.2 million. Because the Healion intellectual
property was acquired prior to FDA approval, the 1.2 million cash consideration was expensed as research and development costs
since there is no alternative future use and the acquired intellectual property does not constitute a business.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As of September 30,
2024, we had working capital of 35.4 million, comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents of 28.2 million, Accounts receivable,
net of 4.0 million, Inventory of 7.9 million and prepaid expenses and other of 10.4 million, offset by 3.9 million of accounts
payable, 8.1 million of accrued expenses, short-term loan payable of 2.8 million, and current lease liabilities of 0.3 million.
A significant portion of the accounts payable and accrued expenses are due to work performed in relation to our clinical programs,
and the operations related to Zembrace and Tosymra. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we engaged CBRE, an international real estate
brokerage firm, to potentially find a strategic partner for, or buyer of, our Advanced Development Center in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts ADC ), to align with our current business objectives and priorities. Currently, we do not have a commitment in place
to sell the ADC. 

The
following table provides a summary of operating, investing and financing cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023, respectively (in thousands):

 (4,198 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we used approximately 46.3 million and 79.7 million of cash in operating activities, respectively,
which represents cash outlays for research and development and general and administrative expenses in such periods. The decrease
in cash outlays principally resulted from a decrease in research and development activities. For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 49.7 million predominately from the issuance of common stock offset by
the deferred payment to USL. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was 4.2 million,
predominately from the repurchase of our common stock. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 was 0.1 million related to the purchase of property and equipment, and 28.6 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 related to the purchase of the USL assets and property and equipment. 

We
believe that our cash resources at September 30, 2024, and the proceeds that we raised from equity offerings subsequent to the
end of the third quarter of 2024 will meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements into the first quarter of 2025,
but not beyond. 

We
continue to face significant challenges and uncertainties and, as a result, our available capital resources may be consumed more
rapidly than currently expected due to changes we may make in our research and development spending plans. These factors raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the one year period from the date of filing of this Form
10-Q. We have the ability to obtain additional funding through public or private financing or collaborative arrangements with
strategic partners to increase the funds available to fund operations. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale
back or eliminate some or all of our research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development
in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations. If any of these events occurs, our ability to achieve our
development and commercialization goals will be adversely affected. 

Future
Liquidity Requirements 

We
expect to incur losses from operations for the near future. We expect to decrease our operating costs to align the Company s
capital and human resources with its previously announced strategic prioritization of TNX-102 SL product candidate for the management
of fibromyalgia. We will not have enough resources to meet our operating requirements for the one-year period from filing date
of this report. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including the progress of our research and development of product
candidates, the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining,
defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability
of financing and our success in developing markets for our product candidates. 

44 

We
will need to obtain additional capital in order to fund future research and development activities and future capital expenditures.
Future financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms.
Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect
significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.
Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, shareholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity
securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. 

If
additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of
or eliminate our research and development programs, reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements
with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise
seek to develop or commercialize independently.

July 30, 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement with AGP pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of

Additionally,
with the closing of the financing on April 1, 2024, we entered into warrant amendments (collectively, the Warrant Amendments with certain holders of our common warrants (referred to herein as the Existing Warrants ). We agreed to amend the
exercise price of each Existing Warrant to 10.56 upon approval by our stockholders of a proposal to allow the Existing Warrants
to become exercisable in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 or, if stockholder approval is not obtained by October 1, 2024,
we agreed to automatically amend the exercise price of the Existing Warrants to the Minimum Price (as defined in Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5635(d)) of our common stock on October 1, 2024 if and only if the Minimum Price is below the then current exercise price.
Upon stockholder approval on May 22, 2024, the termination date for the warrants issued August 2023 (the August Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 217,188 shares was amended to April 1, 2029; the termination date for Series A Warrants to purchase

meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved the proposal to amend the exercise prices of the Existing Warrants to 10.56
per share and extend the expiration dates. 

December
2023 Financing 

On
December 20, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with certain institutional
investors, pursuant to which we sold and issued (i) 791,977 shares of our common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded
Warrants to purchase up to 897,213 shares of common stock and (iii) Series C warrants to purchase up to 2,533,784 shares
of common stock (the Series C Warrants ), and (iv) Series D warrants to purchase up to 2,533,784 shares of common
stock (the Series D Warrants and, together with the Series C Warrants, the Common Warrants ). The securities
sold in the offering were sold in fixed combinations as units. The offering price per share of common stock and accompanying Common
Warrants was 17.76, and the offering price per Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Common Warrants was 17.7568. The offering
closed on December 22, 2023, generating gross proceeds of approximately 30.0 million, before deducting offering expenses of 2.3
million payable by us. At the closing of the offering, 203,407 Pre-Funded Warrants were immediately exercised into shares of common
stock for nominal proceeds. 

The
Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of 0.0001 per share, are immediately exercisable subject to certain ownership limitations,
and can be exercised at any time until exercised in full. The Series C Warrants have an exercise price of 17.76 per share, and
are exercisable on the later of approval by our stockholders of (i) a proposal to approve the filing of an amendment to our Articles
of Incorporation, increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 160,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 and (ii) a proposal
to allow the Warrants to become exercisable in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (the later of such events, the Approval
Date and will expire on the later of (a) 10 trading days following the Approval Date and (b) the earlier of (x) the two
year anniversary of the Approval Date and (y) 10 trading days following the public announcement of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s FDA acknowledgement and acceptance of the New Drug Application NDA relating to our TNX-102 SL
product candidate in patients with fibromyalgia. The Series D Warrants have an exercise price of 27.20 per share and are exercisable
beginning on the Approval Date through the five-year anniversary of the Approval Date. 

Upon
the closing of the offering, we determined that certain of the Common Warrants did not meet the criteria for equity classification
due to the lack of sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the instruments. We have adopted a sequencing approach
under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity to determine the classification of its contracts
at issuance and at each subsequent reporting date, whereby shares are allocated based on the earliest issuance date of potentially
dilutive instruments, with the earliest issuance date receiving the first allocation of shares. In the event of identical issuance
dates, shares are then allocated beginning with instruments with the latest maturity date first. Pursuant to this sequencing approach,
our authorized and unissued shares were applied to the Pre-Funded Warrants and the Common Warrants in the following order: (i)
the Pre-Funded Warrants, (ii) the Series D Warrants, and (iii) the Series C Warrants. Based on this analysis, we determined that
the authorized shares are sufficient to settle the remaining Pre-Funded Warrants and 1,591,665 Series D Warrants and were therefore
classified in equity. The remaining 942,120 Series D Warrants and the Series C Warrants associated with the deficit shares were
classified as liabilities and are accounted for at fair value. 

46 

The
 30.0 million in gross proceeds received by us was first allocated to the Series C Warrants and the liability-classified Series
D Warrants at their respective fair values of approximately 14.4 million and 8.1 million, respectively. The residual proceeds
of approximately 7.5 million were allocated to the shares of common stock, the Pre-Funded Warrants, and the equity-classified
Series D Warrants on a relative fair value basis. The issuance costs totaling 2.3 million were allocated between the equity and
liability-classified instruments on a relative fair value basis. Issuance costs of 1.4 million allocated to the shares, the Pre-Funded
Warrants, and the equity-classified Series D Warrants were recognized as a discount to the proceeds allocated to the equity-classified
instruments. Issuance costs of 0.9 million were allocated to the liability-classified Series D Warrants and the Series C Warrants
and expensed within Selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 

On
January 25, 2024, our stockholders approved the proposal to file an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase the
number of authorized shares of common stock from 160,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. 

The
liability-classified Series D Warrants and all of the Series C Warrants were presented within non-current liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, and were adjusted to fair value through January 25, 2024, when the warrants were reclassified
to equity. Changes in the fair value of the liability-classified warrants were recognized as a separate component in the consolidated
statement of operations. 

September
2023 Financing 

On
September 28, 2023, we sold 126,563 shares of common stock; pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 154,687 shares of common stock,

exercise price of 16.00 per share and expiring one year from date of issuance in a public offering, which closed on October 3,
2023. The offering price per share of common stock and accompanying warrants was 16.00, and the offering price per share of pre-funded
warrant and accompanying warrants was 15.99. 

We
incurred offering expenses of approximately 0.5 million, including placement agent fees of approximately 0.3 million. We received
net proceeds of approximately 4.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses.

Pursuant
to the terms of the 2022 Purchase Agreement, at the time we signed the 2022 Purchase Agreement and the 2022 Registration Rights
Agreement, we issued 3,125 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our
common stock under the 2022 Purchase Agreement. The commitment shares were valued at 1,000,000 and recorded as an addition to
equity for the issuance of the common stock and treated as a reduction to equity as a cost of capital to be raised under the 2022
Purchase Agreement. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 0 and 3,000 shares, respectively, of common stock under the 2022 Purchase
Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 0 and 0.4 million, respectively. No shares were sold during 2024 under the 2022 Purchase

At-the-Market
Offerings 

On
April 8, 2020, we entered into a sales agreement (the Sales Agreement with AGP pursuant to which we may issue and
sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 320.0 million in at-the-market
offerings ATM sales. AGP will act as sales agent and will be paid a 3 commission on each sale under the Sales

Share
Repurchase Program 

In
September 2024, the Board of Directors approved a 2024 share repurchase program pursuant
to which we may repurchase up to 10.0 million in value of our outstanding common stock from time to time on the open
market and in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, share price and other factors. No
repurchases occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

During
the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased 78,502 of our shares of common stock outstanding under the 2022 share repurchase program
for 12.5 million at prices ranging from 88.00 to 275.52 per share for a gross aggregate cost of approximately 12.5 million .
In addition, we incurred expenses of 0.3 million. 

In
January 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new 2023 share repurchase program pursuant
to which we may repurchase up to an additional 12.5 million in value of our outstanding common stock from time to time
on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, share price and other factors. During
the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased 5,000 of our shares of common stock outstanding
under the new 2023 share repurchase program at 227.84 per share for a gross aggregate cost of 1.1 million . 

Debt
Financing 

On
December 8, 2023, we executed a Loan and Guaranty Agreement (the Loan Agreement to issue a 36-month term loan (the
 Term Loan in the principal amount of 11.0 million with a maturity date of December 8, 2026 (the Maturity
Date ). The Term Loan was funded with an original issue discount of 9 of the principal amount of the Term Loan, or 1.0
million, which is being amortized over the term of the debt as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the outstanding
borrowings. 

Borrowings
under the Term Loan bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate as defined in the Loan Agreement
plus 3.5 and (ii) 12 . Interest is payable monthly in arrears commencing in December 2023. In connection with the Term Loan,
we deposited into a reserve account 1.8 million to be used exclusively to fund interest payments related to the Term Loan. The
deposit is reflected as prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 

48 

Commencing
on March 8, 2024 and continuing monthly through the Maturity Date, the outstanding principal will be due and payable in monthly
installments of 0.2 million, with the final remaining balance of unpaid principal and interest due and payable on the Maturity
Date. In addition, we must pay a monthly collateral monitoring charge equal to 0.23 of the outstanding principal amount of the
term loan as of the date of payment. We incurred 1.1 million in issuance costs, which is being amortized over the term of
the debt as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the outstanding borrowings. 

The
Loan Agreement provides for voluntary prepayments of the Term Loan, in whole or in part, subject to a prepayment premium. The
Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants by us, which among other things, will require us to provide
certain financial reports to the lenders, to maintain a deposit account to fund interest payments, and limit the ability of us

Stock
Compensation 

On
May 1, 2020, our stockholders approved the Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. Amended and Restated 2020 Stock Incentive Plan Amended and Restated 2020 Plan ). 

Under
the terms of the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan, we may issue (1) stock options (incentive and nonstatutory), (2) restricted stock,
(3) stock appreciation rights SARs ), (4) RSUs, (5) other stock-based awards, and (6) cash-based awards. The Amended
and Restated 2020 Plan initially provided for the issuance of up to 1,563 shares of common stock, which amount will be increased
to the extent that awards granted under the Plans are forfeited, expire or are settled for cash (except as otherwise provided
in the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan). In addition, the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan contains an evergreen provision 
providing for an annual increase in the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the Amended and Restated
2020 Plan on January 1 of each year for a period of ten years, commencing on January 1, 2021 and ending on (and including) January
1, 2030, in an amount equal to the difference between (x) twenty percent (20 of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding
on December 31st of the preceding calendar year, and (y) the total number of shares of common stock reserved under the Amended
and Restated 2020 Plan on December 31 st of such preceding calendar year (including shares subject to outstanding awards,
issued pursuant to awards or available for future awards). The Board of Directors determines the exercise price, vesting and expiration
period of the grants under the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan. However, the exercise price of an incentive stock option may not
be less than 110 of fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant for a 10 or more shareholder and 100 of fair value
for a grantee who is not a 10 shareholder. The fair value of the common stock is determined based on quoted market price or in
absence of such quoted market price, by the Board of Directors in good faith. Additionally, the expiration period of grants under
the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan may not be more than ten years. As of September 30, 2024, 10,168 options were available for
future grants under the Amended and Restated 2020 Plan. 

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on options with an exercise
price less than our closing stock price at the respective dates. 

The
weighted average fair value of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 2024 was 0.15 per share and 8.68
per share, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 2023
was 26.88 per share and 127.68 per share, respectively. 

49 

We
measure the fair value of stock options on the date of grant, based on the Black Scholes option pricing model using certain assumptions
discussed below, and the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of the award is measured
on the grant date. One-third of most stock options granted pursuant to the Plans vest 12 months from the date of grant and 1/36th
each month thereafter for 24 months and expire ten years from the date of grant. In addition, we issue options to directors which
vest over a one-year period. We also issue premium options to executive officers which have an exercise price greater than the
grant date fair value and has issued performance-based options which vest when target parameters are met or probable of being
met, subject in each case to a one year minimum service period prior to vesting. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards
is amortized over the applicable service period using the straight-line method. 

The
risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of Daily U.S. Treasury Yield Curve Rates with terms equal to the expected term of
the options as of the grant date. The expected term of options is determined using the simplified method, as provided in an SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin, and the expected stock price volatility is based on our historical stock price volatility. 

Stock-based
compensation expense relating to options granted of 1.0 million, of which 0.7 million and 0.3 million, related to General and
Administration and Research and Development, respectively, was recognized for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Stock-based
compensation expense relating to options granted of 2.1 million, of which 1.4 million and 0.7 million, related to General and
Administration and Research and Development, respectively, was recognized for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

Stock-based
compensation expense relating to options granted of 3.9 million, of which 2.8 million and 1.1 million, related to General and
Administration and Research and Development, respectively was recognized for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Stock-based
compensation expense relating to options granted of 7.2 million, of which 5.0 million and 2.2 million, related to General and
Administration and Research and Development, respectively was recognized for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 4.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards
granted under the Plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.73 years. 

Employee
Stock Purchase Plans 

On
May 6, 2022, our stockholders approved the Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holdings Corp. 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. (the 2022
ESPP ), which was replaced by the Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holdings Corp. 2023 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2023
ESPP , and together with the 2022 ESPP, the ESPP Plans ), which was approved by our stockholders on May 5,
2023. 

The
2023 ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase up to an aggregate of 25,000 shares of our common stock. Under the 2023
ESPP, on the first day of each offering period, each eligible employee for that offering period has the option to enroll for that
offering period, which allows the eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of the offering period.
Each offering period under the 2023 ESPP is for six months, which can be modified from time-to-time. Subject to limitations, each
participant will be permitted to purchase a number of shares determined by dividing the employee s accumulated payroll
deductions for the offering period by the applicable purchase price, which is equal to 85 percent of the fair market
value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever is less. A participant must designate in
his or her enrollment package the percentage (if any) of compensation to be deducted during that offering period for the purchase
of stock under the 2023 ESPP, subject to the statutory limit under the Code. As of September 30, 2024, 22,926 shares were available
for future sales under the 2023 ESPP. 

The
ESPP Plans are considered compensatory plans with the related compensation cost expensed over the six-month offering period. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 27,000 and 34,000, respectively, was expensed. In January 2023, 469 shares
that were purchased as of December 31, 2022, under the 2022 ESPP, were issued. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2023,
approximately 29,000 of employee payroll deductions accumulated at December 31, 2022, related to acquiring such shares, was transferred
from accrued expenses to additional paid in capital. The remaining 14,000 was returned to the employees. As of December 31, 2023,
approximately 44,000 of employee payroll deductions had accumulated and had been recorded in accrued expenses. In January
2024, 2,074 shares that were purchased as of December 31, 2023, under the 2022 ESPP, were issued. Accordingly, during the first
quarter of 2024, approximately 24,000 of employee payroll deductions accumulated at December 31, 2023, related to acquiring such
shares, was transferred from accrued expenses to additional paid in capital. The remaining 20,000 was returned to the employees.
As of June 30, 2024, approximately 33,000 of employee payroll deductions had accumulated and had been recorded in accrued expenses. In
July 2024, 6,927 shares that were purchased as of June 30, 2024, under the 2022 ESPP, were issued. Accordingly, during the third
quarter of 2024, approximately 4,000 of employee payroll deductions accumulated at June 30, 2024, related to acquiring such shares,
was transferred from accrued expenses to additional paid in capital. The remaining 29,000 was returned to the employees.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities
and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. 

We
believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements. 

Business
Combinations. We apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring
entity recognizes all of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. We use
our best estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair values of these tangible and intangible assets. Any excess of the purchase
price over amounts allocated to the assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The acquired intangible assets are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual
basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired.

Asset
impairment charges. We test certain assets for impairment, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles, long-lived assets
and amortizing intangibles. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair
value on an annual basis as of June 30, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of goodwill may be impaired. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors
and circumstances exist, we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of
assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess
of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those
assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. 

51 

We completed the required
annual impairment test for goodwill as of June 30, 2024, primarily using an income approach or discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally,
due to a sustained decline in revenues and continued delays in building out the sales team for our commercialized products, we
also tested the commercialized products asset group for recoverability as of June 30, 2024, and determined that the carrying value
was not recoverable and therefore estimated the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow analysis. The significant
assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model included revenue growth, long-term growth rate, and discounts rate. The impairment
assessments resulted in full non-cash impairment of 965,000 of goodwill and 9.2 million, consisting of 6.2 million and 3.0
million for the Zembrace and Tosymra developed technology, intangible assets, which are reflected in asset impairment charges in
the consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

During
the second quarter of 2024, we identified certain triggering events related to the ADC and the decommissioning of the ADC. The
Company determined that the carrying value of the ADC was not recoverable and that the carrying value exceeded its fair value.
We engaged independent appraisers to value the building and land, using sales comparison and income capitalization approaches,
and the related fixed assets using a indirect cost approach and market approach. The assessments resulted in a non-cash impairment
charge of 48.8 million, which is reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. 

Revenue
Recognition. Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in
the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, prompt pay and
other sales discounts, and product returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge
and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. We began
recognizing revenue following the completion of the USL Acquisition, beginning July 1, 2023, and required variable consideration
estimates are currently primarily based on the acquired products historical results. Adjustments to these estimates to reflect
actual results or updated expectations will be assessed each period. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences,
or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The
potential of our estimates to vary differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. In addition, estimates
associated with U.S. Medicare and Medicaid governmental rebate programs are at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive
time delay. 

Research
and Development. We outsource certain of our research and development efforts and expense the related costs as incurred, including
the cost of manufacturing product for testing, licensing fees and costs associated with planning and conducting clinical trials.
The value ascribed to patents and other intellectual property acquired was expensed as research and development costs, as it related
to particular research and development projects and had no alternative future uses. 

We
estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations
under contracts with vendors, consultants and clinical research organizations and clinical site agreements in connection with
conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract
and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts.
We account for trial expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by participant progression and the timing of
various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and
outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. During the course of
a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of
our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical
trial accruals and prepaid assets are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and
other third-party vendors. 

52 

Stock-Based
Compensation. All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors consisted of
grants of restricted stock and stock options, which are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations as compensation expense over the relevant vesting period. In addition, for awards that vest immediately
and are nonforfeitable, the measurement date is the date the award is issued. 

Deferred
financing costs. Deferred financing costs represent the cost of obtaining financing arrangements and are amortized over the term
of the related debt agreement using the effective interest method. Deferred financing costs related to term debt arrangements
are reflected as a direct reduction of the related debt liability on the consolidated balance sheet. Amortization of deferred
financing costs is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Original
issue discount. Certain term debt issued by the Company provides the debt holder with an original issue discount. Original issue
discounts are reflected as a direct reduction of the related debt liability on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized
over the term of the related debt agreement using the effective interest method. Amortization of original issue discounts are
included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Derivative
Instruments and Warrant Liabilities. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued warrants to purchase
common stock under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features
that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative
instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value
reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates, which is adjusted for instrument-specific terms as applicable. 

From
time to time, certain equity-linked instruments may be classified as derivative liabilities due to the Company having insufficient
authorized shares to fully settle the equity-linked financial instruments in shares. In such a case, the Company has adopted a
sequencing approach under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity to determine the classification
of its contracts at issuance and at each subsequent reporting date. If reclassification of contracts between equity and assets
or liabilities is necessary, the Company first allocates remaining authorized shares to equity on the basis of the earliest issuance
date of potentially dilutive instruments, with the earliest issuance date receiving the first allocation of shares. In the event
of identical issuance dates, shares are then allocated to equity beginning with instruments with the latest maturity date first. 

The
classification of derivative instruments is reassessed at each reporting date. If the classification changes as a result of events
during a reporting period, the instrument is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. There
is no limit on the number of times a contract may be reclassified. 

Other
than contractual obligations incurred in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements
or liabilities, guarantee contracts, retain or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material
variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In
November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting--Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires incremental disclosures about
a public entity s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable
segments. The new guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are (1) regularly provided to (or easily computed
from information regularly provided to) the chief operating decision maker and (2) included in the reported measure of segment
profit or loss. The new standard also allows companies to disclose multiple measures of segment profit or loss if those measures
are used to assess performance and allocate resources. The guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the
year ending December 31, 2024, and will be adopted retrospectively unless impracticable. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2023-07 on our disclosures. 

53 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information
about our effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The guidance will first be effective
in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2025, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option
to apply retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2023-09 on
our disclosures. 

In
March 2024, the SEC adopted new rules relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-change-related physical and transition
risks, data, and opportunities. The adopted rule contains several new disclosure obligations, including, (i) disclosure on how
the board of directors and management oversee climate-related risks and certain climate-related governance items, (ii) disclosure
of information related to a registrant s climate-related targets, goals, and/or transition plans, and (iii) disclosure on
whether and how climate-related events and transition activities impact line items above a threshold amount on a registrant s
consolidate financial statements, including the impact of the financial estimates and the assumptions used. This new rule will
first be effective in the Company s disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2027. The Company is in the process of
assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

In November 2024, the FASB issued
ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, to improve transparency
in financial reporting by requiring entities to present more detailed information about the nature of expenses included within the Income
Statement. The guidance will first be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2024-03
on our disclosures.

4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures. 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in our
periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
were effective as of September 30, 2024, as the material weakness described below has been remediated. 

Previously Reported Material Weakness
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In the 2024 Form 10-Q,
filed with the SEC on August 16, 2024, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of June 30, 2024. In the evaluation, we did not maintain an effective control environment over the internal control activities
to ensure the proper recognition and measurement related to the accounting for complex and non-routine transactions. We did not
have adequate supervision and review controls over the complex accounting related to the non-cash impairment of intangibles, non-cash
equity transactions and the recoverability of inventory. As a result, management review of asset impairment calculations did not
identify errors in the associated cash flow projections which led to an error in the conclusion of the initial impairment assessment. 
We also did not properly assess the realizability of inventory based upon the projections utilized and our assessment of an amendment
to existing warrants that were reclassified into equity in the same period did not include a quantitative evaluation of the potential
materiality of revaluation adjustments. 

In connection with
the material weakness as it relates to the accounting for complex and non-routine transactions related to the non-cash impairment
of intangibles, non-cash equity transactions and the recoverability of inventory, management re-evaluated the effectiveness of
such controls as of September 30, 2024, and concluded that such controls were operating effectively as of September 30, 2024. The
remediation of the material weakness over the complex accounting related to the non-cash impairment of intangibles, non-cash equity
transactions was as a result of no material balances related to these financial statement captions as of September 30, 2024, and
consequently there was no risk of material misstatements for these financial statement captions. In relation to the realizability
of inventory, the remediation of this material weakness constituted expanded review processes including but not limited to the
assessment of additional data points for the assessment and additional personnel included to evaluate our ability to realize inventory
balances.
