million to third-party investors for proceeds of million, before offering costs and accrued interest. The sold bonds are included in Non-recourse securitization obligations, collateralized by residential mortgage loans in securitization trusts on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as a result of the transactions described above, securitized loans with outstanding principal balance of approximately billion and billion are included in Residential mortgage loans in securitization trusts on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate carrying value of sold bonds issued by consolidated VIEs was billion and billion, respectively. These sold bonds are disclosed as Non-recourse securitization obligation, collateralized by residential mortgage loans in securitization trusts on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The holders of the securitized debt have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, but the Company does have the obligation, under certain circumstances, to repurchase assets from the VIE upon the breach of certain representations and warranties with respect to the residential whole loans sold to the VIE. In the absence of such a breach, the Company has no obligation to provide any other explicit or implicit support to any VIE. 
 
 The Company concluded that the entities created to facilitate the loan securitization transactions are VIEs. The Company completed an analysis of whether each VIE created to facilitate the securitization transactions should be consolidated by the Company, based on consideration of its involvement in each VIE and whether its involvement reflected a controlling financial interest that resulted in the Company being deemed the primary beneficiary of each VIE. In determining whether the Company would be considered the primary beneficiary, the following factors were assessed: 
 
 whether the Company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE; and 
 whether the Company has a right to receive benefits or absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE. 
 
 Based on its evaluation of the factors discussed above, including its involvement in the purpose and design of the entity, the Company determined that it was required to consolidate each VIE created to facilitate the loan securitization transactions. 
 
 VIEs for Which the Company is Not the Primary Beneficiary 
 
 The Company sponsored or participated along with other affiliates and entities managed by Angel Oak Capital in the formation of various entities that were considered to be VIEs. These VIEs were formed to facilitate securitization issuances that were comprised of secured residential whole loans and/or small balance commercial loans contributed to securitization trusts. 
 
 These securities were issued as a result of the unconsolidated securitizations where the Company retained bonds from the issuances of securitizations issued by a depositor that the Company does not control. The Company determined that it was not then and is not now the primary beneficiary of any of these securitization entities, and thus has not consolidated the operating results or statements of financial position of any of these entities. The Company performs ongoing reassessments of all VIEs in which the Company has participated since its inception as to whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company s involvement with a VIE would cause the Company s consolidation conclusion to change, and the Company s assessment of these VIEs remains unchanged. 
 
 The securities received in the securitization transactions for which we are not the primary beneficiary were classified as available for sale upon receipt and are included in RMBS - at fair value and Other Assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and details on the accounting treatment and fair value methodology of the securities can be found in Note 9 Fair Value Measurements .

 Senior Unsecured Notes

The Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing on October 30, 2024. The Notes will mature on July 30, 2029, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company and are held at amortized cost. After deducting the underwriting discount and other debt issuance costs, the Company received net proceeds of approximately million.

Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to a change of control of the Company, the Company must make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date . 
 
 The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Operating Partnership, including the due and punctual payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise.

 million and million, respectively. There was TBA margin collateral required as of either September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized income tax expense and a corresponding liability related to income from our TBAs. 
 
 The Company uses interest rate futures as economic hedges to hedge a portion of its interest rate risk exposure. Interest rate risk is sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors. The Company s credit risk with respect to economic hedges is the risk of default on its investments that result from a borrower s or counterparty s inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. 
 
 The Company may at times hold TBAs in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on certain specified mortgage-backed securities. Amounts or obligations owed by or to the Company are subject to the right of set-off with the TBA counterparty. As part of executing these trades, the Company may enter into agreements with its TBA counterparties that govern the transactions for the TBA purchases or sales made, including margin maintenance, payment and transfer, events of default, settlements, and various other provisions. 
 
 Changes in the value of derivatives designed to protect against mortgage-backed securities fair value fluctuations, or economic hedging gains and losses, are reflected in the tables below. All realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts are recognized in earnings, in net realized gain (loss) on mortgage loans, derivative contracts, RMBS, and CMBS for realized gains and losses, and net unrealized gain (loss) on trading securities, mortgage loans, portion of debt at fair value option, and derivative contracts for unrealized gains and losses. 
 
 The Company considers the notional amounts, categorized by primary underlying risk, to be representative of the volume of its derivative activities.

 We use third party valuation firms who utilize proprietary methodologies to value our residential and commercial loans. These firms generally use both market comparable information and discounted cash flow modeling techniques to determine the fair value of our Level 3 assets. Use of these techniques requires determination of relevant input and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs such as anticipated credit losses, prepayment rates, default rates, or other valuation assumptions. Accordingly, a significant increase or decrease in any of these inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement.

 Assets and Liabilities Held at Amortized Cost Fair Value Disclosure 
 
 Portion of Non-Recourse Securitization Obligations, Collateralized by Residential Mortgage Loans Held at Amortized Cost 
 
 To determine the fair value of the Company s non-recourse securitization obligations, collateralized by residential mortgage loans, net, held at amortized cost, the Company uses the same method of valuation as described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Note 10 Fair Value Measurements for both the portion of the obligation measured at fair value and the portion of the obligation held at amortized cost, for which fair value is disclosed below. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total amortized cost basis and fair value of our non-recourse securitization obligations was billion and billion, respectively, a difference of approximately million (which includes AOMT 2022-1, AOMT 2022-4, AOMT 2023-4, and AOMT 2024-4, which are marked to fair value; and AOMT 2021-4 and AOMT 2021-7, which are carried at amortized cost, as the fair value option was not elected at the time of the creation of these obligations). The difference between the amortized cost and fair value solely attributable to AOMT 2021-4 and 2021-7 is approximately million. The difference between the amortized cost basis value and the fair value is derived from the difference between the period-end market pricing of the underlying bonds, as referred to above, and the amortized cost of the obligation. The fair value of the non-recourse securitization debt is not indicative of the amounts at which we could settle this debt. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023, the total amortized cost basis and fair value of our non-recourse securitization obligations was billion and billion, respectively, a difference of approximately million (which includes AOMT 2022-1, AOMT 2022-4, and AOMT 2023-4, which are marked to fair value; and AOMT 2021-4 and AOMT 2021-7, which are carried at amortized cost, as the fair value option was not elected at the time of the creation of these obligations). The fair value solely attributable to AOMT 2021-4 and 2021-7 is approximately million less than the amortized cost. The difference between the amortized cost basis value and the fair value is derived from the difference between the period-end market pricing of the underlying bonds, as referred to above, and the amortized cost of the obligation. The fair value of the non-recourse securitization debt is not indicative of the amounts at which we could settle this debt. 
 
 Investments in Majority-Owned Affiliates 
 
 To determine the fair value of the Company s investments in majority-owned affiliates, which are held at amortized cost and included in other assets , the Company uses the prices of the underlying bonds in the investments to determine fair value. The Company utilizes PriceServe, Bank of America s independent fixed income pricing service, as the primary valuation source for these bonds. PriceServe obtains its price quotes from actual sales or quotes for sale of the same or similar securities and/or provides model based valuations that consider inputs derived from recent market activity including default rates, conditional prepayment rates, loss severity, expected yield to maturity, baseline discount margin/yield, recovery assumptions, tranche type, collateral coupon, age and loan size, and other inputs specific to each security. We believe that these quotes are most reflective of the price that would be achieved if the bonds were sold to an independent third party on the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The amortized cost and fair value of this investment as of September 30, 2024 was approximately million and million, respectively. The amortized cost and fair value of these investments as of December 31, 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively.

 Important Information Regarding Our Disclosure to Investors 
 
 We may use our website (www.angeloakreit.com) to communicate with our investors and disclose company information.

General 
 
 Angel Oak Mortgage REIT, Inc. is a real estate finance company focused on acquiring and investing in first lien non-QM loans and other mortgage-related assets in the U.S. mortgage market. Our strategy is to make credit-sensitive investments primarily in newly-originated first lien non-QM loans that are primarily made to higher-quality non-QM loan borrowers and primarily sourced from Angel Oak s proprietary mortgage lending platform, Angel Oak Mortgage Lending, which currently operates primarily through a wholesale channel and has a national origination footprint. We also may invest in other residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS ), and other mortgage-related assets, which, collectively with non-QM loans, we refer to as our target assets. Further, we also may identify and acquire our target assets through the secondary market when market conditions and asset prices are conducive to making attractive purchases. Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, through cash distributions and capital appreciation, across interest rate and credit cycles. 
 We are externally managed and advised by our Manager, Falcons I, LLC, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and an affiliate of Angel Oak Capital, a leading alternative credit manager with market leadership in mortgage credit that includes asset management, lending and capital markets. Angel Oak Mortgage Lending, an affiliated Angel Oak mortgage origination platform, is a market leader in non QM loan production. 
 
 Through our relationship with our Manager, we benefit from Angel Oak s vertically integrated platform and in house expertise, providing us with the resources that we believe are necessary to generate attractive risk adjusted returns for our stockholders. Angel Oak Mortgage Lending provides us with proprietary access to non QM loans, as well as transparency over the underwriting process and the ability to acquire loans with our desired credit and return profile. We believe our ability to identify and acquire target assets through the secondary market is bolstered by Angel Oak s experience in the mortgage industry and expertise in structured credit investments. In addition, we believe we have significant competitive advantages due to Angel Oak s analytical investment tools, extensive relationships in the financial community, financing and capital structuring skills, investment surveillance capabilities, and operational expertise. 
 26 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019. Commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019, we believe that we have been organized and operated, and we intend to continue to operate in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Our qualification as a REIT, and maintenance of such qualification, depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels, and the concentration of ownership of our stock. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will allow us to maintain our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Our common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 17, 2021. 
 
 We expect to derive our returns primarily from the difference between the interest we earn on loans we invest in and our cost of capital, as well as the returns from bonds, including risk retention securities, that are retained after securitizing the underlying loan collateral. 

Trends and Recent Developments 
 
 Overall macroeconomic environment and its effect on us 
 
 Over the course of the third quarter, signs of easing inflation and a stable employment sector that had emerged during the second quarter persisted, providing the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States the Fed with confidence to reduce interest rates at its September meeting for the first time since March of 2020. At that meeting, the Fed elected to reduce rates by what was perceived to be an aggressive 50 basis points bps ). Following the rate cut and now that an easing rate cycle has begun, analysts are split over the expected timing and extent of future rate cuts. As of the end of September 2024, markets were pricing in an additional 1.5 cuts through the end of the year. As of the end of September 2024, inflation was 2.4 , down from 2.9 as of the end of June but still above the Fed s 2.0 target. 
 
 30 year fixed residential conforming mortgage rates also responded to the Fed rate cuts, with the average rate dropping 78bps, from from 6.86 at the end of June 2024 to 6.08 as of the end of September 2024. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, mortgage origination activity rose 9.6 in August 2024 on a month over month seasonally adjusted basis, driven by a 15.8 increase in single-family housing starts. Rate cuts are expected to drive increased home purchase and mortgage origination activity going forward, but the extent of such activity remains uncertain. 
 On the heels of inflation data and the Fed rate cuts, the two-year and five-year Treasury yields decreased by 112bps and 82bps, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the end of June 2024. Net of new loan purchases and securitizations, we observed an increase of approximately 261 basis points in the weighted average price of our residential whole loans portfolio since the end of second quarter 2024. The weighted average coupon of our residential whole loans portfolio held relatively flat at 7.73 as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared to 7.71 as of the end of the second quarter of 2024. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024, in October, we executed the AOMT 2024-10 securitization as the sole contributor of loans, contributing approximately 316.8 million in scheduled unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans. During the third quarter of 2024, we purchased 264.8 million of newly-originated, current market coupon non-QM residential mortgage loans, with a weighted average coupon of 7.74 , weighted average loan-to-value ratio LTV of 70.0 and weighted average credit score of 754. 
 
 Notes offering 
 
 On July 25, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering and sale of, and issued, 50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9.500 Senior Notes due 2029 (the Notes ). The Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.500 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing on October 30, 2024. The Notes will mature on July 30, 2029, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us. We have deployed the majority of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of non-QM loans and other target assets primarily sourced from our affiliated proprietary mortgage lending platform and other target assets through the secondary market in a manner consistent with our strategy and investment guidelines. Additionally, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repurchase 1,707,922 shares of our common stock owned by Xylem Finance LLC, an affiliate of Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately 20.0 million. 
 
 Our investment performance 
 
 Net Interest Margin NIM ). An increase in both the balance and yield of our target assets generated greater interest income in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. Interest income growth outpaced the growth in interest expense, leading to higher NIM in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net realized loss . Our net realized loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to realized losses associated with rate hedge contracts, as well as paydowns on our residential loans and loans held in securitization trusts portfolios. 
 
 Net unrealized gain . Our net unrealized gain for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in the valuation of our residential whole loans and the net valuation of loans in securitization trust and non-recourse securitization obligation portfolios. 
 
 27 

Whole loans and securitization activity 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 264.8 million of newly-originated, current market coupon non-QM residential mortgage loans, with a weighted average coupon of 7.74 , weighted average LTV of 70.0 and weighted average credit score of 754. 
 
 In March 2024, we participated in AOMT 2024-3, an approximately 439.6 million scheduled unpaid principal balance securitization backed by a pool of residential mortgage loans, to which we contributed loans with a scheduled unpaid principal balance of approximately 48.7 million. We participated in this securitization alongside other Angel Oak entities, and may strategically enter into similar securitizations in the future. 
 
 In April 2024, we issued AOMT 2024-4, an approximately 299.8 million scheduled unpaid principal balance securitization backed by a pool of residential mortgage loans. We issued AOMT 2024-4 as the sole participant in the securitization. As the primary beneficiary we have consolidated the AOMT 2024-4 securitization, maintaining the residential mortgage loans held in the securitization trust and the related financing obligation thereto on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the applicable balance sheet date. 
 
 In June 2024, we participated in AOMT 2024-6, an approximately 479.6 million scheduled unpaid principal balance securitization backed by a pool of residential mortgage loans, to which we contributed loans with a scheduled unpaid principal balance of approximately 22.9 million. We participated in this securitization alongside other Angel Oak entities, and may strategically enter into similar securitizations in the future. 
 
 Subsequent to quarter end, in October 2024, we issued AOMT 2024-10, an approximately 316.8 million scheduled unpaid principal balance securitization backed by a pool of residential mortgage loans. We issued AOMT 2024-10 as the sole participant in the securitization. As the primary beneficiary we will consolidate the AOMT 2024-10 securitization, maintaining the residential mortgage loans held in the securitization trust and the related financing obligation thereto on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the applicable balance sheet date. 
 
 Whole loan financing facilities activity 
 
 We continuously evaluate our lender base and may enter into new agreements and / or exit agreements as we deem prudent, in accordance with our core financial strategy of purchasing whole loans and financing them until securitized. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a full description of our financing arrangements. Our total borrowing capacity was 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024. Highlights of whole loan financing facilities activity over the third quarter of 2024 are as follows: 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we maintained the same whole loan financing facility lender base as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we (i) renewed our loan financing facility with Multinational Bank 1 in accordance with the mechanism for six-month renewal periods. 
 
 Subsequent to quarter end, we (i) in October 2024, amended our loan financing facility with Global Investment Bank 2 to, among other changes, reduce the interest rate pricing spread to a range from 1.75 to 3.35 and (ii) in November 2024 amended our loan financing facility with Global Investment Bank 3 to, among other changes, (a) extend the termination date to November 1, 2025; (b) reduce the interest rate pricing spread to a range from1.90 to 4.75 based on collateral type, loan status, dwell time and other factors; and (c) eliminate the 20 basis point index spread adjustment. 

Key Financial Metrics 
 
 As a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are Distributable Earnings, Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity, Book Value per Share of Common Stock, and Economic Book Value per Share of Common Stock. 
 
 Distributable Earnings 
 
 Distributable Earnings is a non GAAP measure and is defined as net income (loss) allocable to common stockholders as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), excluding (1) unrealized gains and losses on our aggregate portfolio, (2) impairment losses, (3) extinguishment of debt, (4) non-cash equity compensation expense, (5) the incentive fee earned by our Manager, (6) realized gains or losses on swap terminations and (7) certain other nonrecurring gains or losses. We believe that the presentation of Distributable Earnings provides investors with a useful measure to facilitate comparisons of financial performance among our REIT peers, but has important limitations. We believe Distributable Earnings as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions but is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. As a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable income and to pay U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100 of such taxable income. Given these requirements and our belief that dividends are generally one of the principal reasons that stockholders invest in our common stock, generally we intend to attempt to pay dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our REIT taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our Board of Directors. Distributable Earnings is one of a 
 28 

number of factors considered by our Board of Directors in declaring dividends and, while not a direct measure of REIT taxable income, over time, the measure can be considered a useful indicator of our dividends. Distributable Earnings should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income computed in accordance with GAAP. Our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our Distributable Earnings may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs. 
 
 We also use Distributable Earnings to determine the incentive fee, if any, payable to our Manager pursuant to the management agreement that we and the Operating Partnership entered into with our Manager upon the completion of our initial public offering of common stock IPO on June 21, 2021 and amended and restated on May 1, 2024 (as amended and restated, the Management Agreement ). For information on the fees that are payable to our Manager under the Management Agreement, see Note 10 Related Party Transactions in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 Distributable Earnings were a loss of 3.4 million and a loss of 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary drivers of this quarter s Distributable Earnings as compared to GAAP net income are the adjustments to remove unrealized gains associated with our residential loans and residential loans in securitization trusts and non-recourse securitization obligation portfolios. 
 
 The table below sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) allocable to common stockholders, calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Distributable Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Net income (loss) allocable to common stockholders 31,204 8,273 43,806 5,115 Adjustments: Net unrealized (gains) losses on trading securities (984) 4,857 829 7,134 Net unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives 51 (4,563) (2,985) 7,794 Net unrealized (gains) losses on residential loans in securitization trusts and non-recourse securitization obligation (26,304) (5,319) (28,871) 5,784 Net unrealized (gains) losses on residential loans (7,935) (12,338) (17,438) (48,497) Net unrealized (gains) losses on commercial loans 64 (49) (83) Non-cash equity compensation expense 604 447 1,864 1,195 Distributable Earnings (3,364) (8,579) (2,844) (21,558) 
 
 Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity 
 
 Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as annual or annualized Distributable Earnings divided by average total stockholders equity. We believe that the presentation of Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity provides investors with a useful measure to facilitate comparisons of financial performance among our REIT peers, but has important limitations. Additionally, we believe Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity provides investors with additional detail on the Distributable Earnings generated by our invested equity capital. We believe Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity as described above helps evaluate our financial performance without the impact of certain transactions but is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool. Therefore, Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for net income computed in accordance with GAAP. Our methodology for calculating Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs. Set forth below is our computation of Distributable Earnings Return on Average Equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Book Value per Share of Common Stock 
 
 The following table sets forth the calculation of our book value per share of common stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Economic Book Value per Share of Common Stock 
 
 Economic book value is a non-GAAP financial measure of our financial position. To calculate our economic book value, the portions of our non-recourse financing obligation held at amortized cost are adjusted to fair value. These adjustments are also reflected in the table below in our end of period total stockholders equity. Management considers economic book value to provide investors with a useful supplemental measure to evaluate our financial position as it reflects the impact of fair value changes for our legally held retained bonds, irrespective of the accounting model applied for GAAP reporting purposes. Economic book value does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for book value per share of common stock or stockholders equity, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and our calculation of this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation from GAAP total stockholders equity and book value per share of common stock to economic book value and economic book value per share of common stock as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Net Interest Income 
 
 The following table sets forth the components of net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Interest income Interest income / expense Average balance Interest income / expense Average balance Residential mortgage loans 4,659 263,095 4,272 289,916 Residential mortgage loans in securitization trusts 18,580 1,454,736 15,208 1,228,074 Commercial mortgage loans 81 5,246 58 6,329 RMBS and Majority-Owned Affiliate 3,251 117,965 3,067 171,128 CMBS 417 6,239 147 6,453 U.S. Treasury securities 65 6,000 541 46,607 Other interest income 391 40,919 607 42,669 Total interest income 27,444 23,900 Interest expense Notes payable 2,830 176,159 4,117 205,915 Non-recourse securitization obligation, collateralized by residential mortgage loans 13,731 1,362,039 10,956 1,191,406 Repurchase facilities 900 57,842 1,417 87,279 Senior unsecured notes 
 963 40,538 Total interest expense 18,424 16,490 Net interest income 9,020 7,410 
 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 9.0 million and 7.4 million, respectively. Net interest income increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher net interest income from our residential mortgage loans portfolio (residential mortgage loan interest income less notes payable interest expense) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 . We observed net interest income associated with our residential mortgage loan portfolio of 1.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.1 million in the comparable period of 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase in the weighted average coupon rate of our residential mortgage loans portfolio versus the comparative period, as well as holding more unlevered loans, resulting in a proportionally lower notes payable balance.

Total Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 
 The components of total realized and unrealized gains (losses), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are set forth as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on securitization, net of unrealized gain (loss) on non-recourse securitization obligation 25,228 4,352 Realized gain (loss) on RMBS (565) (598) Unrealized gain (loss) on Whole Pool Agency RMBS (2,138) (12,367) Realized gain (loss) on CMBS (67) (101) Realized gain (loss) on interest rate futures (4,461) 2,828 Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on TBAs 1,880 12,349 Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on residential mortgage loans 7,789 (856) Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on commercial mortgage loans (35) Realized and unrealized loss on U.S. Treasury securities (13) 47 Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on interest rate futures 1,184 (364) Total realized and unrealized gains (losses), net 28,837 5,255 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total realized and unrealized gains (losses), net resulted in gains of 28.8 million and 5.3 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, gains on securitization, net of unrealized gain (loss) on non-recourse securitization obligation drove the majority of the overall gain to our portfolio as valuations increased during the quarter. Similarly, during the three months ended September 30, 2023 gains on securitization, net of unrealized gain (loss) on non-recourse securitization obligation drove the majority of the overall gain to our portfolio as well. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses were 1.3 million and 1.4 million, respectively. Our operating expenses decreased slightly compared to the comparative period due to continued cost savings actions such as in-sourcing of key accounting functions, vendor contract negotiations, and a decrease in servicing fees associated with servicing our whole loan portfolio. 
 
 Operating Expenses Incurred with Affiliate 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses incurred with affiliate were 0.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively. These expenses, which are substantially comprised of payroll reimbursements to our Manager, decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 as a result of additional cost savings actions. 
 
 Due Diligence and Transaction Costs 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our due diligence and transaction costs were 254 thousand and 115 thousand, respectively. Our due diligence and transaction expenses increased over the comparative period due to increased purchases of whole loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Stock Compensation 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our stock compensation expense was 0.6 million and 0.4 million, respectively. Our stock compensation expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in the estimated impact for outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit awards. 
 
 Securitization Costs 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 0.0 million and 0.4 million of securitization costs, respectively. There was no securitization activity in the third quarter of 2024, and the securitization costs in the comparative period in 2023 were driven by our participation in the AOMT 2023-5 securitization. 
 
 33 

Management Fee Incurred with Affiliate 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our management fee incurred with affiliate was 1.2 million and 1.4 million, respectively. The decrease is due to the decrease in our average Equity as defined in the Management Agreement for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. A key driver of the decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparative period of 2023 is the repurchase of 1,707,922 million shares of our common stock owned by Xylem Finance, LLC, an affiliate of Davidson Kempner Capital Management, LP, for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately 20 million. The calculation of Equity for the purposes of the Management Agreement includes the addition of Distributable Earnings, which is the primary departure from the calculation of equity in accordance with GAAP.

 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 27.1 million and 20.7 million, respectively. Net interest income increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher net interest income from our residential mortgage loans portfolio (residential mortgage loan interest income less notes payable interest expense) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We observed net interest income associated with our residential mortgage loan portfolio of 4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of (2.8) million in the comparable period of 2023. This was primarily driven by an increase in the weighted average coupon rate of our residential mortgage loans portfolio versus the comparative period, as well as holding more unlevered loans, resulting in a proportionally lower notes payable balance.

Total Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 
 The components of total realized and unrealized gains (losses), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are set forth as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (in thousands) Realized and unrealized gain (loss) on securitization, net of unrealized gain (loss) on non-recourse securitization obligation

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total realized and unrealized gains (losses), net resulted in a net gain of 34 million and a loss of 0.8 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gains on residential mortgage loans in securitization trust, net of unrealized gain (loss) on non-recourse securitization obligation, residential mortgage loans, TBAs, and interest rate futures were offset by losses on RMBS and whole pool agency RMBS. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, market volatility caused the valuation of our residential mortgage loans in securitization trust and whole pool agency RMBS to decrease, which was offset by gains in our residential mortgage loans portfolio and interest rate futures. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses were 4.6 million and 5.8 million, respectively. Our operating expenses decreased during the comparative period due to continued cost savings actions such as in-sourcing of key accounting functions, vendor contract negotiations, and a decrease in servicing fees associated with servicing our whole loan portfolio. 
 
 Operating Expenses Incurred with Affiliate 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating expenses incurred with affiliate were 1.44 million and 1.7 million, respectively. These expenses, which are substantially comprised of payroll reimbursements to our Manager, decreased versus the comparative period as a result of additional cost savings actions. 
 
 Due Diligence and Transaction Costs 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our due diligence and transaction costs were 663 thousand and 136 thousand, respectively. Our due diligence and transaction expenses increased versus the comparative period as we purchased more whole loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 than the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Stock Compensation 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 our stock compensation expense was 1.9 million and 1.2 million, respectively. Stock compensation expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in the estimated impact for outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit awards. 

36 

Securitization Costs 
 
 Securitization costs of 1.6 million were incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the AOMT 2024-3, AOMT 2024-4, and AOMT 2024-6 securitization transactions. There were 2.3 million of securitization costs incurred for the comparable period in 2023, representing costs incurred in connection with the AOMT 2023-1, AOMT 2023-4, and AOMT 2023-5 securitizations. 
 
 Management Fee Incurred with Affiliate 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our management fee incurred with affiliate was 3.8 million and 4.5 million, respectively. The decrease is due to the decrease in our average Equity as defined in the Management Agreement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. A key driver of the decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparative period of 2023 is the repurchase of 1,707,922 million shares of our common stock owned by Xylem Finance, LLC, an affiliate of Davidson Kempner Capital Management, LP, for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately 20 million. The calculation of Equity for the purposes of the Management Agreement includes the addition of Distributable Earnings, which is the primary departure from the calculation of equity in accordance with GAAP.

Our Portfolio 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of approximately 2.2 billion of residential mortgage loans, RMBS, and other target assets. Certain of these portfolio assets are located in states such as Florida and California where natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes may occasionally occur. We require all of our collateral to be adequately insured.

RMBS 
 We have participated in numerous securitization transactions pursuant to which we contributed to a securitization trust under the purview of AOMT I, LLC, non QM loans that we had accumulated and held on our balance sheet. These loans were purchased from affiliated and unaffiliated entities. In return, we received bonds from these securitization trusts, and cash. At times, we were allocated certain risk retention securities as part of these transactions. Risk retention securities represent at least 5 of a horizontal or vertical slice of the bonds issued as part of the transaction.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund our investments and operating costs, make distributions to our stockholders, and satisfy other general business needs. Our financing sources currently include payments of principal and interest we receive on our investment portfolio, unused borrowing capacity under our in place loan financing lines and repurchase facilities, securitizations of our whole loans, and our ATM Program (as defined below). Additionally, on July 25, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering and sale of, and issued, 50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9.500 Senior Notes due 2029. We have deployed the majority of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which included the acquisition of non-QM loans and other target assets primarily sourced from our affiliated proprietary mortgage lending platform and other target assets through the secondary market in a manner consistent with our strategy and investment guidelines. Additionally, we used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repurchase 1,707,922 shares of our common stock owned by Xylem Finance LLC, an affiliate of Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, for an aggregate repurchase price of approximately 20.0 million. See Trends and Recent Developments Notes offering in this report. Our financing sources historically have included the foregoing, as well as capital contributions from our investors prior to our IPO, and the proceeds from our IPO and concurrent private placement (which capital has all been deployed). Going forward, we may also utilize other types of borrowings, including bank credit facilities and warehouse lines of credit, among others. We may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of equity, equity-related, or debt securities, depending upon market conditions. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions, availability of these sources, and the investment opportunities available to us. 
 We have used and expect to continue to use loan financing lines to finance the acquisition and accumulation of mortgage loans or other mortgage related assets pending their eventual securitization. Upon accumulating an appropriate amount of assets, we have financed and expect to continue to finance a substantial portion of our mortgage loans utilizing fixed-rate term securitization funding that provides long term financing for our mortgage loans and locks in our cost of funding, regardless of future interest rate movements. 
 
 Securitizations may either take the form of the issuance of securitized bonds or the sale of real estate mortgage investment conduit securities backed by mortgage loans or other assets, with the securitization proceeds being used in part to repay pre-existing loan financing lines and repurchase facilities. We have sponsored and participated in securitization transactions with other entities that are managed by Angel Oak, and may continue to do so in the future, along with sponsoring sole securitization transactions. 
 
 We believe these identified sources of financing will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term (within one year) and our longer term liquidity needs. We cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and any potential changes in market conditions.

Description of Existing Financing Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were a party to three warehouse loan financing lines, which permitted borrowings in an aggregate amount of up to 1.1 billion. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we renewed our loan financing facility with Multinational Bank 1 in accordance with the mechanism for six-month renewal periods. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we (i) amended our loan financing facility with Global Investment Bank 2 to, among other changes, reduce the interest rate pricing spread to a range from 1.75 to 3.35 and (ii) amended our loan financing facility with Global Investment Bank 3 to, among other changes, extend the termination date to (a) November 1, 2025; (b) reduce the interest rate pricing spread to a range from 1.90 to 4.75 based on collateral type, loan status, dwell time and other factors; and (c) eliminate the 20 basis point index spread adjustment. Borrowings under warehouse loan financing lines (in general, each a loan financing facility may be used to purchase whole loans for securitization or loans purchased for long term investment purposes. 
 Our financing facilities are generally subject to limits on borrowings related to specific asset pools advance rates and other restrictive covenants, as is usual and customary. As of September 30, 2024, the advance rates (when required) of our three active lenders ranged from 65 to 92 , depending on the asset type and loan delinquency status. Our most restrictive covenants (when covenants are required by any of our three active lenders) included (1) our minimum tangible net worth must not (i) decline 20 or more in the previous 30 days, 25 or more in the previous 90 days, or 35 or more in the previous year, or (ii) fall below 200.0 million of tangible net worth as of September 30, 2022 plus 50 of any capital contribution made or raised after September 30, 2022; (2) our minimum liquidity must not fall below the greatest of (i) the product of 5 and the aggregate repurchase price for a specific loan financing facility as of such date of determination, (ii) 10.0 million and (iii) any other amount of liquidity that we have covenanted to maintain in any other note, indenture, loan agreement, guaranty, swap agreement or any other contract, agreement or transaction (including, without limitation, any repurchase agreement, loan and security agreement, or similar credit facility or agreement for borrowed funds); and (3) the maximum ratio of our and our subsidiaries total indebtedness to tangible net worth must not be greater than 5:1. Our minimum liquidity requirement as of September 30, 2024 was 10.0 million. 
 A description of each loan financing facility in place during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 is set forth as follows: 
 Multinational Bank 1 Loan Financing Facility. On April 13, 2022, we and two of our subsidiaries entered into a master repurchase agreement with a multinational bank Multinational Bank 1 ). Our subsidiaries are each considered a Seller under this agreement. From time to time and pursuant to the agreement, either of our subsidiaries may sell to Multinational Bank 1, and later repurchase, up to 600.0 million aggregate borrowings on mortgage loans. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the master repurchase agreement, the agreement may be renewed every three months for a maximum six-month term. As of September 30, 2024, the termination date of the master repurchase agreement was March 25, 2025. 
 The amount expected to be paid by Multinational Bank 1 for each eligible mortgage loan is based on an advance rate as a percentage of either the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan or the market value of the mortgage loan, whichever is less. Pursuant to the agreement, Multinational Bank 1 retains the right to determine the market value of the mortgage loans in its sole commercially reasonable discretion. The loan financing line is marked to market. Additionally, Multinational Bank 1 is under no obligation to purchase the eligible mortgage loans we offer to sell to them. The interest rate on any outstanding balance under the master repurchase agreement that the applicable subsidiary is required to pay Multinational Bank 1 is generally in line with other similar agreements that the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries has entered into, where the interest rate is equal to the sum of (1) a pricing spread generally ranging from 1.75 to 2.10 and (2) the average SOFR for each U.S. Government Securities Business Day (as defined in the master repurchase agreement) until two U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the date the applicable loan is repurchased by the applicable subsidiary. 
 The obligations of the subsidiaries under the master repurchase agreement are guaranteed by the Company pursuant to a guaranty executed contemporaneously with the master repurchase agreement. In addition, and similar to other repurchase agreements that the Company has entered into, the Company is subject to various financial and other covenants, including those relating to (1) maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth; (2) a maximum ratio of indebtedness to tangible net worth; and (3) minimum liquidity. 
 The agreement contains margin call provisions that provide Multinational Bank 1 with certain rights in the event of a decline in the market value of the purchased mortgage loans. Under these provisions, Multinational Bank 1 may require us or our subsidiaries to transfer cash sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit resulting from such a decline. 
 In addition, the agreement contains events of default (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods), including payment defaults, breaches of covenants and/or certain representations and warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and other events of default customary for this type of transaction. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction and include the acceleration of the principal amount outstanding under the agreement and Multinational Bank 1 s right to liquidate the mortgage loans then subject to the agreement. 
 We and our subsidiaries are also required to pay certain customary fees to Multinational Bank 1 and to reimburse Multinational Bank 1 for certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with its structuring, management, and ongoing administration of the master repurchase agreement. 
 Global Investment Bank 2 Loan Financing Facility. On March 28, 2024, two of our subsidiaries entered into a master repurchase agreement with a global investment bank Global Investment Bank 2 ), replacing the existing master repurchase agreement with Global 
 53 

Investment Bank 2 entered into on February 13, 2020. Our two subsidiaries are each considered a Seller under this agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, one of our subsidiaries may sell to Global Investment Bank 2, and later repurchase, up to 250.0 million aggregate borrowings on mortgage loans. The agreement is set to terminate on March 27, 2026, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the agreement. 
 The principal amount paid by Global Investment Bank 2 for each mortgage loan is based on a percentage of the market value, cost basis value, or unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan (depending on the type of loan and certain other factors and subject to certain other adjustments). Pursuant to the agreement, Global Investment Bank 2 retains the right to determine the market value of the mortgage loan collateral in its sole good faith discretion. Additionally, Global Investment Bank 2 is under no obligation to purchase the eligible mortgage loans we offer to sell to them. Upon our or our subsidiary s repurchase of the mortgage loan, our subsidiaries are required to repay Global Investment Bank 2 the principal amount related to such mortgage loan plus accrued and unpaid interest at a rate based on the sum of (1) the greater of (A) the greater of (i) 0.00 and (ii) Term SOFR (which is defined as the forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate for a corresponding tenor of one month) and (B) a pricing spread generally ranging from, as of October 25, 2024, 1.75 to 3.35 . 
 The obligations of the subsidiaries under the master repurchase agreement are guaranteed by the Company pursuant to a guaranty executed contemporaneously with the master repurchase agreement. In addition, and similar to other repurchase agreements that the Company has entered into, the Company is subject to various financial and other covenants, including those relating to (1) maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth; (2) a maximum ratio of indebtedness to tangible net worth; and (3) minimum liquidity. 
 The agreement contains margin call provisions that provide Global Investment Bank 2 with certain rights in the event of a decline in the market value or cost basis value of the purchased mortgage loans. Under these provisions, Global Investment Bank 2 may require us or our subsidiary to transfer cash sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit resulting from such a decline. 
 In addition, the agreement contains events of default (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods), including payment defaults, breaches of covenants and/or certain representations and warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and other events of default customary for this type of transaction. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction and include the acceleration of the principal amount outstanding under the agreement and Global Investment Bank 2 s right to liquidate the mortgage loans then subject to the agreement. 
 We and our subsidiary are also required to pay certain customary fees to Global Investment Bank 2 and to reimburse Global Investment Bank 2 for certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with its structuring, management and ongoing administration of the agreement. 
 Global Investment Bank 3 Loan Financing Facility. On October 24, 2018, two of our subsidiaries entered into a master repurchase agreement with a global investment bank Global Investment Bank 3 for which we serve as guarantor of our subsidiaries obligations. Our subsidiaries are each considered a Seller under this agreement. Pursuant to the initial agreement, our subsidiaries could sell to Global Investment Bank 3, and later repurchase, up to 200.0 million aggregate borrowings on mortgage loans, although Global Investment Bank 3 was under no obligation to purchase the loans our subsidiaries offered to sell to them. 
 On January 1, 2022, the facility was amended to transition the reference rate from a LIBOR-based index to Compound SOFR. Compound SOFR is determined on a one-month basis and is defined as a daily rate as determined by Global Investment Bank 3 to be the USD-SOFR-Compound rate as defined in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. definitions. 
 On November 7, 2023, the facility s termination date was extended to November 7, 2024. In addition, the base interest rate spread was reduced to 1.80 plus a 0.20 index spread adjustment. The advance rate for performing non-seasoned loans was increased to 85 . 
 On November 1, 2024, the facility s termination date was extended to November 1, 2025. In addition, the base interest rate spread was reduced to a range from 1.90 to 4.75 and the index spread adjustment of 0.20 was eliminated. 
 The loan financing line is marked-to-market at fair value, where Global Investment Bank 3 retains the right to determine the market value of the mortgage loan collateral in its sole and good faith discretion and in a commercially reasonable manner and is under no obligation to purchase the eligible mortgage loans we offered to sell to them. Further, the principal amount paid by Global Investment Bank 3 for each eligible mortgage loan is based on a percentage of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan or the market value of the mortgage loan, whichever is less. 
 The Agreement contains margin call provisions that provide Global Investment Bank 3 with certain rights in the event of a decline in the market value of the purchased mortgage loans. Under those provisions, Global Investment Bank 3 could require us or our subsidiaries to transfer cash sufficient to eliminate any margin deficit resulting from such a decline. 
 The agreement requires us to maintain various financial and other customary covenants. The agreement also sets forth events of default (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods), including payment defaults, breaches of covenants and/or certain representations and warranties, cross defaults, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and other events of default customary for this type of transaction. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction and include the acceleration of the principal amount outstanding under the agreement and Global Investment Bank 3 s right to liquidate the mortgage loans then subject to the agreement.

We and our subsidiaries are also required to pay certain customary fees to Global Investment Bank 3 and to reimburse Global Investment Bank 3 for certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with its structuring, management, and ongoing administration of the agreement. 
 Institutional Investors A and B Static Loan Pool Financing. On October 4, 2022, the Company and a subsidiary entered into two separate master repurchase facilities with two affiliates of an institutional investor Institutional Investors A and B regarding a specific pool of whole loans with financing of approximately 168.7 million on approximately 239.3 million of unpaid principal balance. The Company repaid these financing facilities in full on January 4, 2023, at which time the facilities were terminated pursuant to their terms. 
 Regional Bank 1 Loan Financing Facility. On December 21, 2018, we and one of our subsidiaries entered into a master repurchase agreement with a regional bank Regional Bank 1 ). This financing facility was substantially unused, and expired by its terms on March 16, 2023.

 We utilize short term repurchase facilities on our RMBS portfolio and to finance assets for REIT asset test purposes. Over time, the need to purchase securities for REIT asset test purposes will be reduced as we obtain and participate in additional securitizations and acquire assets directly for investment purposes. We will continue to use repurchase facilities on our RMBS portfolio to add additional leverage which increases the yield on those assets. Our use of repurchase facilities is generally highest at the end of any particular quarter, as shown in the table above, where the quarter-end balance and the highest month-end balance in each quarter are generally equivalent. 
 Securitization Transactions 
 Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October 2024, we were the sole participant in a securitization transaction of a pool of residential mortgage loans, secured exclusively by first liens on one to four family residential properties.

We used the proceeds of the securitization transaction to repay outstanding debt of approximately 260.4 million and retained cash of 39.4 million, which was used for new loan purchases and operational purposes. 
 We are the sole member of the Depositor and also own and hold the call rights on the XS tranche of bonds, which is the controlling class of the bonds. We will consolidate the AOMT 2024-10 securitization on our consolidated balance sheet, maintaining the residential mortgage loans held in the securitization trust and the related financing obligation thereto on our consolidated balance sheets in future reporting periods.

We finance our assets with what we believe to be a prudent amount of leverage, which will vary from time to time based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio, availability of financing, and market conditions. 
 Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and maintaining our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we expect to utilize various derivative instruments and other hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risk, credit risk and other risks. For example, we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to interest rate exposure on one or more of our assets or liabilities. Any such hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, index swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, and options. 
 Notes Offering 
 
 On July 25, 2024, we closed an underwritten public offering and sale of, and issued, 50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9.500 Senior Notes due 2029. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.500 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing on October 30, 2024. The Notes will mature on July 30, 2029, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Operating Partnership, including the due and punctual payment of principal of premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, whether at the stated maturity, upon, acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise. We may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after July 30, 2026 at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to a change of control of us, we must make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal to 101 of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 73 million of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ATM Program and Sales Agreement. 
 
 Cash Availability 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 
 Our cash balance as of September 30, 2024 was sufficient to meet our liquidity covenants under our financing facilities. We believe that we maintain sufficient cash to fund margin calls on our mark to market financing facilities or our economic hedge agreements, should such margin calls occur. 
 
 We may also participate in upcoming securitizations either solely or with other Angel Oak entities. We also have the ability to leverage currently unleveraged securities or whole loan assets, if we deem those actions advisable. 
 
 Restricted Cash 
 
 Restricted cash of approximately 2.7 million as of September 30, 2024 was comprised of: no margin collateral held in support of our whole pool assets; 2.3 million in interest rate futures margin collateral for the interest rate futures under our sole control; and margin collateral for securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 0.3 million.

 Cash Flows - Residential and Commercial Loan Classification 
 
 Residential loan activity is recognized in the statement of cash flows as an operating activity, as our residential mortgage loans are generally held for a short period of time with the intent to securitize these loans. Commercial mortgage loan activity is recognized in the statement of cash flows as an investing activity, as our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is generally deemed to be held for investing purposes. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is included in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not materially changed since December 31, 2023. Management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 
 We expect quarter-to-quarter GAAP earnings volatility from our business activities. This volatility can occur for a variety of reasons, particularly changes in the fair values of consolidated assets and liabilities. In addition, the amount or timing of our reported earnings may be impacted by technical accounting issues and estimates.
