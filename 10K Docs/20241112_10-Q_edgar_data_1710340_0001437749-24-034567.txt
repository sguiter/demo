as of September 30, 2024 in addition to revenues from products will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing of this quarterly report. This estimate is based on the Company s current assumptions, including assumptions relating to estimated sales and its ability to manage spending. The Company could use its available capital resources sooner than currently expected. Accordingly, the Company could seek to obtain additional capital through equity financings, the issuance of debt or other arrangements. However, the Company cannot make assurances that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or under acceptable terms. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing stockholders, and newly issued stock could contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding common shares. The Company s existing debt obligation contains covenants and limits the Company s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. If the Company experiences delays in product development or sales growth, obtaining regulatory approval for its other product candidates, or is unable to secure such additional financing, it might need to scale back operations. 

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The Company considers historical collection rates and the current financial status of its customers, as well as information from internal and external sources, macroeconomic and industry-specific factors, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when evaluating potential credit losses. Historically, the Company's accounts receivable balances have been highly concentrated with a select number of customers, consisting primarily of specialty pharmacies and large wholesale pharmaceutical distributors. Given the size and creditworthiness of these customers, we have not experienced and do not expect to experience material credit losses. 
 
 Inventories 
 
 The Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first -in, first -out method of valuation. The Company reviews its inventories for potential excess or obsolete issues on an ongoing basis and will record a write-down if an impairment is identified. Inventories at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , consist solely of purchased finished goods. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , inventories are shown net of reserves for ALKINDI SPRINKLE of and , respectively, due to the risk of expiry before this entire stock of inventories is sold. 

Property and Equipment 
 
 Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed utilizing the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives: computer hardware and software is depreciated over three years; equipment, furniture and fixtures is depreciated over five years; and leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter. 
 
 Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while renewals and improvements are capitalized. 
 
 Intangible Assets 
 
 The Company capitalizes payments it makes for licensed products when the payment relates to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA )-approved product, and the cost is recoverable based on expected future cash flows from the product. The cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product commencing on the approval date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. In November 2021, the Company purchased the rights for its Carglumic Acid product for , and that cost is being amortized over ten years. In September 2022, the Company purchased the rights for its Betaine Anhydrous product for , and that cost is being amortized over five years. In October 2023, the Company purchased the rights for its Nitisinone product for , and that cost is being amortized over five years. In March 2024, the Company purchased the rights for its PKU GOLIKE product which resulted in a intangible asset that is being amortized over ten years. The intangible assets, net on the Company s balance sheet, reflected of accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2024 . The Company recorded and , respectively, of amortization expense for the three and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 . The table below shows the estimated remaining amortization for these products for each of the five years from 2024 to 2028 and thereafter.

 Total estimated amortization expense 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the Company s statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. impairment was recognized during the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 . 
 
 Deferred Financing Costs, Debt Discount and Detachable Debt-Related Warrants 
 
 Costs incurred to issue debt are deferred and recorded as a reduction to the debt balance in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company amortizes these costs over the expected term of the related debt under the effective interest method. Debt discounts related to the relative fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with debt are also recorded as a reduction to the debt balance and accreted over the expected term into interest expense using the effective interested method. The fair value of warrants related to the issuance of a delayed draw term loan commitment is capitalized as short-term assets. Once a draw is made, the unamortized asset is reclassified as a reduction to the related debt balance and amortized into interest expense under the effective interest method. 

Leases 
 
 The Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842 Leases. The Company reviews all relevant facts and circumstances of a contract to determine if it is a lease whereby the terms of the agreement convey the right to control the direct use and receive substantially all the economic benefits of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The associated right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement. The Company measures lease liabilities based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term discounted using the rate it would pay on a loan with the equivalent payments and term for the lease. The Company does not include the impact for lease term options that would extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that it will exercise any such options. The Company accounts for the lease components separately from non-lease components for its operating leases. 
 
 The Company measures right-of-use assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for (i) any prepayments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs it incurs, and (iii) any incentives under the lease. In addition, the Company evaluates the recoverability of its right-of-use assets for possible impairment in accordance with its long-lived assets policy. 
 
 Operating leases are reflected on the balance sheets as operating lease right-of-use assets, current accrued liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities. The Company did not have any finance leases as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The Company commences recognizing operating lease expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use by the Company and the operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred. 
 
 The Company does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less; such lease costs are recorded in the statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk, Sources of Supply and Significant Customers 
 
 The Company is subject to credit risk for its cash and cash equivalents which are invested in high-grade money market funds and short-term U.S. treasury bills from time to time. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with one major commercial bank, and the deposits held with the financial institution exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits and is exposed to credit risk in the event of a default by the financial institutions holding its cash and cash equivalents to the extent recorded on the balance sheets. The Company believes the associated credit risk to be minimal. 
 
 The Company is dependent on third -party suppliers for its products and product candidates. In particular, the Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on a small number of suppliers to manufacture key chemicals, approved products and process its product candidates as part of its development programs. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the manufacturing process. 
 
 The Company is also subject to credit risk from its accounts receivable related to product sales as it extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition, and collateral is not required. The Company considers historical collection rates and the current financial status of its customers, as well as information from internal and external sources, macroeconomic and industry-specific factors, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when evaluating potential credit losses. Historically, the Company's accounts receivable balances have been highly concentrated with a select number of customers, consisting primarily of specialty pharmacies and large wholesale pharmaceutical distributors. Given the size and creditworthiness of these customers, we have not experienced and do not expect to experience material credit losses. Based upon the review of these factors, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 or 2023 . The accounts receivable balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and product sales revenue recognized during the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , primarily consist of sales to and amounts due from AnovoRx for sales of the Company s ALKINDI SPRINKLE and Carglumic Acid products. AnovoRx sales made up of total net revenues recognized in the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 and of net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 , and of total net revenues recognized in the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023 , and of net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023 . Given the size and creditworthiness of these customers, we have not experienced and do not expect to experience material credit losses. 

Revenue Recognition for Contracts with Customers 
 
 The Company accounts for contracts with its customers in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
 
 At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations to assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer s discretion are generally considered options. The Company assesses whether these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, they are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes. 
 
 The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method. Any amounts received prior to revenue recognition will be recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the twelve months following the balance sheet date will be classified as current portion of deferred revenue in the Company s balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the twelve months following the balance sheet date are classified as long-term deferred revenue, net of current portion. 
 
 Milestone Payments If a commercial contract arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, the Company will evaluate whether the milestone conditions have been achieved and if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur before recognizing the associated revenue. Milestone payments that are not within the Company s control or the licensee s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. 
 
 Royalties For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. 
 
 Significant Financing Component In determining the transaction price, the Company will adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the expected period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be more than one year. 
 
 The Company sells its ALKINDI SPRINKLE , Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, Nisitinone, and PKU GOLIKE products to pharmacy distributor customers which provide order fulfilment and inventory storage/distribution services. The Company may sell products in the U.S. to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who then sell the product to hospitals and other end-user customers. Sales to wholesalers are made pursuant to purchase orders subject to the terms of a master agreement, and delivery of individual shipments represent performance obligations under each purchase order. The Company uses a third -party logistics 3PL vendor to process and fulfill orders and has concluded it is the principal in the sales to wholesalers because it controls access to the 3PL vendor services rendered and directs the 3PL vendor activities. The Company has no significant obligations to wholesalers to generate pull-through sales. 
 
 For its ALKINDI SPRINKLE , Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, Nisitinone, and PKU GOLIKE products, the Company bills at the initial product list price which are subject to offsets for patient co-pay assistance and potential state Medicaid reimbursements which are estimated and recorded as a reduction of net revenues at the date of sale/shipment. Selling prices initially billed to wholesalers are subject to discounts for prompt payment and subsequent chargebacks when the wholesalers sell products at negotiated discounted prices to members of certain group purchasing organizations GPOs and government programs. Because of the shelf life of the product and the Company s lengthy return period, there may be a significant period of time between when the product is shipped and when it issues credits on returned product. 
 
 The Company estimates the transaction price when it receives each purchase order taking into account the expected reductions of the selling price initially billed to the wholesaler/distributor arising from all of the above factors. The Company has developed estimates for future returns and chargebacks and the impact of other discounts and fees it pays. When estimating these adjustments to the transaction price, the Company reduces it sufficiently to be able to assert that it is probable that there will be no significant reversal of revenue when the ultimate adjustment amounts are known. 

The Company stores its ALKINDI SPRINKLE , Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, Nisitinone, and PKU GOLIKE inventory at its pharmacy distributor customer locations, and revenue is recorded when stock is pulled and shipped to fulfill specific orders. The Company may recognize revenue and cost of sales from products sold to wholesalers upon delivery to the wholesaler location. At that time, the wholesalers take control of the product as they take title, bear the risk of loss of ownership and have an enforceable obligation to pay the Company. They also have the ability to direct sales of product to their customers on terms and at prices they negotiate. Although wholesalers have product return rights, the Company does not believe they have a significant incentive to return the product. 
 
 Upon recognition of revenue from product sales, the estimated amounts of credit for product returns, chargebacks, distribution fees, prompt payment discounts, state Medicaid and GPO fees are included in sales reserves, accrued liabilities and net accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , estimated state Medicaid liability was and , respectively. The Company monitors actual product returns, chargebacks, discounts and fees subsequent to the sale. If these amounts end up differing from its estimates, it will make adjustments to these allowances, which are applied to increase or reduce product sales revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of product sales consists of the profit-sharing and royalty fees with the Company s product licensing and development partners, the purchase costs for finished products from third -party manufacturers, freight and handling/storage from the Company s 3PL logistics service providers, and amortization expense of certain intangible assets. The costs of sales for profit-sharing, royalty fees, purchased finished products, and the associated inbound freight expense are recorded when the associated product sale revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of shipment to customers while outbound freight and handling/storage fees charged by the 3PL service provider are expensed as they are incurred. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product. Cost of product sales also reflects any write-downs or reserve adjustments for the Company s inventories. 
 
 Cost of licensing revenue consists of the profit-sharing fees related to the Company s product licensing and development partners. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development R D expenses include both internal R D activities and external contracted services. Internal R D activity expenses include salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and other costs to support the Company s R D operations. External contracted services include product development efforts such as certain product licensor milestone payments, clinical trial activities, manufacturing and control-related activities, and regulatory costs. R D expenses are charged to operations as incurred. The Company reviews and accrues R D expenses based on services performed and relies upon estimates of those costs applicable to the stage of completion of each project. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company s estimates. 
 
 Upfront payments and milestone payments made for the licensing of products that are not yet approved by the FDA are expensed as R D in the period in which they are incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in R D activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 As part of the process of preparing the Company s financial statements, the Company must estimate the actual current tax liabilities and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the balance sheets. The Company must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance must be established. To the extent the Company establishes a valuation allowance or increase or decrease to this allowance in a period, the impact will be included in income tax expense in the statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company has established a valuation reserve against its deferred tax assets. 
 
 The Company recorded income tax benefit o f an d zero for the three -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company recorded income tax benefit o f an d zero for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Our effective tax rate was for the three -month period ended September 30, 2024 and zero for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Our effective tax rate was for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024 and zero for the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023 . The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740 - Income Taxes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were unrecognized tax benefits included in the balance sheets that would, if recognized, affect the effective tax rate. The Company s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had accrual for interest or penalties in its balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and has not recognized interest and penalties in the statement of operations for the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 
 In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three -year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. 
 
 Income (Loss) Per Share 
 
 Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares, such as unvested restricted stock, stock options, RSUs and warrants that are outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the three -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , common stock equivalents excluded and , respectively, that were anti-dilutive. For the nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , common stock equivalents excluded and , respectively, that were anti-dilutive. Included in the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share calculation are RSUs awarded to directors that have vested, but the issuance and delivery of the shares of common stock are deferred until the director retires from service as a director. 

Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. The guidance under ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of the stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant and record expense over the related service periods, which are generally the vesting period of the equity awards. 
 
 The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model BSM ). The BSM requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of expected term, forfeitures and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields for zero -coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options or warrants. Dividends on common stock are assumed to be zero for the BSM valuation of the stock options. The expected term of stock options granted is based on vesting periods and the contractual life of the options. Expected volatilities are based on the Company's historical volatility subsequent to our IPO, which we believe represents the most accurate basis for estimating expected future volatility under the current conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 We measure certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value accounting requires characterization of the inputs used to measure fair value into a three -level fair value hierarchy as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market is a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
 
 Level 2 Observable inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent from the entity. 
 
 Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available. 
 
 Fair value measurements are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, which may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The determination of the fair values stated below take into account the market for the Company s financials, assets and liabilities, the associated credit risk and other factors as required. The Company considers active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
 
 The Company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and debt obligation. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company, the carrying value of the debt obligation approximates its fair value. 
 
 Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2023 - 07 Segment Reporting - Improving Reportable Segment Disclosures. The standard requires enhanced disclosures of a public company's significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when making resource allocation decisions, including for companies with a single reportable segment. The standard is effective for public companies for annual periods after December 15, 2023 and in interim periods in 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of the amendments, and it does not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on its financial statements as the Company only has one reportable segment. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023 - 09, Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The standard requires enhanced income tax disclosures, including the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid, amongst others. The standard will be effective for public companies for annual periods beginning in 2025, with early adoption permitted.

The pro rata fair value of the warrants related to the issuance of a delayed draw term loan commitment is capitalized as short-term assets. Once a draw is made, the unamortized asset is reclassified as a reduction to the related debt balance and amortized into interest expense under the effective interest method.

 Overview 
 
 Eton is an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases. The Company currently has five commercial rare disease products: ALKINDI SPRINKLE for the treatment of pediatric adrenocortical insufficiency; Carglumic Acid for the treatment of hyperammonemia due to N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency; Betaine Anhydrous for the treatment of homocystinuria; Nitisinone for the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1); and PKU GOLIKE medical formula for patients with phenylketonuria PKU ). The Company has three additional product candidates in late-stage development: ET-400, ET-600, and ZENEO hydrocortisone autoinjector. 
 
 Results of Operations (dollars in thousands) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had 10,324 in total revenue that generated a gross profit of 6,302. We had total revenue of 7,028 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 that generated a gross profit of 4,403 for the period. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume of the Company's ALKINDI SPRINKLE and Carglumic Acid products, along with sales volume from Nitisinone and PKU GOLIKE products launched in 2024 and licensing revenue of 500 from the sale of its DS-200 product candidate in September 2024. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 27,364 in total revenue that generated a gross profit of 16,935. We had total revenue of 24,329 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 that generated a gross profit of 17,431 for the period. The increase was primarily due to increased sales volume of the Company's ALKINDI SPRINKLE and Carglumic Acid products, along with sales volume from Nitisinone and PKU GOLIKE products launched in 2024, which were offset by decreased licensing revenue of 5,500 from the sale of royalty interests to Azurity in June 2023. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 505 of research and development R D expenses as compared to 615 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased expenses associated with ET-400 project development activities. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 4,126 of research and development R D expenses as compared to 2,275 for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses associated with ET-400 project development activities.

General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 G A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation expenses, legal and professional fees, product marketing expenses, distribution expenses, business insurance, travel expenses, and general office expenses. 
 
 For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 5,288 and 4,336, respectively, of G A expenses. The increase in G A expenses was mainly due to increased sales and marketing expenses and employee related expenses. 
 
 For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 16,035 and 14,355, respectively, of G A expenses. The increase in G A expenses was mainly due to increased sales and marketing expenses, legal fees, and employee related expenses. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of 35.8 million, cash and cash equivalents of 20.3 million and working capital of 10.0 million. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with continued product revenues, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months of our operations. However, our projected estimates for our product development spending, administrative expenses, and our working capital requirements could be inaccurate, or we may experience growth more quickly or on a larger scale than we expect, any of which could result in the depletion of capital resources more rapidly than anticipated and could require us to seek additional financing earlier than we expect to support our operations. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Change in cash and cash equivalents 

(1,127) 

5,765 

The decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a 5,500 sale of royalty interests to Azurity in June 2023, a 1,000 milestone payment related to 2023 ALKINDI SPRINKLE sales in January 2024, and increased inventory purchases for ALKINDI SPRINKLE , Carglumic Acid, Nitisinone, and PKU GOLIKE in 2024. The decrease in cash from investing activities was due to a 1,868 payment related to the acquisition of the PKU GOLIKE product license in March 2024. The decrease in cash from financing activities was primarily due to payments on the Company's long-term debt.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our financial statements included herein, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition 
 
 We account for contracts with our customers in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
 
 At contract inception, once we determine the contract falls within the scope of ASC 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer s discretion are generally considered options. We assess whether these options provide a material right to the customer and, if so, they are considered performance obligations. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes. 
 
 We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time, and if over time this is based on the use of an output or input method. Any amounts received prior to revenue recognition will be recorded as deferred revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the twelve months following the balance sheet date will be classified as current portion of deferred revenue in our balance sheets. Amounts not expected to be recognized as revenue within the twelve months following the balance sheet date are classified as long-term deferred revenue, net of current portion. 
 
 Milestone Payments If a commercial contract arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we will evaluate whether the milestone conditions have been achieved and if it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur before recognizing the associated revenue. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee s control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. 
 
 Royalties For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on a level of sales, which are the result of a customer-vendor relationship and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. 
 
 Significant Financing Component In determining the transaction price, we will adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the expected period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be more than one year.

Table of Contents 

The Company sells its ALKINDI SPRINKLE , Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, Nisitinone, and PKU GOLIKE products to pharmacy distributor customers which provide order fulfilment and inventory storage/distribution services. The Company may sell products in the U.S. to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who then sell the product to hospitals and other end-user customers. Sales to wholesalers are made pursuant to purchase orders subject to the terms of a master agreement, and delivery of individual shipments represent performance obligations under each purchase order. The Company uses a third-party logistics 3PL vendor to process and fulfill orders and has concluded it is the principal in the sales to wholesalers because it controls access to the 3PL vendor services rendered and directs the 3PL vendor activities. The Company has no significant obligations to wholesalers to generate pull-through sales. 
 
 For its ALKINDI SPRINKLE , Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, Nisitinone, and PKU GOLIKE products, the Company bills at the initial product list price which are subject to offsets for patient co-pay assistance and potential state Medicaid reimbursements which are estimated and recorded as a reduction of net revenues at the date of sale/shipment. Selling prices initially billed to wholesalers are subject to discounts for prompt payment and subsequent chargebacks when the wholesalers sell products at negotiated discounted prices to members of certain group purchasing organizations GPOs and government programs. Because of the shelf life of the product and the Company s lengthy return period, there may be a significant period of time between when the product is shipped and when the Company issues credits on returned product. 
 
 The Company estimates the transaction price when it receives each purchase order taking into account the expected reductions of the selling price initially billed to the wholesaler/distributor arising from all of the above factors. The Company has developed estimates for future returns and chargebacks and the impact of other discounts and fees it pays. When estimating these adjustments to the transaction price, the Company reduces it sufficiently to be able to assert that it is probable that there will be no significant reversal of revenue when the ultimate adjustment amounts are known. 
 
 The Company stores its ALKINDI SPRINKLE , Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, Nisitinone, and PKU GOLIKE inventory at its pharmacy distributor customer locations, and sales are recorded when stock is pulled and shipped to fulfill specific patient orders. The Company may recognize revenue and cost of sales from products sold to wholesalers upon delivery to the wholesaler location. At that time, the wholesalers take control of the product as they take title, bear the risk of loss of ownership and have an enforceable obligation to pay the Company. They also have the ability to direct sales of product to their customers on terms and at prices they negotiate. Although wholesalers have product return rights, the Company does not believe they have a significant incentive to return the product. 
 
 Upon recognition of revenue from product sales, the estimated amounts of credit for product returns, chargebacks, distribution fees, prompt payment discounts, state Medicaid and GPO fees are included in sales reserves, accrued liabilities and net accounts receivable. The Company monitors actual product returns, chargebacks, discounts and fees subsequent to the sale. If these amounts end up differing from its estimates, it will make adjustments to these allowances, which are applied to increase or reduce product sales revenue and earnings in the period of adjustment. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. The guidance under ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of the stock-based compensation awards on the date of grant and record expense over the related service periods, which are generally the vesting period of the equity awards. 
 
 The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based option awards using the BSM. The BSM requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of expected term, forfeitures and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options or warrants. Dividends on common stock are assumed to be zero for the BSM valuation of the stock options. The expected term of stock options granted is based on vesting periods and the contractual life of the options. Expected volatilities are based on the Company's historical volatility subsequent to our IPO, which we believe represents the most accurate basis for estimating expected future volatility under the current conditions. We account for forfeitures as they occur.

Table of Contents 

Research and Development Expenses 
 
 R D expenses include both internal R D activities and external contracted services. Internal R D activity expenses include salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, and other costs to support our R D operations. External contracted services include product development efforts including certain product licensor milestone payments, clinical trial activities, manufacturing and control-related activities, and regulatory costs. R D expenses are charged to operations as incurred. We review and accrue R D expenses based on services performed and rely upon estimates of those costs applicable to the stage of completion of each project. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from our estimates. 
 
 Upfront payments and milestone payments made for the licensing of products that are not yet approved by the FDA are expensed as R D in the period in which they are incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in R D activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Transactions 
 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet transactions. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital. We do not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments. We are exposed to certain market risks relating primarily to interest rate risk on our cash and cash equivalents and risks relating to the financial viability of the institutions which hold our capital and through which we have invested our funds. We manage such risks by investing in short-term, liquid, highly rated instruments. As of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents only included cash deposits at our bank. From time to time, we do have cash investments in short-term money market or U.S. treasury bills. We do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk in the current interest rate environment and the short duration of the invested funds we hold. Declines in interest rates would reduce our investment income but would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We do not currently have exposure to foreign currency risk.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective 
 
 The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 
 With respect to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

(d) The aggregate Exercise Price for the number of Warrant Shares being purchased may also, in the sole discretion of the Holder, be paid in full or in part on a cashless basis at the election of the Holder:

For purposes of this Warrant, the term Fair Market Value means with respect to a particular date, the average closing price of the Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the applicable exercise herein as officially reported by the principal securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed or admitted to trading, or, if the Common Stock is not listed or admitted to trading on any securities exchange as determined in good faith by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, based on the best information available to it. 

To illustrate a cashless exercise of this Warrant under Section 1.1(d)(ii) (or for a portion thereof for which cashless exercise treatment is requested as contemplated by Section 1.1(d)(iii) hereof), the calculation of such exercise shall be as follows: 

X = Y (A-B)/A

Y = the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is being exercised. 

A = the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock. 

B = the applicable Exercise Price.

On or before the first (1st) trading day following the date on which the Company has received the applicable Exercise Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile or electronic mail an acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of the Exercise Notice to the Holder and the Company s transfer agent (the Transfer Agent ). So long as the Holder delivers the aggregate Exercise Price (or notice of a cashless exercise) on or prior to the second (2nd) trading day following the date on which the Exercise Notice has been delivered to the Company, then on or prior to the third (3rd) trading day following the date on which the Exercise Notice has been delivered to the Company, or, if the Holder does not deliver the aggregate Exercise Price (or notice of a cashless exercise) on or prior to the second (2nd) trading day following the date on which the Exercise Notice has been delivered to the Company, then on or prior to the second (2nd) trading day following the date on which the aggregate Exercise Price (or notice of a cashless exercise) is delivered (the Share Delivery Date ), the Company shall (X) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in The Depository Trust Company DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC through its Deposit / Withdrawal At Custodian system, or (Y) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and dispatch by overnight courier to the address as specified in the Exercise Notice, a certificate, registered in the Company s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise.

If this Warrant is physically delivered to the Company in connection with any exercise pursuant to this Section 1.1 and the number of Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant submitted for exercise is greater than the number of Warrant Shares being acquired upon an exercise, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) trading days after any exercise and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the Holder (or its designee) a new Warrant representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares issuable immediately prior to such exercise under this Warrant, less the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is exercised. No fractional Warrant Shares are to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant, but rather the number of Warrant Shares to be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. The Company shall pay any and all transfer, stamp, issuance and similar taxes, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent) which may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.

The Company may request a certificate from the Holder upon receipt of an Exercise Notice to the effect that the Holder does not beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below), and the Company shall have the right to rely on such certificate. 

1.4 Automatic Exercise . In the event that, upon any applicable Expiration Date or other termination of this Warrant, the Fair Market Value of one Warrant Share (or other security issuable upon the exercise hereof) as determined in accordance with Section 1.3 hereof is greater than the applicable Exercise Price in effect on such date for any applicable Warrant Tranche, then this Warrant shall automatically be deemed on and as of such date to be exercised pursuant to this Section 1.4 as to all Warrant Shares (or such other securities) of such applicable Warrant Tranche or Tranches for which it shall not previously have been exercised and which are then expiring, and the Company shall promptly deliver the Warrant Shares (or such other securities) issued upon such exercise to Holder in accordance with Section 1.3.

1.5 Holder s Exercise Limitations . The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 1 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Exercise Notice, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties.

In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one (1) trading day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 1.5, provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 1.5 shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 1.5 to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.

Nothing shall limit the Holder s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company s failure to timely deliver certificates representing Warrant Shares (or to electronically deliver such Warrant Shares) upon the exercise of this Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. While this Warrant is outstanding, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to participate in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program. In addition to the foregoing rights, if the Company fails to deliver the applicable number of Warrant Shares upon an exercise pursuant to Section 1 by the applicable Share Delivery Date, then the Holder shall have the right to rescind such exercise in whole or in part and retain and/or have the Company return, as the case may be, any portion of this Warrant that has not been exercised pursuant to such Exercise Notice; provided that the rescission of an exercise shall not affect the Company s obligation to make any payments that have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to this Section 1.6 or otherwise.

2.1 Mergers or Consolidations . If at any time after the date hereof there shall be a capital reorganization (other than a combination or subdivision of Common Stock otherwise provided for herein) resulting in a reclassification to or change in the terms of securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (a Reorganization ), or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another corporation, association, partnership, organization, business, individual, government or political subdivision thereof or a governmental agency (a Person or the Persons (other than a merger with another Person in which the Company is a continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification or change in the terms of securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant or a merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the Company) (a Merger ), any tender or exchange offers (a Tender Offer ), the acquisition of at least 50 of the Company s shares or voting power by any Person or Persons (a Majority Transaction or any partial or complete liquidation, purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company Asset Sale ), then, as a part of such Reorganization, Merger, Tender Offer, Majority Transaction or Asset Sale (each a Corporate Transaction ), lawful provision and adjustment shall be made so that the Holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of stock or any other equity or debt securities or property receivable upon such Corporate Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock which might have been purchased upon exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction.
