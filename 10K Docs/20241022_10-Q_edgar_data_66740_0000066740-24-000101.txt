 3M Company and Subsidiaries 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Certain amounts in prior periods consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented. 
 As discussed in Note 2, on April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business (the Separation) through a pro rata distribution of of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. As a result of the Separation, Solventum became an independent public company and 3M no longer consolidates Solventum into 3M s financial results. In connection with the Separation, the historical net income of Solventum and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation are reported in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. 
 3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024 as further described in Note 19. To the extent these changes impacted 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue information, data in Note 3 has also been updated. 

of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. The spin-off transaction was intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To reflect the completion of the spin, 3M recorded a decrease in shareholders equity for the net book value of applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation, net of the book value of 3M's retained ownership. As a result of the Separation, Solventum became an independent public company and 3M no longer consolidates Solventum into 3M s financial results. In connection with the Separation, the historical net income of Solventum and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation are reported in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. Following the Separation, as 3M no longer controls or has the ability to exert significant influence over Solventum, 3M measures, at fair value on a recurring basis, its retained ownership interest in Solventum common stock (see additional information in Note 7). 3M expects to monetize its stake in Solventum over time. 
 The Company entered into various agreements to effect the Separation and provide for the relationship between 3M and Solventum, including, among others, a separation and distribution agreement; a tax matters agreement; and transition service, distribution, and contract manufacturing agreements; as well as certain commercial supply agreements. The transition service and distribution agreements have overall terms of following the Separation and each may be extended an additional year. The transition contract manufacturing agreement's term is with an ability to extend under certain circumstances. Supply agreements, by which each company may provide product to the other, have initial terms, but may extend for particular products up to ten or following the Separation, under certain circumstances. In addition, the companies had certain amounts due between them as of the Separation date.

percent on pre-tax income compared to percent on a pre-tax loss in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was percent compared to percent on a pre-tax loss in the prior year. The primary factors that impacted the comparison of these rates year-over-year were the third quarter 2023 charge related to the settlement agreement to resolve CAE litigation (see Note 17), second quarter 2023 charge related to the settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (see Note 17), and the tax rate associated with the 2024 benefit related to the change in value of the retained ownership interest in Solventum. 
 The total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 on a continuing operations basis are million and million, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3M s unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 
 Net deferred tax assets are included as components of Other Assets and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2024, 3M's net non current deferred tax asset balance was approximately billion. This included a balance of approximately billion as a result of the 2023 pre-tax charges related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement (both discussed in Note 17). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a continuing operations basis, the Company had valuation allowances of billion and billion on its deferred tax assets, respectively, with the amounts impacted beginning in 2024 by a valuation allowance related to the difference in basis of the retained ownership interest in Solventum. 
 In connection with the completion of the separation of Solventum in April 2024, 3M re-evaluated its global cash needs and certain unrepatriated earnings were no longer considered permanently reinvested, which resulted in a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of 2024. Thereafter, 3M provides for income taxes associated with foreign earnings in certain subsidiaries that are not considered permanently reinvested. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining a global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15 . The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. Effective January 1, 2024, a number of countries have proposed or enacted legislation to implement core elements of the Pillar Two proposal. Pillar Two did not have a significant impact on 3M's third quarter 2024 results. While 3M is monitoring developments and evaluating the potential impact on future periods, 3M does not expect Pillar Two to have a significant impact on its 2024 financial results.

 In the first quarter of 2024, Solventum, prior to the Separation discussed in Note 2, issued a total of billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured debt and term loans. Also during the first quarter of 2024, Solventum further entered into a revolving credit facility of billion which was undrawn as of March 31, 2024. These Solventum items were guaranteed by 3M until the completion of the Separation on April 1, 2024 and obligations under these notes, loans and facilities became, as transferred obligations, the sole responsibility of Solventum after the Separation. 
 In February 2024, 3M repaid billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes that matured.

 million were made to the Company s U.S. and international pension plans and million to its postretirement plans, including discontinued operations. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3M does not expect the previously disclosed range of million to million of expected 2024 cash contributions to its U.S. and international retirement plans to be materially impacted by the April 1, 2024 separation of Solventum (see Note 2). 3M s annual measurement date for pension and postretirement assets and liabilities is December 31 each year, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, 3M recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately million reflected in other expense (income), net as a result of transferring approximately billion of its U.S. pension payment obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company. The pension risk transfer required remeasurement of the plan prior to the calculation of the settlement charge. The net impact of the pension risk transfer and the remeasurement was a decrease of approximately million in the non-current liability for pensions (and corresponding decrease in accumulated comprehensive loss, before deferred taxes). Assumptions used for this remeasurement included discount rates determined using June 30, 2024 market conditions and calculated using the same methodology as disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of for the U.S. pension plan as of June 30, 2024. The Company also reduced the expected return on assets assumption determined using June 30, 2024 market conditions and calculated using the same methodology as used at the annual measurement as of December 31, 2023. All other assumptions were consistent with the December 31, 2023 disclosures. This remeasurement impacts net periodic benefit cost for the remainder of 2024. 
 As of March 31, 2024, 3M transferred eligible U.S. Solventum employees and retirees to new U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans with the same benefits of their current plans. The transfer required remeasurement of the plans prior to the calculation of this split. The net impact of the remeasurement was a decrease of approximately million in the non-current liability for pension and postretirement benefits (and corresponding decrease in accumulated comprehensive loss, before deferred taxes). Assumptions used for this remeasurement included discount rates determined using March 31, 2024 market conditions and calculated using the same methodology as disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. All other assumptions were consistent with the December 31, 2023 disclosures. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of for the U.S. pension plans and for the U.S. postretirement benefit plans as of March 31, 2024, which are increases of percentage points and percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2023. This remeasurement did not impact consolidated income for the three months ended March 31, 2024, but will impact net periodic benefit cost for the remainder of 2024. As of March 31, 2024, there were several small international pension plans remeasured for purposes of transferring Solventum employees to new pension plans, the impact of which was not material.

 Impact of Solventum Spin-Off : On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business, known as Solventum, as an independent company. Concurrent with the spin-off, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements, including transition agreements and a separation and distribution agreement that, among other things, identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, indemnification and defense obligations, and the contracts to be transferred to Solventum and 3M as part of the spin-off. In general, and except as noted below and as set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, certain liabilities related to Solventum or the assets that are transferred to Solventum in connection with the spin-off will be retained by or transferred to Solventum. For example, potential liabilities associated with the matters previously described under the Bair Hugger and Federal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation sections of this Note 17 have been assumed by Solventum pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, and Solventum will indemnify and defend the Company in these actions. 
 The separation and distribution agreement governs the allocation of liabilities related to PFAS (as defined below) between the Company and Solventum, which liabilities will not be subject to the general allocation principles otherwise set forth in the separation and distribution agreement. The Company will retain all PFAS-related liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of (x) the Company s business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) and (y) Solventum s business (as defined in the separation and distribution agreement) prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum will retain liability for all PFAS-related liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of its business at or after April 1, 2024, other than liabilities from product claims alleging harm from the presence of PFAS in certain products of Solventum s business sold at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to exceptions described in further detail below). The Company will retain liabilities related to site-based PFAS contamination at any real property owned, leased or operated by the Company and liabilities for site-based PFAS contamination arising from third-party claims at sites allocated to the Solventum group in the separation to the extent such liabilities relate to PFAS contamination existing at or prior to April 1, 2024. Solventum assumes PFAS liabilities from the Solventum sites to the extent resulting from an action taken by any member of the Solventum group following April 1, 2024, or from any failure by Solventum following April 1, 2024, to use commercially reasonable efforts that are consistent with then-current industry standards to avoid contamination. The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company s products, (y) arising from Solventum s products sold prior to April 1, 2024, and (z) arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the exceptions described below). Clause (z) in the immediately preceding sentence will not extend to PFAS liabilities for product claims resulting from (i) new products introduced by Solventum following April 1, 2024, that contain or are enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, (ii) products that are modified by Solventum after April 1, 2024, to add, contain or become enabled by PFAS that is not supplied by the Company, or with respect to which any modification made after April 1, 2024, in the formulation or production of the product that changes the amount or type of PFAS contained in the product or the amount or type of PFAS enabling the product, in each case from and after the date of such modification, (iii) PFAS that is added to a Solventum product after it is sold by Solventum and (iv) PFAS that has accumulated in or on a Solventum product as a result of the use of the product (whether or not the product is being used as directed), including through filtration, purification or similar application. Solventum will be responsible for the maintenance of certain PFAS containment measures at its properties after the effective time of the distribution. In addition, and consistent with the allocation described above, the Company will retain specifically identified PFAS-related liabilities, including those resulting from specified PFAS-related litigation matters and liabilities under the Company s settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States, as described below.

 of the cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits described below) and, in the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended respirator product liability trials. In November 2023, a jury in Hawaii delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M s 8710 respirator was not a cause of plaintiff s mesothelioma. In February 2024, a jury in Kentucky delivered a defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that 3M s 8710 and 8210 respirators that the plaintiff claimed to have used were not defective. In April 2024, another jury in Kentucky returned a defense verdict in 3M's favor and concluded that 3M's 8710 respirator that the plaintiff claimed to have used was not defective. 
 The Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants. In the second half of 2020 and into 2021, the Company experienced an increase in the number of cases filed that allege injuries from exposures to coal mine dust, but the rate of coal mine dust-related case filings decelerated in 2022 and continues to stay significantly lower than in 2021. 3M moved cases involving over plaintiffs to federal court based on, among others, the Class Action Fairness Act. The federal district court remanded the cases to state court. In March 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals granted 3M's petition to review the remand order, and in April 2023 reversed the district court's remand order; accordingly, those cases will remain in federal court. 
 As previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. In October 2019, the court granted the State s motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim, which seeks civil penalties of up to per violation under the state's Consumer Credit Protection Act relating to statements that the State contends were misleading about 3M s respirators. In April 2024, the court set a trial date for the unfair trade practices claims in December 2024. In October 2024, the court moved the trial date to January 7, 2025, for a bench trial only to determine if any liability exists; if liability is found by the judge, then damages would be determined in a separate trial with an advisory jury at a later date. An expert witness retained by the State has estimated that 3M sold over respirators into the state during the relevant time period, and the State alleges that each respirator sold constitutes a separate violation under the Act. 3M disputes the expert's estimates and the State's position regarding what constitutes a separate violation of the Act. 3M has asserted various additional defenses, including that the Company's marketing did not violate the Act at any time, and that the State's claims are barred under the applicable statute of limitations. liability has been recorded for any portion of this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss due to open factual and legal questions. 
 Respirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables 
 The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company s mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims (collectively, the Claims Data ). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses this analysis to develop its estimate of probable liability.

 million. In the first nine months of 2024, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of million. This accrual represents the Company s estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of (i) the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the fact that complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant s share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Company s estimate of liabilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. In addition, the Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims. 
 Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation Aearo Technologies: On April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies Aearo ). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearo s respirator business (American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation Cabot )) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the Payor Group ). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the AO Safety brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of , Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearo s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995, period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.

 of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of those compounds by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter-chain-length PFAS compounds. These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company s policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3M s current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.

 actions with respect to PFAS: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M is progressing toward the exit of all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. 3M is also working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025 and has made progress in eliminating the use of PFAS across its product portfolio in a variety of applications. With respect to PFAS-containing products not manufactured by 3M in the Company's supply chains, the Company continues to evaluate the availability and feasibility of third-party products that do not contain PFAS. Depending on the availability and feasibility of such third-party products not containing PFAS, the Company continues to evaluate circumstances in which the use of PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties and used in certain applications in 3M s product portfolios, such as lithium ion batteries, printed circuit boards and certain seals and gaskets, all widely used in commerce across a variety of industries, and in some cases required by regulatory or industry standards, may or are expected to, depending on applications, continue beyond 2025. In other cases, regulatory approval, customer re-certification or re-qualification of substitutes or replacements to eliminate the use of PFAS manufactured by third parties may not be completed, or, depending on circumstances, are not expected to be completed, by the end of 2025. With respect to PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties, the Company intends to continue to evaluate beyond the end of 2025 the adoption of third-party products that do not contain PFAS to the extent such products are available and such adoption is feasible. 
 PFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity 
 Regulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, and increasingly stringent restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions and environmental media, in some cases moving towards presently non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulatory limits for PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are being set at increasingly low levels. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS, including PFAS compounds manufactured by 3M, used in current 3M products or generated as byproducts or degradation products from certain 3M production processes. Finally, in certain jurisdictions, legislation is being considered that, if enacted, might authorize the recovery from individuals or entities costs alleged to have been imposed on the jurisdiction's healthcare system, as well as related costs. If such activity continues, including as regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of regulation-related litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3M s reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory drinking water and other environmental standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required. 
 Europe 
 In the European Union, where 3M has PFAS manufacturing facilities in Germany and Belgium, recent regulatory activities have included various proposed and enacted restrictions of PFAS or certain PFAS compounds, including under the EU s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") and the EU s Persistent Organic Pollutants ("POPs") Regulation. PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS (and their related compounds) are listed under several Annexes of the POPs Regulation, resulting in a ban in manufacture, placing on the market and use as well as some waste management requirements of these substances in EU Member States. These substances have also been listed in the Stockholm Convention, which has been ratified by more than 180 countries and aims for global elimination of certain listed substances (with narrow exceptions). In February 2023, an EU-wide restriction on the manufacturing, use, placing on the market and import of certain perfluorocarboxylic acids (C9-C14 PFCAs), which are PFAS substances, also went into effect. In September 2024, the EU adopted a restriction on certain uses of perfluorohexanoic acid PFHxA and PFHxA-related substances, including in consumer goods and some uses of firefighting foams and concentrates. 
 With respect to the applicability of the amendment of the EU POPs Regulation to include PFOA, which has been applicable since 2021, Dyneon, a 3M subsidiary that operates the Gendorf facility in Germany, proactively consulted with the relevant German competent authority regarding improvements necessary to meet applicable limits for a recycling process for a critical emulsifier for which small amounts of PFOA are present after recycling as an unintended contaminant. In consultation with German regulatory authorities, to achieve the applicable limits for the use of the emulsifier until the exit of PFAS manufacturing, Dyneon has started to use a method containing a mix of recycled and virgin emulsifier. 
 In February 2023, the European Chemicals Agency published a proposal to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market, and use of PFAS under REACH, subject to certain proposed exceptions. In March 2023, the six-month consultation phase on the PFAS Restriction Proposal started and, in September 2023, the Company submitted comments on the proposal. Depending on the timing, scope, and obligations contained in any final restriction, PFAS manufacturers and manufacturers of PFAS-containing products including 3M could incur additional costs and potential exposures, including costs of having to discontinue or modify products, future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement actions.

 million, including enhancements to site discharge control technologies, support for qualifying local commercial farmers impacted by restrictions on sale of agricultural products, ongoing off-site descriptive soil investigation, amounts to address certain identified priority remedial actions (which may include supporting additional actions as required under the Flemish Soil Decree), funds to be used by the Flemish Government in its sole discretion in connection with PFAS emissions from the Zwijndrecht facility, and support for the Oosterweel Project in cash and support services. The agreement contains certain provisions ending litigation and providing certain releases of liability for 3M Belgium, while recognizing that the Flemish Government retains its authority to act in the future to protect its citizenry, as specified in the agreement. In connection with these actions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately million in the first half of 2022. 
 Soil remediation . Consistent with Flemish environmental law, descriptive soil investigations DSIs have been carried out to assess areas of potential PFAS contamination that may require remediation. An accredited third-party soil remediation expert has conducted these DSIs. 3M Belgium has submitted all currently required DSIs. 
 Further, as previously disclosed, the accredited third-party soil remediation expert prepared multiple remedial action plans that have been approved by OVAM, the competent authority, and implementation activities are underway. Additional remedial action plans are pending and waiting for OVAM's approval. Other anticipated additional remedial action plans are scheduled to be submitted for OVAM s review by the end of 2024. 3M Belgium representatives continue to have discussions with the relevant authorities regarding further soil remedial actions in connection with the Flemish Soil Decree. 
 Changes to Flemish Soil Decree . In December 2022, the Flemish Cabinet took steps to implement an executive action (the Site Decision designed to expand 3M Belgium s remedial obligations around the Zwijndrecht site. On March 31, 2023, the Site Decision was fully approved by the Flemish Cabinet and the Site Decision was published in April 2023. While the full impact of the Site Decision remains to be determined, it appears to establish conditional obligations within 5 kilometers of Zwijndrecht and may create a presently undetermined amount of additional financial and remedial obligations for 3M Belgium. In June 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a petition for annulment of the Site Decision to the Belgian Council of State. In September 2023, the Flemish government submitted its response to the petition. 3M Belgium filed its final submission responding to the Flemish government s arguments in November 2023. Various parties purporting to have an interest in the proceeding, including the government of the Netherlands, intervened and submitted arguments supporting the Site Decision. 
 In July 2023, the Flemish government approved another executive action establishing a temporary action framework that sets soil and groundwater values for evaluation of remediation of PFAS. While the full impact of the temporary action framework remains to be determined, its use of the values in the EU Drinking Water Directive for remediation of groundwater, regardless of whether the groundwater would be used for drinking water, may create a presently undetermined amount of additional financial and remedial obligations for 3M Belgium. In December 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a petition for annulment of the temporary action framework to the Belgian Council of State. 
 In May 2024, the Flemish government adopted legislation expanding the authority of OVAM to require financial security for remediation work and giving it the ability to impose a percentage of the cost of remediating river sediment on various parties while requiring financial assurance for such work. OVAM has not yet required such financial security from 3M Belgium or imposed such costs on 3M Belgium. These actions potentially could create presently undetermined additional financial obligations for 3M Belgium. 
 Pending or potential litigation and investigations outside the United States 
 Litigation . 
 Belgium . As of September 30, 2024, a total of actions against 3M Belgium are pending in Belgian civil courts. 3M Belgium has also received pre-litigation notices from individuals and entities in Belgium indicating potential claims. The pending cases include claims by individuals, municipalities, and other entities for alleged soil and wastewater or rainwater contamination with PFAS, nuisance, tort liability, personal injury and for an environmental injunction. 
 While most of the actions are in early stages, of the actions resulted in an award of provisional damages of euros to each of family members who live near the Zwijndrecht site.

 actions against 3M, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. DuPont ), and Chemours Co. ("Chemours") on behalf of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP"), the NJDEP s commissioner, and the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund regarding alleged discharges at DuPont facilities in Pennsville, New Jersey (Salem County) and Parlin, New Jersey (Middlesex County). 3M is included as a defendant in both cases because it allegedly supplied PFOA to DuPont for use at the facilities at issue and because 3M allegedly sent PFAS-containing waste to one of the facilities for disposal. Both cases expressly seek to have the defendants pay all costs necessary to investigate, remediate, assess, and restore the facilities at issue and the affected natural resources of New Jersey. DuPont removed these cases to federal court. In June 2020, the court consolidated the actions, along with others brought by the NJDEP relating to the DuPont facilities, for case management and pretrial purposes. 3M and the NJDEP continue mediation.

 billion to billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement. 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of billion in the second quarter of 2023. The charge reflected the present value (discounted at an estimated interest rate at time of proposed settlement) of the expected billion nominal value of 3M s payments under the PWS Settlement. The PWS Settlement, as amended to include payments to the cities of Stuart, Rome and Middlesex (as discussed below), calls for 3M to make payments from 2024 through 2036. The actual amounts that 3M will pay will be determined in part by which class members that do not have a positive test result for the presence of PFAS in their drinking water (as defined by the PWS Settlement) as of the date of the PWS Settlement and those that receive such a test result by the end of 2025. 
 The deadline for eligible public water systems to opt out of the PWS Settlement was December 11, 2023, and the Court approved the PWS Settlement in March 2024. 
 In December 2023, the parties selected an initial set of plaintiffs for potential personal injury bellwether cases. In March 2024, the Court issued an order establishing a process for addressing most personal injury claims for diseases not included in the initial set of cases and four other diseases, which has resulted in the dismissal without prejudice of thousands of personal injury claims. The process includes a tolling provision for certain dismissed claims filed in or transferred to the MDL by April 24, 2024. In July 2024, the court selected out of the bellwether cases to undergo additional discovery, including expert discovery. In September 2024, the Court issued an order requiring the parties to submit a proposed process for an additional set of personal injury claims not addressed in either the initial personal injury bellwether cases or the dismissal process. In October 2024 the Court set October 6, 2025, as the date for the first bellwether personal injury trial. 
 Under the MDL case management order, by January 2025, the parties must meet and confer on which of the 9 potential personal injury bellwether cases will move forward with dispositive motion practice and any trials. The court also continues to encourage the parties to consider settlement of certain personal injury claims.

 AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL, and case was voluntarily dismissed. The cases that remain pending in state courts are stayed by agreement of the parties. 
 The Company is aware of other AFFF suits outside the AFFF MDL in which the Company has been named a defendant. 3M anticipates that most of these cases will eventually be removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL; however, several cases are expected to remain pending in state courts, including a case in Illinois state court brought by an oil refinery worker alleging harm caused by PFAS and other chemicals. 
 Separately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. 
 In June 2023, the City of Springfield, Missouri sued 3M and other defendants in the AFFF MDL. Springfield s complaint alleges that 3M and other defendants are liable for damage to Springfield s public water system from PFAS attributable to AFFF. Springfield opted out of the PWS Settlement and its lawsuit remains pending in the MDL. In June 2024, Springfield filed a lawsuit in federal court in Missouri against 3M alleging violations of the federal Clean Water Act and the RCRA. 3M has sought to transfer this case to the AFFF MDL. Plaintiff has opposed transfer and a briefing schedule has been set on plaintiff's opposition. Separately, 3M has reported to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources MDNR the presence of PFAS in soil and water at the Springfield facility. 3M is addressing that matter under supervision of the MDNR. 
 Other PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation 
 Numerous other PFAS-related suits naming 3M as a defendant have been filed outside the MDL in courts across the country in which 3M has been named a defendant. The Company anticipates most of the cases that relate to AFFF will ultimately be removed to federal court and transferred to the MDL. However, some of these cases are likely to remain in state or federal courts outside of the MDL. 
 3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M s customers improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater, surface water, or biosolids that were then land-applied. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including, but not limited to, DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet, paper, and textile manufacturers. 
 The cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will be covered by the PWS Settlement if the water providers did not opt out of the PWS Settlement. 
 In Alabama, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending state court cases brought by municipal water utilities. The plaintiffs in one of these cases (Shelby/Talladega Counties) are water utilities alleging that the carpet manufacturers in Georgia improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River in Alabama. The case is now in active discovery. In the second action, 3M is defending a putative class action by the Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the EPA. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2022, which was granted in part and denied in part in February 2023. The case is proceeding through discovery and a trial date has been set in June 2026. In the third case, the city of Albertville, Alabama recently filed suit for alleged contamination of the Tennessee River (upstream of 3M s Decatur facility) by a carpet manufacturer located upriver in Alabama. Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss in May 2024. In the fourth case, the city of Mobile alleges that 3M and other defendants are responsible for PFAS contamination of the city s water supply resulting from PFAS released by a local landfill. 3M filed a motion to dismiss this case in June 2024. In the fifth case, the Town of Pine Hill, Alabama filed suit alleging that PFAS discharges from paper mills currently owned by International Paper have contaminated its water supply. 3M removed the case to federal court, where plaintiff has filed a motion for remand. In the sixth case, the City of Irondale, Alabama filed suit alleging PFAS contamination of its water supply due to industrial discharges from several users of PFAS in different industries, including alleged customers of 3M. 3M has not yet responded to that complaint. 
 3M is also defending a mass action filed in Alabama in June 2024 by hundreds of individual customers of the Water Works and Sewer Board for the City of Gadsden, Alabama, alleging emotional distress and property damage related to PFAS contamination of their drinking water. 3M removed the case to federal court.

 landowners in Gordon County, Georgia sued 3M and other defendants for alleged contamination of their properties from wastewater treatment sludge allegedly containing PFAS from nearby carpet manufacturing operations. One of 3M s co-defendant s, the City of Calhoun, Georgia, has filed a cross claim against 3M and other defendants alleging that biosolids from its wastewater treatment plant were contaminated with PFAS that has migrated into its water supply. 3M filed motions to dismiss the complaint and cross claim. In June 2024, a related lawsuit was filed on behalf of other property owners receiving biosolids from the same municipal water treatment plant. 3M has moved to dismiss this matter. In July 2024, the City of Lyerly sued 3M and other defendants, alleging that discharges from local carpet mills contaminated the City's water supply. 3M has moved to dismiss those claims. 
 In Delaware, 3M is defending putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their water supply resulting from the operations of local metal plating facilities. Plaintiffs allege that 3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont, Chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants. This case was removed to federal court, and in September 2022, the court dismissed all but plaintiffs negligence claim. In November 2022, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint seeking to replead certain previously dismissed claims and, in August 2023, the court once again dismissed all but plaintiffs' negligence claim. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in August 2024, which is now being briefed by the parties. 
 3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending numerous cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water wells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. 3M has agreed to settle with the plaintiffs in certain cases that sought property damages, subject in certain cases to court approval. Plaintiffs in the remaining individual cases allege personal injuries to themselves or to their disabled adult children, and those cases are proceeding through discovery. 
 3M and Middlesex Water Company are defending a putative class action filed in New Jersey federal court in November 2021 by individuals who received drinking water from Middlesex Water Company that was allegedly contaminated with PFOA. In May 2022, Middlesex Water Company filed a third-party complaint against the Company in New Jersey state court in a putative class action brought by customers of the water company, seeking contribution and indemnity from the Company. In November 2023, Middlesex Water Company dismissed its third-party complaint against the Company in connection with the settlement of Middlesex Water Company's separate action against 3M. The parties to the New Jersey federal and state court class actions have agreed to settle these cases for an immaterial amount, subject to court approval. In March 2023, a personal injury lawsuit was filed against 3M and Middlesex Water Company by another Middlesex Water Company customer. In May 2023, 3M filed a motion to dismiss certain of the claims in that lawsuit and plaintiff subsequently amended his complaint to withdraw certain claims against 3M. The case is now proceeding in discovery. 
 In South Carolina, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in South Carolina state court against 3M, DuPont and DuPont related entities in March 2022. The lawsuit alleges property damage and personal injuries from contamination from PFAS compounds used and disposed of at the textile plant known as the Galey Lord plant from 1966 until 2016. The complaint seeks remedies including damages, punitive damages, and medical monitoring. The case has been removed to federal court. Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint in November 2022, and 3M and DuPont filed a joint motion to dismiss, which was largely denied in September 2023. The case is now proceeding in discovery. In August of 2024, a companion personal injury case was filed in South Carolina. That case is in its early stages and does not contain class allegations. 
 In Massachusetts, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in August 2022 in state court against 3M and several other defendants alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by local paper manufacturing facilities that was subsequently incorporated into biosolids. The lawsuit alleges property damage and also seeks medical monitoring on behalf of plaintiffs within the Town of Westminster. This case was removed to federal court. In February 2023, the federal court consolidated this action with a previously-filed federal case involving similar allegations and claims against 3M s co-defendants. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint asserting claims against 3M. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in March 2023. The motion was granted in part and denied in part in December 2023. In February and March 2024, 3M and the remaining defendants answered the complaint and filed cross claims against one another. The case is now proceeding in discovery. In March and April 2024, 3M s co-defendants filed several motions to add new third-party defendants. 3M subsequently filed a motion to add cross claims against most of the new proposed third-party defendants, if they are added to the case. The court denied the motion to add one party in August 2024 and other motions remain pending.

 In Missouri, in April 2024, 3M and certain DuPont-related entities were added as defendants to a pending putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their properties and drinking water from metal plating operations in southeastern Missouri. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in June 2024. In May 2024, 3M was named as a defendant in a putative class action brought by individuals claiming exposure to PFAS from drinking water in Canton, Missouri. 3M filed a motion to transfer this case to the AFFF MDL. 
 In Connecticut, in June 2024, 3M and numerous other defendants were sued in a putative class action brought by individual firefighters and several firefighter unions, alleging exposure to PFAS from certain turnout gear worn by the class members. 3M filed a motion to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL, which plaintiffs have opposed. 
 In October 2018, 3M and other defendants, including DuPont and Chemours, were named in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio brought by the named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to PFAS chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purporting to represent a putative class of all U.S. individuals with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood. In March 2022, the court certified a class of "[i]ndividuals subject to the laws of Ohio, who have 0.05 [ppt] of PFOA (C-8) and at least 0.05 ppt of any other PFAS in their blood serum." In November 2023, the Sixth Circuit issued an order vacating the class certification decision and remanding the case with instructions that the district court dismiss the case. In January 2024, the Sixth Circuit denied a motion by plaintiffs for en banc rehearing of that order. In March 2024, the district court vacated the class certification order and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. In June 2024, 3M was named as a defendant in a new putative nationwide class action by the same named plaintiff who filed the Ohio suit that was dismissed and is described above. The new suit was brought against only 3M and DuPont entities and seeks to establish a putative class of anyone subject to the laws of Ohio or subject to the law of states that recognize the claims for relief filed by plaintiffs with blood serum levels of 2 ppb or more of PFOS and PFOA (combined) manufactured by defendants. 3M was served with the suit in July 2024, and subsequently filed a motion to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL, which was denied in October 2024. 
 In Virginia, in August 2024, 3M was named as a defendant in a case alleging that plaintiff s decedent, a civilian firefighter, died from cancer allegedly caused by exposure to PFAS from turnout gear. 3M has not yet responded to the complaint.

 In Michigan, 3M previously settled claims brought by Wolverine World Wide (Wolverine) related to Wolverine s alleged use of 3M Scotchgard in its shoe manufacturing operations. 3M continues to incur liabilities for immaterial amounts pursuant to the settlement agreement. 
 Other PFAS-related Matters 
 At its Greystone, Wisconsin facility where the Company conducts mining operations, the tap water available for consumption on the grounds was recently sampled and tested, and the level of certain PFAS exceeded the state's maximum contaminant level. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ("DNR") in October 2023 instructed the plant to notify potential drinking water users on the grounds of the plant and indicated that a notice of violation would be issued to the plant. The Company made the required notifications on October 24, 2023. On January 9, 2024, the Company received a Notice of Violation and Enforcement Conference from the Wisconsin DNR. Following discussions, the Company entered into a consent order with the Wisconsin DNR in June 2024 regarding the installation of a treatment system for the supply well by March 2026 as the appropriate corrective actions. The Company is in the process of designing the treatment system for installation on the well.

 perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at the Decatur site that prohibits release of these materials into the waters of the United States. In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and treating all air emissions. These processes are no longer in use. 
 The Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to an NPDES permit issued by ADEM. In June 2019, as previously reported, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM. In addition, as previously reported, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM and temporarily idled certain manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur and installed wastewater treatment controls. 
 As previously reported, in December 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Northern District of Alabama for documents related to, among other matters, the Company s compliance with the 2009 TSCA consent order and unpermitted discharges to the Tennessee River from its Decatur facility. The Company continues to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney s Office, the U.S. Department of Justice and the EPA with respect to this issue. 
 3M and ADEM agreed to the terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Company s Decatur facility. Under the interim Consent Order, the Company s principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a) providing notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation activities, including on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. As offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and reasonably estimable.

 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the cleaning up of approximately miles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to design and pay the estimated million cost to remove and cap sediment containing chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Company s involvement in the case relates to its past use of commercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined.

 liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those matters is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time. The Company s environmental liabilities and insurance receivables are described below. 
 Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables 
 The Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and reasonably estimable based on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including discussions regarding negotiated resolutions. During the first nine months of 2024, primarily as a result of interest accretion on the PWS Settlement, the Company increased its accrual for PFAS-related other environmental liabilities by billion and made related payments of billion. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded liabilities of billion for other environmental liabilities. These amounts are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet within other current liabilities billion) and other liabilities billion). The accruals represent the Company s estimate of the probable loss in connection with the environmental matters and PFAS-related matters and litigation described above. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had recorded liabilities of million for estimated non-PFAS related environmental remediation costs to clean up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company s commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to years. 
 It is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Company s current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Company s operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both environmental remediation liabilities and other environmental liabilities, at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above. 
 The Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. During the third quarter of 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reflected million in insurance recovery benefits related to the environmental matters and litigation. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of insurance recoveries, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.

 plaintiffs for the first bellwether trial, which began in March 2021. 
 Aearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms Version 2 Earplugs starting in about 1999. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless, as discussed below, prior to the CAE Settlement (as defined below), Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (collectively, the "Aearo Entities") and 3M faced litigation from a significant number of claimants. In July 2022, the Aearo Entities voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation associated with these matters. 3M entered into an agreement with the Aearo Entities to fund this trust and to support the Aearo Entities in connection with the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M committed billion to fund this trust and committed an additional billion to fund projected related case expenses. Related to these actions, 3M reflected a pre-tax charge of billion (within selling, general and administrative expenses), inclusive of fees and net of related existing accruals, in the second quarter of 2022. 
 As a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a charge that was not material to 3M. Following various pleadings, in June 2023, the Bankruptcy Court granted a motion by plaintiffs to dismiss the bankruptcy proceeding. As a result of this dismissal, 3M reconsolidated the former deconsolidated Aearo Entities, in the second quarter of 2023, resulting in an immaterial income statement impact. 
 In August 2023, 3M and the Aearo Entities entered into a settlement arrangement (as amended, the CAE Settlement which is structured to promote participation by claimants and is intended to resolve, to the fullest extent possible, all litigation and alleged claims involving the Combat Arms Earplugs sold or manufactured by the Aearo Entities and/or 3M, as well as potential future claims. 
 Pursuant to the CAE Settlement, 3M will contribute up to a total amount of billion between 2023 and 2029. The actual amount, payment terms and dates are subject to satisfaction of certain collective participation thresholds claimants must meet and provision to 3M of a full release of claims involving the Combat Arms Earplugs. The CAE Settlement was originally structured to include billion in cash consideration and billion in 3M common stock. The Company in its sole discretion could have elected to settle the equity portion in cash. In January 2024, 3M and the Aearo Entities amended the settlement to include, among other things, an irrevocable election by 3M to pay cash for the billion in payments that could have been paid either in cash or in stock. 
 The CAE Settlement provides that 3M does not admit any liability or wrongdoing. As a result of the CAE Settlement, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of billion in the third quarter of 2023. The charge reflected the billion pre-tax present value (discounted at an estimated interest rate at time consummation) of contributions under the CAE Settlement net of 3M s then-existing accrual of billion related to this matter.

 million to fund administrative expenses connected to the settlement and paid million in exchange for releases from certain bellwether plaintiffs that obtained a verdict against 3M and the Aearo defendants. 3M paid million in December 2023 related to the receipt of expedited releases, and made a payment of an additional million on January 31, 2024 based on 100 participation level of "wave" case claimants. On March 26, 2024, the Company announced that, as of the final registration date for the CAE settlement agreement, more than of claimants were either participating in the settlement or have been dismissed with prejudice. With a participation threshold having been met, the Company made a million payment on April 15, 2024, and a million payment on July 15, 2024, pursuant to the payment schedule set forth in the amended settlement agreement. The current participation level (including claims dismissed with prejudice) exceeds . The Company made a million payment pursuant to the settlement on October 15, 2024. 
 All MDL court cases for the bellwether plaintiffs have been dismissed and all relevant appeals before the Seventh Circuit and Eleventh Circuit have been dismissed. As a result, in September 2024, 3M and the Aearo Entities agreed to terminate the Aearo bankruptcy funding agreement described above. 
 In addition, Aearo and the Company are actively engaged in insurance recovery activities to offset a portion of the settlement payments. Formal recovery processes are underway through a lawsuit filed in Delaware, as well as arbitration proceedings. 
 During the third quarter of 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reflected million and million, respectively, of benefits from insurance recoveries related to the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Through September 30, 2024, the Company has reflected million in total insurance recovery benefits related to the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Pursuant to the CAE Settlement, these insurance recoveries are provided to the Qualified Settlement Fund as part of the consideration for the settlement. 
 billion for interest accretion on the CAE Settlement and made the related payments noted above of approximately billion. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accrued liability of billion related to Combat Arms Earplugs. This amount is reflected within contingent liability claims and other billion within other current liabilities and billion within other liabilities) on 3M s consolidated balance sheet. The accruals represent the Company s estimate of the probable loss in connection with the CAE Settlement. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time. 
 
 and after having completed of service. This retiree-eligible population represents percent of the annual grant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is typically recognized in the first quarter. However, due to the spin-off of Solventum (see Note 2), the 2024 annual grant was made in May, after the April 1, 2024 separation. 
 In addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. The Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. The cash settled grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the Company, and not included in the tables below. 
 In connection with the Solventum separation on April 1, 2024 (see Note 2), all outstanding stock-based compensation awards associated with Solventum employees converted into Solventum awards, became Solventum s responsibility and were cancelled from 3M plans. The conversion into Solventum awards was made with the intent to preserve the intrinsic value of each award immediately before and after the Separation. In addition, for awards associated with remaining 3M employees, the number of shares underlying unvested stock awards was adjusted along with the exercise price and the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options. These adjustments were made with the intent to preserve the intrinsic value of each award immediately before and after the Separation and were determined using a ratio calculated using the 3M share price based on the market closing price before and the average of the closing price from the first three days of trading after the Separation. The terms of the outstanding awards remain the same and if unvested, continue to vest over the original vesting periods. The adjustments to shares underlying unvested stock awards and outstanding stock options did not result in a material stock-based compensation cost.

 business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M s business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown. 
 3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in Corporate and Unallocated and Other ). 
 3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented. 
 Effective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following: 
 Elimination of former Health Care business segment 
 The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements. 
 Addition of Other and update to Corporate and Unallocated 
 3M added the Other category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects: 
 Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures. 
 Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures. 
 Activity included in 3M s existing Corporate and Unallocated was updated primarily to additionally reflect: 
 Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations. 
 Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M. 
 Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in Other associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.

 Performance by Business Segment 
 Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results 
 The term "N/M" used herein references "not meaningful" for certain percent changes. 
 Forward-looking statements in Part I, Item 2 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results in Part I, Item 2 and the risk factors provided in Part II, Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties). 
 
 Overview 
 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. Certain changes are reflective in this document for all applicable periods presented. These include: 
 As discussed in Note 2, on April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business (the Separation) through a pro rata distribution of 80.1 of the outstanding shares of Solventum Corporation (Solventum) to 3M stockholders. As a result of the Separation, Solventum became an independent public company and 3M no longer consolidates Solventum into 3M s financial results. In connection with the Separation, the historical net income of Solventum and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation are reported in 3M's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. 
 3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024 as further described in Note 19. To the extent these changes impacted 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue information, data in Note 3 has also been updated.

 3M manages its continuing operations in three operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction and, beginning April 2024, include the impact of commercial agreements associated with the separation of Solventum. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends. 
 3M is impacted by certain special items such as costs for significant litigation and the sales and income associated with manufactured PFAS products. See Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items, including references therein to where further information is provided. 
 Additional information regarding certain items impacting pre-2024 periods that may also be relevant in 2024 can be found in the Overview section of Part II, Item 7 as well as in further sections of 3M s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share attributable to 3M common shareholders diluted: The following table provides the increases (decreases) in diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share.

 The Company refers to various "adjusted" amounts or measures on an adjusted" basis. These exclude special items. These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below. 
 A discussion related to the components of year-on-year changes in earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share follows: 
 
 Total organic growth/productivity and other: 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the following components impacted operating margins and earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share year-on-year: 
 Benefits from organic growth, continued productivity and restructuring resulted in a net year-on-year increase of 0.12 per share 
 Income from transition service agreements with Solventum (refer to Note 2 for additional discussion) resulted in a net year-on-year increase of 0.01 per share 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 For the first nine months of 2024, the following components impacted operating margins and earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share year-on-year: 
 Benefits from organic growth, productivity, strong spending discipline and restructuring resulted in a net year-on-year increase of 0.79 per share 
 Nonrecurring items including gain on property sales resulted in a net year-on-year increase of 0.08 per share. 
 Income from transition services agreements with Solventum (refer to Note 2 for additional discussion) resulted in a net year-on-year increase of 0.05 per share 
 Restructuring and related charges: 
 3M recorded restructuring pre-tax charges of 40 million and 178 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 58 million and 310 million in the same periods last year, respectively, (refer to Note 6 for additional discussion). In addition, 3M recorded certain related pre-tax adjustments, accelerated depreciation and other charges of 8 million and 34 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. 
 Foreign exchange impacts: 
 Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income from continuing operations by approximately 18 million (or a decrease of pre-tax income from continuing operations by approximately 25 million) year-on-year for the third quarter of 2024 and decreased operating income from continuing operations by approximately 91 million (or a decrease of pre-tax income from continuing operations by approximately 107 million) year-on-year for the first nine months of 2024. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
 Acquisitions/divestitures: 
 Impacts relate to: 
 Divestiture impacts include the effect of new commercial agreements associated with the April 2024 separation of Solventum. 
 Reconsolidation of Aearo entities - in the third quarter of 2022, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities and, in the second quarter of 2023, reconsolidated those entities (discussed in Note 17). For each of the 12-months post-deconsolidation and post-reconsolidation, impacts are each reflected separately as divestiture and acquisition, respectively. 
 Other expense (income), net: 
 Interest expense (net of interest income) included in other expense (income), net as presented above decreased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period year-on-year. 
 Lower income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense increased expense year-on-year for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. 
 Income tax rate: 
 Certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 20.3 percent on a pre-tax income, compared to 23.5 percent on pre-tax loss in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 19.0 percent, compared to 24.3 percent in the prior year. The primary factors that impacted the comparison of these rates year-over-year were the third quarter 2023 charge related to the settlement agreement to resolve CAE litigation (see Note 17), second quarter 2023 charge related to the settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (see Note 17), and the tax rate associated with the 2024 benefit related to the change in value of the retained ownership interest in Solventum. 
 On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 20.5 and 20.1 , respectively, a decrease of 4.3 percentage points and a decrease of 1.1 percentage points, respectively, compared to the same period year-on-year. 
 Shares of common stock outstanding: 
 Shares outstanding impacted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share year-on-year.

 Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures): In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 3M also provides certain non-GAAP measures. These measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 Certain measures adjust for the impacts of special items. Special items for the periods presented include the items described in the section entitled Description of special items . Because 3M provides certain information with respect to business segments, it is noteworthy that special items impacting operating income (loss) are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, except as described with respect to net costs for significant litigation and manufactured PFAS products items in the Description of special items section. The reconciliations below, therefore, also include impacted segments as applicable. 
 This document contains measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a non-GAAP measure adjusted for special items. The document also contains additional measures which are not defined under U.S. GAAP. These measures and reasons 3M believes they are useful to investors (and, as applicable, used by 3M) include:

 Special items for the periods presented include: 
 Net costs for significant litigation: 
 These relate to 3M's respirator mask/asbestos (which include Aearo and non-Aearo items), PFAS-related other environmental, and Combat Arms Earplugs matters (as discussed in Note 17). Net costs include the impacts of changes in accrued liabilities (including interest imputation on applicable settlement obligations), external legal fees, and insurance recoveries, along with the associated tax impacts. Associated tax impacts of significant litigation include impacts on Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI), foreign tax credits and tax costs of repatriation. 3M does not consider the elements of the net costs associated with these matters to be normal, operating expenses related to the Company s ongoing operations, revenue generating activities, business strategy, industry, and regulatory environment. Net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos are reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment while those impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters are reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023 see Note 17), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected in corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected as part of special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. 
 Divestiture costs: 
 These include certain limited costs that were not eligible to be included within discontinued operations related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture. As a result of completion of the April 2024 separation of Solventum, this includes the tax cost of update to 3M s previous indefinite reinvestment plans on past unrepatriated earnings through the period of the Separation s close and to tax positions retained by 3M. 
 Manufactured PFAS products: 
 These amounts relate to sales and estimates of income (loss) regarding manufactured PFAS products that 3M plans to exit by the end of 2025 included within the Transportation and Electronics business segment. Along with other costs in arriving at this associated income, these amounts include estimates of costs of sales of 210 million and 348 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 626 million and 857 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Estimated income does not contemplate impacts on non-operating items such as net interest income/expense and the non-service cost components portion of defined benefit plan net periodic benefit costs.

 Russia exit charges/benefits: 
 In the second quarter of 2023, 3M recorded a gain on final disposal of net assets in Russia. Previously, in the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a charge primarily related to impairment of these assets in connection with management's committed exit and disposal plan. 
 Pension risk transfer charge: 
 In the second quarter of 2024, 3M recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge reflected in other expense (income), net as a result of transferring a portion of its U.S. pension payment obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company (as discussed in Note 13).

 Cost of Sales: Cost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were primarily due to ongoing manufacturing productivity initiatives and lower raw materials and energy costs, along with lower year-on-year restructuring charges. See also Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations subsection further below. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: SG A, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were primarily impacted by a 10.3 billion pre-tax charge related to the PWS settlement and the 4.2 billion pre-tax charge related to the CAE settlement in the second and third quarters of 2023 respectively (both discussed in Note 17). SG A in 2024 was also impacted by lower year-on-year restructuring charges. See also Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations subsection further below. 
 
 Research, Development and Related Expenses: R D, measured as a percent of sales, was consistent in the third quarter and decreased in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the same period last year. 3M continues to invest in a range of R D activities from application development, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations. See also Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations subsection further below. 
 
 Gain on Business Divestitures: In 2023, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of 36 million related to the sale of assets associated with its dental local anesthetic business net of a previous contingent indemnification obligation from a 2020 divestiture. 
 
 Other Expense (Income), Net: See Note 7 for a detailed breakout of this line item. 
 Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in the third quarter compared to the same period last year due to the pay down of debt maturities and additional interest income from increased cash balances. Interest expense (net of interest income) increased in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year primarily driven by the addition of imputed interest associated with the obligations resulting from the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement in the second and third quarters of 2023 respectively (discussed in Note 17) partially offset by additional interest income. 
 The non-service pension and postretirement net benefit decreased approximately 33 million in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased approximately 869 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, largely due to the 795 million second quarter 2024 pension settlement charge as a result of transferring a portion of U.S. pension payment obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company (see Note 13). 
 See also Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations subsection further below. 
 Solventum ownership - change in value resulted in a year-on-year benefit of 0.6 billion and 1.7 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, following Solventum's separation from 3M in April 2024 (discussed in Note 2).

 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The primary noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M s effective ownership is 75 percent. 
 
 Certain Expenses Impacting Multiple Line Items within Results of Operations: 
 Stock compensation expense is discussed in Note 18 and impacts cost of sales, SG A, and R D. As note therein, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the quarter in which 3M s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made because of accounting rules for grants to employees that are retiree-eligible. Typically, the annual grant is made in the first quarter. However, due to the spin-off of Solventum (see Note 2), the 2024 annual grant was made in May, after the April 1, 2024 separation. 
 Defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for continuing operations (which impacts cost of sales, SG A, and R D) for the first nine months of 2024 was 148 million compared to 167 million in same period last year (as discussed in Note 13). The non-service cost component of pension and postretirement service cost impacts the other expense (income), net line item. For total year 2024, considering the remeasurements of U.S. pension and postretirement pension plans and second quarter 2024 795 million pension settlement charge associated the pension risk transfer special item (all discussed in Note 13), 3M estimates full year 2024 continuing operations defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense to total approximately 195 million while continuing operations non-service pension and postretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a charge of approximately 825 million, for a total estimated continuing operations consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of approximately 1,025 million. These amounts reflect a decrease of 27 million and an increase of 933 million in the service and non-service cost components, respectively. 
 For total year 2023 on a comparable continuing operations basis, the Company recognized defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense of 222 million and a benefit of 108 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total continuing operations defined benefit pension and postretirement expense of 114 million. 
 For 2025, 3M preliminarily expects a year-on-year non-service pension and postretirement expense tailwind of approximately 720 million, primarily as a result of the second quarter 2024 pension risk transfer charge special item (see Note 13 and section entitled Description of special items ). Adjusting for this 2024 special item, 3M expects a year-on-year headwind of approximately 70 million primarily due to amortization of prior service costs and impacts from previously deferred asset losses. These estimates are based on assumptions from 3M's most recent remeasurements of applicable plans carrying over to the year-end 2024 measurement. 
 The Company continues to make investments in the implementation of new business systems and solutions, including enterprise resource planning, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG A, and R D.

 Performance by Business Segment 
 Item 1, Business Segments within 3M's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, provides an overview of 3M s business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M s business segments are provided in Note 19. As discussed in Note 19, 3M made changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer.

 The preceding table also displays business segment operating income (loss) information adjusted for special items. For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023 see Note 17), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated see Note 19 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details. 
 
 Third quarter 2024 results: 
 Sales in Safety and Industrial were up 0.5 percent in U.S. dollars. 
 On an organic sales basis: 
 Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and electrical markets, were flat in industrial specialties and automotive aftermarket, and decreased in abrasives and personal safety. 
 Growth primarily came from industrial adhesives and tapes driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices and from growth in roofing granules and electrical markets. 
 Business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year driven by cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum, partially offset by benefits from organic growth and productivity. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as displayed above. 
 
 First nine months 2024 results: 
 Sales in Safety and Industrial were down 0.5 percent in U.S. dollars. 
 On an organic sales basis: 
 Sales increased in roofing granules and industrial adhesives and tapes, were flat in personal safety and electrical markets, and decreased in industrial specialties, abrasives and automotive aftermarket. 
 Industrial end market demand remained mixed as end user and channel remain cautious. Growth primarily came from industrial adhesives and tapes driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs. 
 Business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from productivity actions and strong spending discipline, partially offset by cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.

Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details. 
 
 Third quarter 2024 results: 
 Sales in Transportation and Electronics were down 1.5 percent in U.S. dollars. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), sales were up 1.8 percent in U.S. dollars. 
 On an organic sales basis: 
 Sales increased in electronics and commercial branding and transportation, and decreased in advanced materials and automotive and aerospace. 
 Growth was held back by headwinds related to PFAS manufactured products. 
 Growth primarily came from electronics as consumer electronics OEM customers ramped production volumes ahead of the upcoming holiday season. Automotive and aerospace was negatively impacted by decline in automotive OEM build rates partially offset by growth in aerospace driven by bonding and acoustic solutions. 
 Acquisitions: 
 Impacts related to reconsolidation of Aearo entities are included in Transportation and Electronics. 
 In the third quarter of 2022, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities and, in the second quarter of 2023, reconsolidated those entities (discussed in Note 17). For each of the 12-months post-deconsolidation and post-reconsolidation, impacts are each reflected separately as divestiture and acquisition, respectively. 
 Business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year driven by benefits from organic growth and productivity, partially offset by cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as displayed above.

 Acquisitions/divestitures: 
 Divestiture and acquisition impacts relate to lost/gained Transportation and Electronics sales year-on-year from the Aearo Entities. In the third quarter of 2022, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities and, in the second quarter of 2023, reconsolidated those entities (discussed in Note 17). For each of the 12-months post-deconsolidation and post-reconsolidation, impacts are each reflected separately as divestiture and acquisition, respectively. 
 Business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year driven by benefits from strong leverage on organic growth, productivity actions, and strong spending discipline, partially offset by cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above. 
 
 Consumer Business: 
 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales (millions) 1,299 1,315 3,702 3,800 Sales change analysis: Organic sales (0.7) (2.0) Translation (0.5) (0.6) Total sales change (1.2) (2.6) Business segment operating income (millions) 263 269 698 683 Percent change (2.5) 2.2 Percent of sales 20.2 20.5 18.9 18.0 
 
 Third quarter 2024 results: 
 Sales in Consumer were down 1.2 percent in U.S. dollars. 
 On an organic sales basis: 
 Sales increased in home improvement, and decreased in home and auto care, packaging and expression and consumer safety and well-being. 
 Growth was led by home improvement driven by Command s new product introductions for the back-to-school and holiday seasons. The remaining divisions within the Consumer business declined due to portfolio prioritization actions as well as retail customers continuing to be price sensitive and value focused. 
 Growth was negatively impacted by continued softness in consumer discretionary spending for hard goods along with product portfolio and geographic prioritization. 
 Business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year driven by organic growth declines and headwinds from cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. 
 
 First nine months 2024 results: 
 Sales in Consumer were down 2.6 percent in U.S. dollars. 
 On an organic sales basis: 
 Sales increased in home improvement, and decreased in home and auto care, packaging and expression and consumer safety and well-being. 
 Growth was negatively impacted by continued softness in consumer discretionary spending along with product portfolio and geographic prioritization. 
 Business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year from benefits from productivity actions, portfolio initiatives, and strong spending discipline, partially offset by decline in organic growth and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum.

 Corporate and Unallocated and Other: Outside of 3M's reportable operating segments, 3M has Corporate and Unallocated and Other which are not reportable business segments as they do not meet the segment reporting criteria. Because Corporate and Unallocated and Other include a variety of miscellaneous items, they are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. Corporate and Unallocated and Other are presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. 
 Corporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes corporate special items and other corporate expense-net . 
 Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023 see Note 17), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items for the periods presented also include divestiture costs and Russia exit costs/ benefits. Divestiture costs include costs that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture. 
 Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased year-over-year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily due to lower net costs for significant litigation associated with Corporate and Unallocated. 
 Other corporate expense-net includes certain enterprise and governance activities resulting in unallocated corporate costs and other activity and net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations, commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation, and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M. 
 Other corporate operating expenses, net, decreased year-over-year in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily due to the extent of non-discontinued operations-eligible former Solventum-allocated costs included in Corporate and Unallocated prior to Solventum's April 2024 Separation. 
 Other: 
 This category principally reflects activity associated with: 
 Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures. 
 Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures. 
 Operating income categorized as "Other" were similar year-over-year in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased year-over-year in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses. 
 Operating Business Segments: Information related to 3M s business segments is presented in the tables that follow with additional context in the corresponding narrative below the tables. 
 
 Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 The strength and stability of 3M s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy capital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3M s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 9 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.

 3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of 5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Total debt: The strength of 3M s credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of the date of this report, 3M has a credit rating of A3, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating of BBB+, negative outlook from S P Global Ratings, and a credit rating of A-, stable outlook from Fitch. 
 The Company s total debt associated with continuing operations at September 30, 2024 decreased when compared to December 31, 2023 as a result of 2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of 1.1 billion of medium-term notes and 1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Amounts borrowed by Solventum during the first quarter of 2024 were a liability associated with discontinued operations and, as transferred obligations, became the sole responsibility of Solventum after the April 1, 2024 Separation, as discussed in Note 12. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section. 
 Effective February 8, 2023, the Company renewed its well-known seasoned issuer (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M s previous WKSI shelf registration dated February 10, 2020. The Company has issued debt securities under a WKSI shelf in August 2019 and March 2020. 3M also has a medium-term notes program (Series F) program, originally established in 2016, up to an aggregate principal amount of 18 billion. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of debt issued under the (Series F) program is approximately 17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). The Company has not issued any debt under the (Series F) program since February 2019 and does not intend to issue any additional debt under this program in the future. 
 Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12. 
 In May 2023, 3M entered into a 4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2028; the facility was amended in July and September 2023. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to 1.0 billion (at lender s discretion), bringing the total facility up to 5.25 billion. The agreement replaced the amended and restated 3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement and the 1.25 billion 364-day credit facility that would have expired in November 2024 and November 2023, respectively. The credit facility was undrawn at September 30, 2024. Under the 4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At September 30, 2024, 3M was in compliance with this requirement. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. 
 The Company also had 343 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: At September 30, 2024, 3M had 7.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately 5.3 billion was held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries and approximately 2.0 billion was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high quality securities. At December 31, 2023, 3M had 5.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately 3.1 billion was held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries and 2.7 billion was held by the United States. The increase from December 31, 2023 was driven by 8.4 billion in proceeds from debt (primarily related to Solventum's issuance of debt prior to the Separation as discussed in Note 12) partially offset by approximately 4.5 billion in payments associated with PFAS-related other environmental liabilities and the CAE legal settlement (both discussed in Note 17 - note also the "Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations" section further below) and debt maturities.

Table of Contents 

 Net Debt (non-GAAP measure): Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities all on a continuing operations basis. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The table below provides net debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 (Millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Total debt 13,189 16,035 (2,846) Less: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 7,315 5,805 1,510 Net debt (non-GAAP measure) 5,874 10,230 (4,356) 
 Refer to the preceding Total Debt and Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities sections for additional details. 
 
 Balance Sheet: 3M s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 
 The Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity. 
 Working capital (non-GAAP measure): 
 (Millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change Current assets 16,299 16,379 (80) Less: Current liabilities 11,391 15,297 (3,906) Working capital (non-GAAP measure) 4,908 1,082 3,826 
 Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health. 
 Working capital increased 3.8 billion compared with December 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower balances of current liabilities principally of discontinued operations, short-term borrowings and current portions of long-term debt, and current liabilities relating to the PWS settlement (discussed in Note 17). 
 
 Cash Flows: Discussions of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the sections that follow. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include the results of continuing and discontinued operations and, therefore, also include cash and cash equivalents associated with Solventum through its April 2024 separation from 3M that were presented in current assets of discontinued operations in the 3M Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities: 
 Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as working capital movements, tax timing differences and other items such as litigation payments can significantly impact cash flows. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 4.7 billion compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by approximately 4.5 billion in payments associated with PFAS-related other environmental liabilities and the CAE legal settlement (both discussed in Note 17). The 2023 pre-tax charges of 10.3 billion related to the PWS Settlement and of 4.2 billion related to the CAE settlement largely impacted the net income component within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities: 
 Investments in property, plant and equipment (PP E) enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3M invested 890 million on PP E in the first nine months of 2024. 
 3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.

Table of Contents 

 Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus investments in equity securities. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities: 
 
 Debt cash flow activity includes proceeds from Solventum's issuance of 8.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt in the first quarter of 2024 partially offset by 2.9 billion in debt maturities, consisting of 1.1 billion of medium-term notes and 1.8 billion repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Gross commercial paper issuances and repayments, in addition to repayments of the fixed-rate notes are largely reflected in Proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) and "Repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days)". The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.8 billion commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023. 3M s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt. 
 
 Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In the first nine months of 2024, the Company purchased 1,096 million of its own stock. For more information, refer to the table titled Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 2. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company s stock. 
 
 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2024, 3M s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2024 dividend of 1.51 per share. In May 2024, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2024 dividend of 0.70 per share resetting 3M's dividend post-Solventum spin. In August 2024, 3M's Board of Directors declared a third-quarter 2024 dividend of 0.70 per share. 
 Cash flows from financing activity in 2024 also include 0.6 billion of net cash transferred to Solventum associated with the close of the Separation (discussed in Note 2). 
 Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations: See the Financial Condition and Liquidity - Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations section of Item 7 of 3M's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 In the context of Item 3, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition. For a discussion of sensitivity analysis related to these types of market risks, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in 3M's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in information that would have been provided in the context of Item 3 from the end of the preceding year until September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 a. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 b. There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 The Company continues to implement new business systems and solutions, including an enterprise resource planning system (ERP), which are expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related business processes. These implementations are expected to occur on an on-going basis as opportunities and needs are identified and addressed. The implementations, in certain cases, may affect the processes that constitute the Company s internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness. 
 The Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the United States, and will continue the implementations over the next several years. As with any new information technology application the Company implements, these applications, along with the internal control over financial reporting included in these processes, were appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. The Company concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the implementation in these circumstances has not materially affected its internal control over financial reporting. 
 In connection with the Separation, there were several processes, policies, operations, technologies and information systems that were transferred or separated. Through the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to take steps to ensure that adequate controls were designed and maintained throughout this transition period.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Discussion of legal matters is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1, Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Risks Related to the Global Economy and External Conditions 
 The Company s results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company derived approximately 55 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. Accordingly, the Company s operations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as, among other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, terrorism, public health emergencies, political changes and trends such as protectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the Company operates. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could adversely impact the Company's business and operations around the world. The Company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings; and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate. For example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks, such as lower economic growth rates in China, Europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the Company's products. 
 The global economy has been impacted by military conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022 and completed a sale of the related assets in June 2023. These geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, higher energy and other commodity costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain. 
 Climate change and severe weather events, including related environmental and social regulations, as well as natural disasters, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, compliance costs, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers or customers operate. 
 Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. 
 The Company s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as noted above, the Company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from outside the United States. As a result, the Company s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies, and the Company's results of operations may experience volatility related to changes in exchange rates. For a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, see Part I, Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 
 The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results. 
 As previously reported, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as PFAS, including some presently or historically produced by the Company. 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 The PFAS group of substances contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical, and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS substances critical to the manufacture of a wide range of products, including electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent contamination of medical products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. 3M is just one of a number of companies that manufacture PFAS compounds. 
 As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that certain PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that it would voluntarily phase out production of two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. Most of the phase out activities in the United States were completed by the end of 2002. The phase out included materials used to produce certain repellents and surfactant products, and products including Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and certain coatings for food packaging, for example. Following the phase out of PFOA and PFOS production, the Company has continued to review, control, or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts of some of 3M s current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams. 
 3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions with respect to PFAS (2022 PFAS Announcement): exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3M continues to make progress toward these goals, as discussed further below. The Company recognized a 0.8 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with the 2022 PFAS Announcement related to asset impairments, and will incur additional expenses in connection with the 2022 PFAS Announcement. In addition, the 2022 PFAS Announcement involves risks, including: the actual timing, costs, and financial impact of such exit; the Company s ability to complete such exit on the anticipated timing or at all; potential governmental or regulatory actions relating to PFAS or the Company s exit plans; the Company s ability to identify and manufacture, or procure from third parties if possible, acceptable substitutes for PFAS-containing materials in 3M's supply chain; the possibility that such non-PFAS options are not available or that such substitutes may not achieve the anticipated or desired commercial, financial or operational results; potential litigation relating to the Company s exit plans or to any products that include third-party manufactured materials containing PFAS that are incorporated into the products the Company sells; and the possibility that the planned exit will involve greater costs than anticipated, may not be feasible, may not be feasible on the timeframe initially predicted, or may otherwise have negative impacts on the Company s relationships with its customers and other parties. 
 As stated above, 3M is progressing toward the exit of all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. 3M is also working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025 and has made progress in eliminating the use of PFAS across its product portfolio in a variety of applications. With respect to PFAS-containing products not manufactured by 3M in the Company's supply chains, the Company continues to evaluate the availability and feasibility of third-party products that do not contain PFAS. Depending on the availability and feasibility of such third-party products not containing PFAS, the Company continues to evaluate circumstances in which the use of PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties and used in certain applications in 3M s product portfolios, such as lithium ion batteries, printed circuit boards and certain seals and gaskets, all widely used in commerce across a variety of industries, and in some cases required by regulatory or industry standards, may or are expected to, depending on applications, continue beyond 2025. In other cases, regulatory approval, customer re-certification or re-qualification of substitutes or replacements to eliminate the use of PFAS manufactured by third parties may not be completed, or, depending on circumstances, are not expected to be completed, by the end of 2025. With respect to PFAS-containing products manufactured by third parties, the Company intends to continue to evaluate beyond the end of 2025 the adoption of third-party products that do not contain PFAS to the extent such products are available and such adoption is feasible. 
 3M has noticed several global regulatory trends related to PFAS, including decreasing emission standards and limits set for the presence of certain PFAS in various media, and the inclusion in regulatory activity of a broadening group of PFAS. Developments in these and other global regulatory trends may require additional actions by 3M, including investigation, remediation and compliance actions, and may result in additional litigation and enforcement action-related costs. 
 Under certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where substances designated as hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination under applicable environmental laws. As a result of the CERCLA designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in 2024, and to the extent EPA finalizes additional proposals related to PFAS, 3M may be required to undertake additional investigative or remediation activities, including where 3M conducts operations or where 3M has disposed of waste. 3M may also face additional litigation from other entities that have liability under these laws for claims seeking contribution for clean-up costs other entities might have.

 The Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their reviews of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company. 3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the AFFF multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions. Various factors or developments in these and other disclosed actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on 3M. For example, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of 897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. In addition, as described in greater detail in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2023, the Company entered into a class-action settlement PWS Settlement to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water suppliers in the United States regarding PFAS. The court approved that settlement in March 2024. 3M will pay 10.5 billion to 12.5 billion in total to resolve the claims released by the PWS Settlement, with payments to be made from 2024 through 2036, in exchange for a release of certain claims, as described further in Note 17. Unexpected events related to the PWS Settlement, including the potential impact of the PWS Settlement on other PFAS-related matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or its consolidated financial position. In addition, as previously disclosed, in connection with the separation of Solventum, the Company agreed to retain liabilities related to PFAS for certain products sold by Solventum for a limited period of time following the separation. 
 Governmental inquiries, lawsuits, or laws and regulations involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, including orders to conduct remediation, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities, requiring the installation of control technologies, suspension or shutdown of facility operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise, restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damages, and reporting requirements or bans on PFAS and PFAS-containing products manufactured by the Company. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or its consolidated financial position. 
 The Company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, as well as compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company or its suppliers, vendors, or channel partners to conduct business in a certain way. The outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, ability to execute its strategy and its results of operations. 
 The Company operates globally, including in some jurisdictions that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues, and is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, including those involving product liability; securities and corporate laws; antitrust and competition laws; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; laws and regulations that apply to industries served by the Company, including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, and the Sunshine Act; and other matters. The Company is also subject to compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company and its suppliers, vendors, or channel parties, to conduct business in a certain way. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Company s suppliers, vendors, or channel partners, or trade associations to which the Company belongs, have business practices that are inconsistent with 3M s Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements, or with legal requirements. 
 The Company or its third-party vendors may develop or incorporate artificial intelligence technology in certain business processes, services or products. The development and use of artificial intelligence may present risks to the Company s business. Also, the rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment relating to artificial intelligence, in the United States and internationally, could impact the Company s implementation of artificial intelligence technology, and increase compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. While the Company will seek to develop and use artificial intelligence responsibly, and will attempt to identify and mitigate ethical, privacy, legal or other issues presented by its use, there can be no assurance that the Company will be fully successful in doing so, and may be subject to data breaches, allegations of unauthorized access to, or use of, third party data, information, or intellectual property rights, or other risks, which may lead to financial losses, legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage.

 The failure to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations could result in significant civil fines and penalties or criminal sanctions against the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. These laws and regulations prohibit corrupt payments by the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents. The Company is also required to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls under the FCPA's accounting provisions. From time to time, the Company receives reports internally and externally, via various reporting channels deployed by its Ethics and Compliance function or otherwise (such as shareholder communications), about business and other activities that raise compliance or other legal or litigation issues. The Company has in the past, and in the future could be, required to investigate such reports and cooperate with U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities in such investigations, audit, monitor compliance or alter its practices as part of such investigations, and the Company has in the past and may in the future be required to pay fines or penalties related to its practices. While the Company maintains and implements U.S. and international compliance programs, including policies and procedures, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of noncompliance, the Company's employees, suppliers, vendors, channel partners or agents may violate such policies and procedures and engage in practices that contravene relevant laws and regulations. 
 The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the Company. In addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the Company s expectations, and have resulted and may in the future result in, one or more of the following: criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the extent to which the Company can conduct business; employee and business partner terminations due to policy violations; and private rights of action that result in litigation exposure, including expenses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the Company. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of these acts is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or cash flows or its consolidated financial position. In addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Company s reputation. The Company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the Company s intellectual property rights, or claims that the Company s activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the Company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the Company s reputation, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Risks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences 
 The Company s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. 
 Demand for the Company s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by, among other things, (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company s pricing strategies; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers, vendors, or channel partners; (iv) changes in customers preferences for our products, including preferences for products that do not contain PFAS, the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, block-chain, expanded analytics, and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data. 
 The Company s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. 
 This ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.

 The Company s future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, regulatory developments, natural disasters, and other disruptive factors. 
 The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts and severe weather events, natural and other disasters, and other disruptive events such as military conflicts, or be terminated. In addition, some of our suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, and stability of such suppliers and the Company's ability to source adequate alternatives in a cost-effective manner. Any sustained interruption in the Company s receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its ability to fulfill supply obligations to its customers. The Company could incur contractual penalties, experience a deterioration in customer relationships, or suffer harm to its reputation if the Company is unable to fulfill its obligations to customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing will be successful or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

 Risks Related to Our Business 
 The Company employs information including operational technology systems to support its business and to collect, store, and/or use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of its business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Network disruptions, security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the Company s information technology systems, networks and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the Company s operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the Company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely impact the Company s business, reputation, and results of operations. 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to artificial intelligence, privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Third parties and threat actors, including organized criminals, nation-state entities, and/or nation-state supported actors, regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Company s information and operational technology networks and infrastructure, data, and other information, and many such attempts are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity counter measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Company s information and operational technology systems, networks and infrastructure have experienced and are expected to experience cyberattacks of various degrees of sophistication, and are susceptible to insider threat, compromise, damage, disruption, or shutdown, including as a result of the exploitation of known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities, or zero day attacks, in our systems or the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers, the introduction of computer viruses, malware or ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, phishing attempts, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. The Company s increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the COVID-19 health pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to our information technology systems, networks and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity counter measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or a cyberattack to remain undetected for an extended time, up to and including several months, and the prioritization of decisions with respect to security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities that we and the vendors and other third parties upon which we rely make may prove inadequate to protect against these attacks. While we and third parties we utilize have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents that could lead to other disruptions of the Company s and the third parties' information and operational technology systems and infrastructure, we do not believe that any such cybersecurity incidents to date have had a material impact on the Company. Any cybersecurity incident or information or operational technology network disruption could result in numerous negative consequences, including the risk of legal claims or proceedings, investigations or enforcement actions by U.S., state, or foreign regulators; liabilities or penalties under applicable laws and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions; interference with the Company s operations; the incurrence of remediation costs; loss of intellectual property protection; the loss of customer, supplier, or employee relationships; and damage to the Company s reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Company s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs, damages, expenses or losses incurred will be fully insured. 
 Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other strategic events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies could affect future results. 
 The Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions and strategic alliances, future results will be affected by, as applicable, the Company s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies and the Company's ability to operationalize and derive anticipated benefits from alliances. Divestitures may include continued involvement in the divested businesses, such as through transitional or longer-term supply or distribution arrangements, following the transaction, and may result in unexpected liabilities through indemnification or other risk-shifting mechanisms in the applicable divestiture agreement. For example, in connection with the separation of Solventum, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements that provide for the performance of certain services or provision of goods by each company for the benefit of the other and that may result in unexpected liabilities related to indemnification obligations or non-performance by Solventum. A summary of the material terms of these agreements can be found in the section entitled Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions Agreements with 3M in Solventum s Information Statement, dated March 13, 2024, which was included as Exhibit 99.1 to Solventum s Current Report on 8-K filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company s future results.

 The Company s future results may be affected by its operational execution, including through organizational restructurings and scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than planned. 
 The Company s financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as continuous improvement, to improve productivity and reduce expenses and engages in ongoing global business transformation, including restructurings from time to time, to streamline its operations, improve operational efficiency, productivity, and the speed and efficiency with which it serves customers. Workforce restructuring activities impact business groups, functions, and geographies, and the structural reorganization is expected to reduce the size of the corporate center, simplify supply chain, streamline 3M's geographic footprint, reduce layers of management, further align business go-to-market models to customers, and reduce manufacturing roles to align with production volumes, with the goal of improving the Company's longer-term outlook in overall performance. There can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits of such activities, or that such activities will not result in unexpected or negative consequences, such as a reduced ability to generate sales; a relationship impact with employees; or a reduced ability to provide the experience that our customers, suppliers, vendors, and channel partners expect from us. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving customer needs and service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company s ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3M s brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters 
 The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results. 
 The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. 
 Change in the Company s credit ratings or increases in benchmark interest rates could increase cost of funding. 
 The Company s credit ratings are important to 3M s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. The Company s credit ratings have served to lower 3M s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. As of the date of this report, 3M has a credit rating of A3, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, a credit rating of BBB+, negative outlook from S P Global Ratings, and a credit rating of A-, stable outlook from Fitch. The addition of further leverage to the Company s capital structure could impact 3M s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings and further downgrades by the ratings agencies, would adversely affect the Company s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets. In addition, interest expense could increase due to a rise in interest rates. 
 Changes in tax rates, laws, or regulations could adversely impact our financial results. 
 The Company s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, and assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. or international tax reform legislation could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial results.

 Risks Related to the Company s Aearo Entities and Combat Arms Earplug Settlement 
 The Company is subject to risks related to the Company's Aearo Entities and CAE Settlement. 
 As previously disclosed, and as discussed further in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Aearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs starting in about 1999. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless faced significant litigation relating to the earplugs. In August 2023, the Company and the Aearo Entities entered into a settlement arrangement (as amended, the CAE Settlement which is structured to promote participation by claimants and is intended to resolve, to the fullest extent possible, all litigation and alleged claims involving the CAE sold or manufactured by the Aearo Entities and/or 3M. Pursuant to the CAE Settlement, 3M will contribute a total amount of 6.0 billion between 2023 and 2029. Payments to claimants are subject to certain conditions, including providing 3M with a full release of any and all claims involving the CAE. In March 2024, as of the final registration date for the CAE Settlement, more than 99 of claimants are participating in the settlement. The CAE Settlement is subject to risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, whether the anticipated full participation by plaintiffs in the CAE Settlement will be achieved, whether there will be a significant number of future claims by plaintiffs that decline to participate in the CAE Settlement, whether the CAE Settlement is appealed or challenged, the filing and outcome of additional litigation, if any, relating to the products that are the subject of the CAE Settlement, or changes in laws or regulations related to the CAE products or the CAE Settlement. 
 Risks Related to the Spin-off of Solventum, the Company s Former Health Care Business 
 The Company is subject to risks related to the separation of Solventum, the Company's former Health Care business, into an independent public company. 
 On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its health care business, which is known as Solventum Corporation, as an independent company. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related restructuring transactions) will not exceed the anticipated amounts, in each case in the amounts or within the timeframes that were anticipated. The separation may also impose challenges on the Company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the transaction; the impact on the Company s ability to retain talent; potential impacts on the Company s relationships with its customers, employees, regulators, and other counterparties; and the risk that any consents or approvals required will not be obtained or will be obtained subject to material modifications to the terms of the underlying arrangement. 
 In connection with the separation, the Company and Solventum entered into various agreements that provide for the performance of certain services or provision of goods by each company for the benefit of the other, including a separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a transition distribution services agreement, a transition contract manufacturing agreement, a stockholder s and registration rights agreement, an intellectual property cross license agreement, a master supply agreement, and a reverse master supply agreement. Performance under these agreement or other related conditions outside of the Company s control could materially affect our operations and future financial results. 
 Following the separation, the Company is a smaller, less diversified company than it was prior to the separation, which could make the Company more vulnerable to factors impacting its performance, such as changing market conditions and market volatility. In addition, the Company may be unable to find suitable alternatives for goods and services that Solventum temporarily provides to the Company pursuant to the agreements noted above, or such alternative goods and services may be more expensive than provided by Solventum to the Company. 
 The Company retained an equity interest in Solventum in connection with the spin-off. The Company cannot predict the trading price of shares of Solventum s common stock and the market value of the Solventum shares is subject to market volatility and other factors outside of the Company s control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Solventum within five years from the spin-off, but there can be no assurance regarding the timing of, or timeframe over which, such divestiture or divestitures may occur, or the amount of proceeds received by the Company in connection with any such divestitures. 
 In addition, while it is intended that the transaction be tax-free to the Company s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off is ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company, Solventum, or the Company s stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.

 Disclosure Under Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 
 The Company is making the following disclosure under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act: 
 Protection of Intellectual Property Rights in Iran Pursuant to Specific License 
 As part of its intellectual property IP protection efforts, 3M has obtained and maintains patents and trademarks in Iran. Periodically, 3M pays renewal fees, through third-party IP service providers/counsel, to the Iran Intellectual Property Office IIPO for these patents and trademarks and has sought to prosecute and defend such trademarks. On February 28, 2024, the Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC renewed 3M's specific license to make payments to IIPO at its account in Bank Melli, which was designated on November 5, 2018 by OFAC under its counter terrorism authority pursuant to Executive Order 13224. As authorized by OFAC s specific license, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , 3M paid 130 as part of its intellectual property protection efforts in Iran. 3M plans to continue these IP rights protection activities, as authorized under the specific license.
