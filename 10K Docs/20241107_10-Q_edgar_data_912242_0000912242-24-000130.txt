 The above derivatives were valued with an aggregate fair value (Level 2 measurement) and were included in other assets (other accrued liabilities). The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives was determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivatives. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. 
 Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate caps. As a result, the Company determined that its interest rate cap valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The total cost of the project is estimated to be between 240.0 million and 260.0 million, with 120.0 million to 130.0 million estimated to be the Company s pro rata share. The Company has incurred 7.8 million of the total 15.3 million incurred by the joint venture as of September 30, 2024. The anticipated opening is in 2027. 
 Other Transactions and Events:

The ATM Program was fully utilized as of September 30, 2024 and is no longer active. 
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources for a further discussion of the Company s anticipated liquidity needs, and the measures taken by the Company to meet those needs. 
 Inflation: 
 Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, the routine expiration of leases for spaces 10,000 square feet and under each year enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, most leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of property taxes and utilities. Inflation has had a negative impact on the Company's costs in 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company's significant accounting policies and estimates are described in more detail in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical. 

35 

Table of Contents 

 Acquisitions: 
 Upon the acquisition of real estate properties, the Company evaluates whether the acquisition is a business combination or asset acquisition. For both business combinations and asset acquisitions, the Company allocates the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities. For asset acquisitions, the Company capitalizes transaction costs and allocates the purchase price using a relative fair value method allocating all accumulated costs. For business combinations, the Company expenses transaction costs incurred and allocates purchase price based on the estimated fair value of each separately identified asset and liability. The Company allocates the estimated fair value of acquisitions to land, building, tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. In addition, any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of the land and buildings is determined utilizing an as if vacant methodology. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below-market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus any below-market fixed rate renewal options. Above or below-market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below-market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the Center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space. 
 Remeasurement gains are recognized when the Company becomes the primary beneficiary of an existing equity method investment that is a variable interest entity to the extent that the fair value of the existing equity investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment, and remeasurement losses are recognized to the extent the carrying value of the investment exceeds the fair value. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow model, with the significant unobservable inputs including discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and market rents. 
 Asset Impairment: 
 The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as capitalization rates and estimated holding periods. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable. Changes in events or changes in circumstances may alter the expected hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company s financial condition or operating performance. If the carrying value of the property exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over its estimated fair value. Properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 
 The estimated fair value of a property is typically determined through a discounted cash flow analysis or based upon a contracted sales price. The discounted cash flow method includes significant unobservable inputs including the discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and market rents. Cash flow projections and rates are subject to management s judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimation of fair value. 
 The Company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures apply the same accounting model for property level impairment as described above. Further, the Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability and valuation declines that are other-than-temporary. The Company records any such impairment up to the extent of its investment.

Table of Contents 

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 
 The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions. Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. 
 The Company recorded its financing arrangement (See Note 12 Financing Arrangement in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) obligation at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value being recorded as interest expense in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow model, with the significant unobservable inputs including discount rate, terminal capitalization rate, and market rents. The fair value of the financing arrangement obligation was sensitive to these significant unobservable inputs and a change in these inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred because of the transactions affecting the Company s properties described in Management s Overview and Summary above, including the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Centers and the Disposition Properties (as defined below). 
 For purposes of the discussion below, the Company defines Same Centers as those Centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Non-Same Centers for comparison purposes include those Centers or properties that are going through a substantial redevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the Center Redevelopment Properties ), those properties that have recently transitioned to or from equity method joint ventures to or from consolidated assets ("JV Transition Centers") and properties that have been disposed of Disposition Properties ). The Company moves a Center in and out of Same Centers based on whether the Center is substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Accordingly, the Same Centers consist of all Consolidated Centers, excluding the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Centers, Santa Monica Place and the Disposition Properties, for the periods of comparison. Santa Monica Place is excluded from Same Centers due to the Company's default on the non-recourse loan on April 9, 2024. 
 For the comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the JV Transition Centers are Arrowhead Towne Center, Chandler Fashion Center, South Plains Mall and the five former Sears parcels located at Chandler Fashion Center, Danbury Fair Mall, Freehold Raceway Mall, Los Cerritos Center and Washington Square (See Acquisitions in Management s Overview and Summary). The Disposition Properties are The Marketplace at Flagstaff, Superstition Springs Power Center, Towne Mall and a former department store parcel at Valle Vista Mall (See "Dispositions" in Management s Overview and Summary). For the comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Redevelopment Properties are Green Acres Mall and Fashion District Philadelphia. 
 Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company s pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 The Company considers tenant annual sales, occupancy rates (excluding large retail stores or Anchors and releasing spreads (i.e., a comparison of initial average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot at expiration for the leases expiring during the trailing twelve months based on the spaces 10,000 square feet and under) to be key performance indicators of the Company s internal growth.

Table of Contents 

 During the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, comparable tenant sales for spaces less than 10,000 square feet across the portfolio decreased by 1.0 relative to the third quarter of 2023. The leased occupancy rate of 93.7 at September 30, 2024 represented a 0.3 increase from 93.4 at September 30, 2023 and a 0.4 sequential increase compared to the 93.3 occupancy rate at June 30, 2024. Releasing spreads increased as the Company executed leases at an average rent of 66.98 for new and renewal leases executed compared to 59.86 on leases expiring, resulting in a releasing spread increase of 7.13 per square foot, or 11.9 , for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. This was the Company s twelfth consecutive quarter of positive base rent leasing spreads. 
 The Company continues to renew or replace leases that are scheduled to expire in 2024, however, due to a variety of factors, the Company cannot be certain of its ability to sign, renew or replace leases expiring in 2024 or beyond. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has executed renewal leases or commitments on 84 of its square footage expiring in 2024, which leases are expected to commence throughout 2024 and another 13 of such expiring space is in the letter of intent stage. Excluding those leases, the remaining leases expiring in 2024, which represent approximately 96,000 square feet of the Centers, are in the prospecting stage. 
 The Company has entered into 225 leases for new stores totaling approximately 1.6 million square feet that have opened or are planned for opening in 2024, and another 79 leases for new stores totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet opening throughout 2025 and 2026. In total, through 2027, new store leases are expected to produce incremental rent of approximately 79.8 million (at the Company s pro rata share) in excess of the rent generated from prior uses in the same spaces. While there may be additional new space openings in 2024, any such leases are not yet executed. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company signed 70 new leases and 150 renewal leases comprising approximately 831,000 square feet of GLA. The average tenant allowance was 24.31 per square foot. 
 Outlook 
 During March 2024, the Company celebrated its 30th anniversary as a public company and also welcomed Jackson Hsieh as its Chief Executive Officer and President. Following the appointment of Mr. Hsieh, the Company s leadership team has spent considerable time refining the Company's strategy and unveiled the Path Forward Plan during the second quarter of 2024. 
 The Path Forward Plan is a multi-pronged strategy to improve the Company's balance sheet, while also making inward-facing enhancements to both bolster company culture and improve key business processes to gain operating efficiencies. Essential goals of the Path Forward Plan include: 
 Deleverage the capital structure, with a focus on reducing the Company's Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio over the next three to four years; 
 Invest in and fortify the Company's key assets in the portfolio; 
 Proactively consolidate selected joint venture assets over time that are core to the Company's overall strategy; 
 Deliver a post-deleveraging Funds From Operations ("FFO") launch point goal over the next three to four years; 
 Achieve outstanding operational results through rigorous internal process improvements; and 
 Position the Company to take an offensive stance on acquisitions, reinvestment and selected development. 
 The Company may achieve these goals through a variety of methods and the timing, extent and impact of any transactions that the Company has or will undertake while implementing the Path Forward Plan are indeterminable at this time. In order to deleverage its capital structure, the Company may pursue asset dispositions and acquisitions, experience organic growth in EBITDA as tenants in its lease pipeline open for business, be selective about undertaking new development and redevelopment projects, and/or issue common stock. Asset sales will focus on whether a property is core to the Company s strategy and may include defaulting on certain mortgage debts on the Company s properties and giving possession of such secured properties to the lender. 
 Further, the Company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of regional retail centers. Although the majority of the key performance indicators at the Centers continued to improve during the first three quarters of 2024, operating results in 2024 have been and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by certain external factors, including any increase in inflation and elevated interest rates, as well as the impact from the recent bankruptcy of Express and any future tenant bankruptcies. 
 Traffic levels at the Company s Centers for the first three quarters of 2024 increased by 1.6 from 2023 levels for the same time period. Portfolio tenant sales per square foot from spaces less than 10,000 square feet for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 were 834 compared to 836 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Comparable tenant sales from

 spaces less than 10,000 square feet across the portfolio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.8 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 During 2023, the Company signed 839 new and renewal leases for approximately 4.2 million square feet, compared to 963 leases and 3.8 million square feet signed during 2022. This leasing volume represented a 13 decrease in the number of leases and a 12 increase in the amount of square footage leased compared to the same period in 2022 on a comparable basis, and was the highest volume leasing year in the Company s history. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company signed 220 leases for approximately 831,000 square feet, compared to 194 leases and 719,000 square feet leased during the third quarter of 2023, representing a 15.5 increase in the amount of square footage leased and a 13.4 increase in the number of leases signed on a comparable center basis. 
 The Company believes that diversity of use within its tenant base has been, and will continue to be, a prominent internal growth catalyst at its Centers going forward, as new uses enhance the productivity and diversity of the tenant mix and have the potential to significantly increase customer traffic at the applicable Centers. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company signed leases for new stores with new-to-Macerich portfolio uses for 71,000 square feet, with another 273,000 square feet of such new-to-Macerich portfolio leases currently in negotiation as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company signed leases for new stores with new-to-Macerich portfolio uses totaling over 600,000 square feet. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the leased occupancy rate was 93.7 , a 0.3 increase compared to the leased occupancy rate at September 30, 2023 of 93.4 and a 0.4 sequential increase compared to the 93.3 occupancy rate at June 30, 2024. 
 Many of the Company s leases contain co-tenancy clauses. Certain Anchor or small tenant closures have become permanent, whether caused by the pandemic or otherwise, and co-tenancy clauses within certain leases may be triggered as a result. The Company does not anticipate that the negative impact of such clauses on lease revenue will be significant. 
 The pace of bankruptcy filings involving the Company s tenants decreased substantially in 2023 and in 2022 compared to 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there were ten bankruptcy filings involving the Company s tenants totaling fifteen leases and representing approximately 111,000 square feet of leased space and 3.6 million of annual leasing revenue at the Company s share. Year-to-date in 2024, there have been nine bankruptcy filings involving the Company s tenants, including the bankruptcy of Express announced on April 22, 2024, totaling 45 leases and representing approximately 312,000 square feet of leased space and 18.4 million of annual leasing revenue at the Company s share. 
 During 2024, the Company expects to generate positive cash flow from operations after recurring operating capital expenditures, leasing capital expenditures and payment of dividends. This assumption does not include any potential capital generated from dispositions, refinancings or issuances of common stock. To the extent available, this expected surplus will be used to fund the Company s development and redevelopment pipeline and de-lever the Company s balance sheet. 
 The Company continues to actively address its near-term, non-recourse loan maturities, with eight completed transactions year-to-date in 2024 totaling approximately 1.3 billion, or approximately 1.1 billion at the Company s pro rata share. The Company has no remaining maturities in 2024. For additional information on the Company s financing transactions in the year ended 2023 through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, see Financing Activities in Management s Overview and Summary. 
 On April 9, 2024, the Company defaulted on the 300.0 million loan on Santa Monica Place and the Company is in negotiations with the lender on the terms of this non-recourse loan. 
 Elevated interest rates have increased, and may continue to increase, the cost of the Company s borrowings due to its outstanding floating-rate debt and have led, and may continue to lead, to higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. While interest rates have begun to decrease, they remain elevated and the Company expects to incur increased interest expense from the refinancing or extension of loans that may currently carry below-market interest rates. In certain cases, the Company has limited, and may continue to limit, its exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of its floating-rate debt by using interest rate cap and swap agreements. Such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow the Company to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve its desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. However, any interest rate cap or swap agreements that the Company enters into may not be effective in reducing its exposure to interest rate changes.

 Equity in Loss of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures: 
 Equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures increased 28.8 million from 2023 to 2024 .

 Gain (loss) on Sale or Write Down of Assets, net: 
 Gain (loss) on sale or write down of assets, net increased 407.5 million from 2023 to 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Investing Activities: 
 Cash used in investing activities was 17.4 million in 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 32.3 million in 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributed to decreases in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of 142.8 million and increases in development, redevelopment and renovation of 26.7 million offset in part by increases in proceeds from the sale of assets of 87.7 million, decreases in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of 18.6 million and decreases in property improvements of 6.4 million and acquisitions of property of 4.8 million. The decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the distribution of net loan proceeds from the Scottsdale Fashion Square refinance in 2023 (See Financing Activities in Management s Overview and Summary). 
 Financing Activities: 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased 79.9 million from 2023 to 2024. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a decrease in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of 196.4 million, an increase in proceeds from stock offerings under the ATM Program of 149.0 million and a decrease in deferred financing costs of 22.6 million offset in part by a decrease in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of 284.0 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses, debt service and dividend requirements for the next twelve months and beyond through cash generated from operations, distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its revolving loan facility. 
 Additionally, the Company is focused on implementing the Path Forward Plan, including its goal to reduce its Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to a lower level over the next three to four years. The Company may achieve this goal, and other goals set in connection with the Path Forward Plan, through a variety of methods and the timing, extent and impact of any transactions that the Company has or will undertake while implementing the Path Forward Plan are indeterminable at this time. In order to de-leverage its capital structure, the Company may pursue asset dispositions and acquisitions, experience organic growth in EBITDA as tenants in its lease pipeline open for business, be selective about undertaking new development and redevelopment projects, and/or issue common stock. Asset sales will focus on whether a property is core to the Company s strategy and may include defaulting on certain mortgage debts on the Company's properties and giving possession of such secured properties to the lender. 
 Uses of Capital 
 The following tables summarize capital expenditures incurred at the Centers (at the Company's pro rata share): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Consolidated Centers: Acquisitions of property, building improvement and equipment(1) 69,605 69,255 Development, redevelopment, expansions and renovations of Centers 66,924 56,575 Tenant allowances 12,655 22,530 Deferred leasing charges 3,308 4,836 152,492 153,196 Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers: Acquisitions of property, building improvement and equipment 9,814 8,765 Development, redevelopment, expansions and renovations of Centers 27,433 51,944 Tenant allowances 12,841 11,075 Deferred leasing charges 3,753 3,444 53,841 75,228 
 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this includes the cash paid of 36.4 million on May 14, 2024, for the Company s acquisition of its joint venture partner s 40 interest in Arrowhead Towne Center and South Plains Mall. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, this includes 46.7 million relating to the acquisition of five former Sears parcels in the MS Portfolio LLC joint venture (See Acquisitions in Management s Overview and Summary). 
 The Company expects amounts to be incurred during the next twelve months for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable to 2024. The Company expects to incur approximately 35.0 million to 45.0 million during the remainder of 2024 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these expenditures, developments

 and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of cash on hand, debt or equity financings, which are expected to include borrowings under the Company's revolving loan facility and sales of common stock, from property financings and construction loans, each to the extent available. The Company will be very selective in undertaking any future development or redevelopment projects and may choose to pause existing projects if the Company believes they are no longer economically viable. 
 Sources of Capital 
 The Company has also generated liquidity in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, through equity offerings and issuances, property refinancings, joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets. Asset sales will focus on whether a property is core to the Company's strategy and may include defaulting on certain mortgage debts on the Company's properties and giving possession of such secured properties to the lender. For example, the Company sold The Marketplace at Flagstaff in Flagstaff, Arizona on May 2, 2023, Superstition Springs Power Center in Mesa, Arizona on July 17, 2023, and the Company's joint venture sold One Westside in Los Angeles, California on December 27, 2023. Since implementing the Path Forward Plan, the Company's joint venture sold Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri on June 28, 2024 and the Company sold its 50 interest in Biltmore Fashion Park in Phoenix, Arizona on July 31, 2024. The Company used its share of proceeds from these transactions to pay down its revolving loan facility and other debt obligations. In addition, the Company is under contract to sell The Oaks, which is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company and certain joint venture partners sold various land parcels in separate transactions for aggregate proceeds of 16.4 million and 3.4 million, respectively (at the Company's share), which the Company used to pay down debt and for other general corporate purposes. Furthermore, the Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts and units that may be sold from time to time by the Company. 
 On March 26, 2021, the Company registered an "at the market" offering program, pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 500 million under the ATM Program, in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 9.4 million shares of common stock were issued under the ATM Program for gross proceeds of 151.7 million at a weighted average share price of 16.14. The ATM Program was fully utilized as of September 30, 2024 and is no longer active. 
 The following table sets forth certain information with respect to issuances under the ATM Program as of September 30, 2024. 
 (Dollars and shares in thousands) ATM Program For the Three Months Ended: Number of Shares Issued Net Proceeds Sales Commissions March 31, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 9,402 148,624 3,030 
 The capital and credit markets can fluctuate and, at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. The Company has been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions, including periods of economic slowdown or recession. 
 For example, the credit markets have experienced and may continue to experience a slowdown stemming from broader market issues pertaining to various factors, including among others, the health of regional banks, prevailing market sentiment regarding various commercial real estate sectors and interest rate increases imposed by the Federal Reserve. While interest rates have begun to decrease, they remain elevated and the Company expects to incur increased interest expense from the refinancing or extension of loans that may carry below-market interest rates. In addition, increases in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt will cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future. 
 The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness, which includes mortgages and other notes payable, at September 30, 2024 was 6.78 billion (consisting of 4.34 billion of consolidated debt, less 0.03 billion of noncontrolling interests, plus 2.47 billion of its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). The Company has no remaining maturities in 2024. The 
 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgage notes collateralized by individual properties. The Company expects that all of the maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company's revolving loan facility or cash on hand, with the exception of Santa Monica Place (See Financing Activities in Management s Overview and Summary). 
 The Company believes that the pro rata debt provides useful information to investors regarding its financial condition because it includes the Company s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for consolidated debt, excludes the Company s partners share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and presenting its pro rata share of debt in this manner can help investors better understand the Company s financial condition after taking into account the Company's economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company s pro rata share of debt should not be considered as a substitute for the Company s total consolidated debt determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was contingently liable for 41.1 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. As of September 30, 2024, 40.9 million of these letters of credit were secured by restricted cash. On October 30, 2024, 35.0 million of these letters of credit secured by restricted cash was canceled and is no longer restricted cash. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company. 
 The Company continues to actively address its near-term, non-recourse loan maturities, with eight completed transactions year-to-date in 2024 totaling approximately 1.3 billion, or approximately 1.1 billion at the Company s pro rata share. For additional information on the Company s financing transactions in the year ended 2023 through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, see Financing Activities in Management s Overview and Summary. 
 Previously, the Company had a 525.0 million revolving loan facility, which was scheduled to mature on April 14, 2024. On September 11, 2023, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which amended and restated their prior credit agreement, and provides for an aggregate 650.0 million revolving loan facility that matures on February 1, 2027, with a one-year extension option. The revolving loan facility can be expanded up to 950.0 million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions. Concurrently with the entry into the amended and restated credit agreement, the Company drew 152.0 million of the amount available under the revolving loan facility and used the proceeds to repay in full amounts outstanding under its prior credit facility. All obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed unconditionally by the Company and are secured in the form of mortgages on certain wholly-owned assets and pledges of equity interests held by certain of the Company s subsidiaries. The new credit facility bears interest, at the Operating Partnership s option, at either the base rate (as defined in the credit agreement) or adjusted term SOFR (as defined in the credit agreement) plus, in both cases, an applicable margin. The applicable margin depends on the Company s overall leverage ratio and ranges from 1.00 to 2.50 over the selected index rate. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing rate was SOFR plus a spread of 2.35 . As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility. Unamortized deferred finance costs were 12.6 million as of September 30, 2024, which are netted against balances outstanding or as an asset when no borrowings are outstanding on the credit facility which was the case as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s availability under the revolving loan facility for additional borrowings was 649.8 million. 
 Cash dividends and distributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 120.1 million (including distributions from consolidated joint ventures of 1.1 million), which were funded by operations.

 Funds From Operations ("FFO") 
 The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 Prior to June 13, 2024, the Company accounted for its joint venture in Chandler Freehold as a financing arrangement. In connection with this treatment, the Company recognized financing expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the financing arrangement obligation, (ii) any payments to the joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. The Company excludes from its definition of FFO the noted expenses related to the changes in fair value and for the payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. On November 16, 2023, the Company acquired its joint venture partner s 49.9 ownership interest in Freehold Raceway Mall and as a result, this property is no longer part of the financing arrangement and is 100 owned by the Company. On June 13, 2024, the partnership agreement between the Company and its partner was amended. As a result, the Company no longer accounts for its investment in Chandler Fashion Center as a financing arrangement. Effective June 13, 2024, the Company accounts for its investment in Chandler Fashion Center under the equity method of accounting (See Note 12 Financing Arrangement and Note 16 Dispositions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). References to Chandler Freehold for the period November 16, 2023 through June 13, 2024 shall be deemed to only refer to Chandler Fashion Center. 
 The Company also presents FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, accrued default interest expense and gain or loss on non-real estate investments. 
 FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. In addition, the Company believes that FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, impact associated with extinguishment of debt, accrued default interest expense and impact of non-cash changes in the market value of non-real estate investments provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company s performance as it shows a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company s operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company s results. On March 19, 2024, the Company closed on a three-year extension of the Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls non-recourse loan and all default interest expense was reversed. Effective April 9, 2024, default interest expense has been accrued on the non-recourse loan on Santa Monica Place. GAAP requires that the Company accrue default interest expense, which is not expected to be paid and is expected to be reversed once a loan is modified or once title to the mortgaged loan collateral is transferred. The Company believes that the accrual of default interest on non-recourse loans, and the related reversal thereof should be excluded. The Company holds certain non-real estate investments that are subject to mark to market changes every quarter. These investments are not core to the Company's business, and the changes to market value and the related gain or loss are entirely non-cash in nature. As a result, the Company believes that the gain or loss on non-real estate investments should be excluded. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company updated its presentation to exclude gain or loss on non-real estate investments for the reasons noted above. The Company recast the presentation for prior periods to reflect this change. 
 The Company believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts. 
 Management compensates for the limitations of FFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and a reconciliation of net (loss) income to FFO and FFO diluted. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be compared with the Company's reported net income (loss) and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The following reconciles net income (loss) attributable to the Company to FFO and FFO diluted attributable to common stockholders and unit holders-basic and diluted, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, accrued default interest expense and loss on non-real estate investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars and shares in thousands):

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. 
 The following table sets forth information as of September 30, 2024 concerning the Company's long-term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value (dollars in thousands): Expected Maturity Date For the twelve months ending September 30, 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total Fair Value CONSOLIDATED CENTERS: Long-term debt: Fixed rate(1) 633,535 562,882 409,347 734,219 228,606 1,532,938 4,101,527 3,897,043 Average interest rate 3.60 4.74 4.02 4.98 4.29 4.40 4.38 Floating rate 300,000 300,000 300,673 Average interest rate 6.62 6.62 Total debt Consolidated Centers 633,535 862,882 409,347 734,219 228,606 1,532,938 4,401,527 4,197,716 UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE CENTERS: Long-term debt (at Company's pro rata share): Fixed rate 118,822 352,868 391,289 735,746 498,357 343,202 2,440,284 2,387,206 Average interest rate 7.59 3.67 6.92 4.99 6.70 3.84 5.42 Floating rate 33,028 12,000 45,028 47,297 Average interest rate 9.36 7.62 8.90 Total debt Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers 118,822 352,868 424,317 735,746 510,357 343,202 2,485,312 2,434,503 
 (1) On October 28, 2024, the Company replaced the existing 600.0 million loan on Queens Center with a new 525.0 million, five-year fixed rate loan (See "Financing Activity" in Management Overview and Summary). 
 The Consolidated Centers' total fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 4.1 billion and 3.8 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on the fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 4.38 and 4.29 , respectively. The Consolidated Centers' total floating rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 300.0 million and 475.8 million, respectively. The average interest rate on the floating rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 6.62 and 7.43 , respectively. 
 The Company's pro rata share of the Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers' fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 2.4 billion and 2.8 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on the fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 5.42 and 5.06 , respectively. The Company's pro rata share of the Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers' floating rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 45.0 million and 45.2 million, respectively. The average interest rate on the floating rate debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 8.90 and 9.00 , respectively. 
 The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has interest rate cap agreements in place (See Note 4 Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Note 5 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The respective loans each require an interest rate cap agreement to be in place at all times, which limits how high the prevailing floating loan rate index (i.e., SOFR) for the loans can rise. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, SOFR for each of these loans exceeded the strike interest rate (the "Strike Rate") within the required interest rate cap agreement. If SOFR does exceed the 
 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 Strike Rate, each of these loans would then be considered fixed rate debt. If SOFR for these respective loans thereafter no longer exceeds the Strike Rate, then these loans would once again be considered floating rate debt. 
 In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 3.5 million per year based on 345.0 million of floating rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. In addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (See Note 10 Mortgage Notes Payable and Note 11 Bank and Other Notes Payable in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (a) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In addition, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 10.1 
 THE MACERICH COMPANY AMENDED AND RESTATED SEVERANCE PAY PLAN 
 The Macerich Company Change in Control Severance Pay Plan for Executive Vice Presidents and the Macerich Company Change in Control Severance Pay Plan for Senior Executives are each hereby amended and restated by the Company (as defined below), effective as of March 1, 2024 (the Effective Date into a single combined plan, and such plan, as amended and restated herein and renamed, the Plan ). The Plan is intended to be a top hat welfare benefit plan under ERISA for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. 
 SECTION 1. PURPOSE 
 The Board of Directors of the Company believes that it is in the best interests of the Company to encourage the continued dedication to the Company of certain of the Company s and its Subsidiaries employees in the face of potentially distracting circumstances arising from the possibility or occurrence of a termination of employment, whether or not in connection with a change in control of the Company, and the Board (defined below) has established the Plan for this purpose. The purpose of the Plan is to provide severance benefits in the event certain employees incur a Qualified Termination. 
 SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS 
 (a) Accrued Obligations means, with respect to an Eligible Employee, the sum of the Eligible Employee s (i) Base Salary through the Date of Termination to the extent earned and not theretofore paid, (ii) accrued vacation pay and or personal days to the extent earned and payable in connection with the termination of employment pursuant to the Company s policy, (iii) accrued annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year immediately preceding the year in which the Date of Termination occurs, to the extent such bonus is determined to otherwise have been earned based on the Company s achievement of applicable performance targets and employee service requirements, but not theretofore paid, and (iv) vested rights under any equity, compensation or benefit plan, policy, practice or program of or any other contract or agreement with the Company or the Employer including, without limitation, any acceleration of vesting of equity awards that shall occur upon a Qualifying Termination as set forth in the applicable equity award agreement and or equity incentive plan pursuant to which such awards have been granted Double Trigger Equity Vesting ). Accrued Obligations described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be paid in a lump sum in cash within the time required by law but in no event more than 30 days after the Date of Termination. Accrued Obligations described in clause (iii) shall be paid at such time as annual incentive bonuses for such fiscal year are otherwise paid pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan, but in no event later than 75 days after the end of such fiscal year. Accrued Obligations described in clause (iv) (including without limitation the Double Trigger Equity Vesting) shall be paid at such time(s) as required under the terms of the applicable plan or program. 
 (b) Base Salary means the annual base rate of compensation payable as salary to the Eligible Employee by the Employer as of the Eligible Employee s Date of Termination or as of immediately prior to the first day of the Change in Control Period, whichever is higher, before deductions of voluntary deferrals authorized by the Eligible Employee or required by law to be withheld

 SECTION 7. REDUCTION OF CERTAIN BENEFITS 
 (a) Reduction in Benefits . Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the receipt of all payments or distributions by the Company or the Employer in the nature of compensation to or for the Eligible Employee s benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise (a Payment ), would subject the Eligible Employee to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the accounting firm which audited the Company prior to the corporate transaction which results in the application of such excise tax, or another nationally known accounting or employee benefits consulting firm selected by the Company prior to such corporate transaction, in consultation with the Tier 1 Executive (the Accounting Firm ), shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments to the Reduced Amount (as defined below).

 (c) Underpayment or Overpayment . As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Eligible Employee pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so paid or distributed (the Overpayment or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Eligible Employee pursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed (the Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or a Subsidiary or the Eligible Employee which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, the Eligible Employee shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code provided , however , that no amount shall be payable by the Eligible Employee to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Eligible Employee is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Eligible Employee together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 
 (d) Reduced Amount and After-Tax Receipt . For purposes hereof, the following terms have the meanings set forth below (i) Reduced Amount shall mean the greatest amount of Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code if the Accounting Firm determines to reduce Payments pursuant to this Section 12 and (ii) Net After-Tax Receipt shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on the Eligible Employee with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to the Eligible Employee s taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as the Eligible Employee certifies, in the Eligible Employee s sole discretion, as likely to apply to her him in the relevant tax year(s). 
 SECTION 8. WITHHOLDING 
 Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, all payments required to be made by the Employer hereunder to an Eligible Employee or her his estate or beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts relating to taxes as the Employer reasonably may determine it should withhold pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. In lieu of withholding such amounts, in whole or in part, the Employer may, in its sole discretion, accept other provisions for the payment of taxes and any withholdings as required by law, provided that the Employer is satisfied that all requirements of law affecting its responsibilities to withhold compensation have been satisfied.

 (iv) Content of Notification on Review . The Board shall provide a claimant with written or electronic Notification of a Plan's benefit determination following an appeal described in Section 12(b)(i). Any electronic Notification shall comply with the standards imposed by 29 CFR 
 -13-

 (A) The specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination 
 (B) Reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the benefit determination is based 
 (C) A statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claimant's claim for benefits and 
 (D) A statement of the claimant s right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. 
 (c) Calculating Time Periods . The period of time within which a benefit determination (including a benefit determination on review) is required to be made shall begin at the time a claim (or appeal) is filed in accordance with the reasonable procedures of the Plan, without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a benefit determination accompanies the filing. In the event that a period of time is extended due to a claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for making the benefit determination shall be tolled from the date on which the Notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information. 
 (d) Extension of Notice Period . The ninety (90) day and sixty (60) day periods applicable to notice furnished by the Plan Administrator in Sections 12(a) and 12(b) above may be extended at the discretion of the Plan Administrator for a second ninety (90) or sixty (60) day period, as the case may be, provided that written notice of the extension is furnished to the claimant prior to the termination of the initial period, indicating the special circumstances requiring such extension of time and the date by which a final decision is expected. 
 (e) Assignment . Plan benefits shall be reduced to the extent an Eligible Employee owes money to the Company with the exception of any Company provided housing assistance loan to an Eligible Employee which loan will be payable in accordance with the terms of the loan. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no benefit payable under the Plan shall be subject in any way to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, garnishment, execution, or encumbrance of any kind, and any attempt to accomplish the same shall be void. No Eligible Employee entitled to benefits under the Plan shall have power to transfer, assign, mortgage or otherwise encumber any interest he may have herein, or to anticipate in any manner by assignment, agreement (including, but not limited to, any agreement to pay alimony, separate maintenance or child support, whether or not said agreement is pursuant to, or embodied in, a court order), or otherwise, the payment of any benefit or any other sum to be provided for the Eligible Employee hereunder nor shall the interest of any Eligible Employee under this Plan or in any benefit provided hereunder be subject to attachment, garnishment, seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, decrees or obligations of any kind owed by such person (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay alimony, separate maintenance or child support for which said person shall be obligated by virtue of a court order or decree of any court 
 -14- 

of any jurisdiction or by virtue of any agreement whether or not embodied in such a court order or decree), or be transferable by operation of law in event of bankruptcy, insolvency or otherwise. 
 (f) Facility of Payment . Whenever and as often as any person entitled to payments hereunder shall be determined to be a minor or under other legal disability or otherwise incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage the person s financial affairs, the Sponsoring Employer, in its discretion, may direct that all or any portion of the benefit payments be made (a) to such person (b) to such person s legal guardian or conservator or (c) to such person s spouse or to any other person. The decision of the Sponsoring Employer shall, in each case, be final and binding upon all persons. Any payment made pursuant to the authority herein conferred shall operate as a complete discharge of the obligations of the Sponsoring Employer under the Plan in respect thereof. 
 (g) Responsibility for Payment . The Sponsoring Employer shall be liable for the payment of benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The benefits under the Plan shall be payable solely by the Sponsoring Employer and each Eligible Employee who shall claim the right to any payment under the Plan shall be entitled to look only to the Sponsoring Employer for such payment. 
 (h) Limitation on Benefits . The Sponsoring Employer shall have no obligation to set aside, earmark, or entrust any fund, policy, or money with which to pay its obligations under this Plan. The Eligible Employee, or any successor in interest, shall be and remain simply a general, unsecured creditor of the Sponsoring Employer with respect to the benefits under this Plan in the same manner as any other creditor who has a general claim for an unpaid liability. 
 SECTION 13. GOVERNING LAW 
 The validity of this Plan or of any of its provisions shall be determined under, and it shall be construed and administered according to, the laws of the State of California (without regard to its choice of law principles), except to the extent preempted by ERISA, or any other applicable laws of the United States of America provided that if any provision is susceptible to more than one interpretation, such interpretation shall be given thereto as is consistent with the Plan being an unfunded top hat employee welfare benefit plan maintained by an employer within the meaning of ERISA. 
 SECTION 14. SEVERABILITY 
 If any part of any provision of this Plan shall be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such part shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability only, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Plan. 
 SECTION 15. DISCLAIMER OF RIGHTS 
 No provision in this Plan shall be construed to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of the Employer, or to interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Employer either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any individual at any time, to terminate any employment or other relationship between any individual and the Employer or to require the Employer to pay severance for any termination of employment prior to a Change in Control. The obligation of the Employer to pay any benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be 
 -15- 

interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described herein, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed herein. The Plan shall in no way be interpreted to require the Employer to transfer any amounts to a third party trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any participant or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan. 
 SECTION 16. CAPTIONS 
 The use of captions in this Plan is for the convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision of this Plan. 
 SECTION 17. NUMBER AND GENDER 
 With respect to words used in this Plan, the singular form shall include the plural form, the masculine gender shall include the feminine gender, etc., as the context requires. 
 SECTION 18. INDEMNIFICATION 
 To the extent permitted by law, the Sponsoring Employer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Plan Administrator (if not the Sponsoring Employer) and the Board from and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by any such person as a result of any act, or omission to act, in connection with the performance of such person s duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Plan and under ERISA, other than such liabilities, costs and expenses as may result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such person. The foregoing right of indemnification shall be in addition to any other right to which any such person may be entitled as a matter of law or otherwise. The Sponsoring Employer may obtain, pay for and keep current a policy or policies of insurance, insuring the Plan Administrator and the Board from and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by any such person as a result of any act, or omission to act, in connection with the performance of his duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Plan. 
 SECTION 19. SECTION 409A 
 (a) Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Eligible Employee s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Company determines that the Eligible Employee is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Eligible Employee becomes entitled to under this Plan on account of the Eligible Employee s separation from service would be considered nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A(a) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (A) six months and one day after the Eligible Employee s separation from service, or (B) the Eligible Employee s death. Each payment under this Plan constitutes a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. 
 (b) The parties intend that this Plan will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of this Plan is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code. The parties agree that this Plan may be 
 -16- 

amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. 
 (c) All in-kind benefits provided and expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Plan shall be provided by the Employer or incurred by the Eligible Employee during the time periods set forth in this Plan. All reimbursements shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event shall any reimbursement be paid after the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of in-kind benefits provided or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided or the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year. Such right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
 (d) To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Plan constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Eligible Employee s termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Eligible Employee s separation from service. All references to an Eligible Employee s termination of employment under this Plan shall only occur if the same also constitutes a separation from service as defined under Section 409A of the Code. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). 
 (e) The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Eligible Employee or any other person if any provisions of this Plan are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.
