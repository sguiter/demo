 million in damages, consisting of approximately million in lost profits and approximately million in royalties. Post-trial motions, including the Company s motions for a permanent injunction, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest, are pending. NanoString filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware on February 4, 2024, and the Court s consideration of these post-trial motions was stayed due to the bankruptcy filing. In May 2024, Bruker Corporation Bruker acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of NanoString, including the litigation between the Company and NanoString, and the NanoString product lines at issue. Bruker, Bruker Spatial Biology, Inc. and Bruker Nano, Inc. were substituted as defendants in the GeoMx Action. Post-trial briefing is complete following supplementation by the parties. Due to the uncertainties in collecting the jury award, the Company has not recorded a receivable from NanoString as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 On February 28, 2022, the Company filed a second suit against NanoString in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NanoString s CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and associated instruments, reagents and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 10,227,639 and 11,021,737 (the CosMx Action ). On May 12, 2022, the Company filed an amended complaint in the CosMx Action additionally alleging that the CosMx products additionally infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 11,293,051, 11,293,052 and 11,293,054. NanoString filed its answer to the CosMx Action on May 26, 2022. On March 1, 2023, the Company filed a second amended complaint additionally alleging that the CosMx products infringe U.S. Patent No. 11,542,554. The Company is seeking, among other relief, injunctive relief and unspecified damages (including attorneys fees) in relation to NanoString s making, using, selling, offering to sell, exporting and/or importing in the United States the CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and associated instruments, reagents and services. NanoString filed its answer to the second amended complaint on March 22, 2023. Discovery is in progress. A Markman hearing was held on January 10, 2024, and the Court issued its claim construction order on February 1, 2024. 
 On August 16, 2022, NanoString filed a counterclaim in the CosMx Action alleging that the Company s Visium products infringe U.S. Patent No. 11,377,689 (the 689 patent ). The Company filed its answer to NanoString s counterclaim in the CosMx Action on August 30, 2022. On November 23, 2022, the Company moved to sever claims relating to NanoString s assertion of the 689 patent and consolidate those claims with the patent case NanoString filed against the Company on October 20, 2022 (discussed below). On January 24, 2023, the Court granted the Company s motion. 
 On May 1, 2023, NanoString filed a motion in the CosMx Action to add antitrust, unfair competition, tort and contract counterclaims. NanoString seeks, among other relief, injunction relief (including that the Company grant NanoString a license to the patents that the Company asserted against NanoString in the CosMx Action) and unspecified damages (including attorneys fees). On July 10, 2023, the Court denied NanoString s motion for leave to add a contract counterclaim but otherwise granted the motion for leave to amend. On May 24, 2023, NanoString filed a motion to bifurcate its amended counterclaims and a motion for expedited discovery. On June 6, 2023, the Court denied NanoString s motion to bifurcate and granted its motion for expedited discovery. Bruker, Bruker Spatial Biology, Inc. and Bruker Nano, Inc. were substituted as defendants in the CosMx Action. Trial is scheduled for May 2025. The Company believes Bruker s claims are meritless and intends to vigorously defend itself.

 million Euro security deposit. 
 On July 29, 2022, NanoString filed a nullity action with the German Federal Patent Court challenging the validity of the EP928 patent. On February 10, 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion upholding the validity of certain claims of the EP928 patent directed to in situ analysis. On May 7, 2024, the German Federal Patent Court reversed its preliminary opinion and revoked the German part of the EP928 patent. The Company strongly disagrees with this decision and plans to appeal the decision. 
 On June 1, 2023, the Company filed requests for preliminary injunctions in the Munich Local Division of the Unified Patent Court UPC alleging that NanoString s CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and associated instruments, reagents and services for RNA detection infringe the EP928 patent and EP Patent No. 4108782 (the EP782 patent ). Hearings were held for the EP782 and EP928 patents on September 5 and September 19, respectively. On September 19, 2023, the UPC granted the Company s request with respect to the EP782 patent and issued a preliminary injunction requiring NanoString to stop selling and supplying CosMx instruments and reagents for RNA detection in all 17 UPC member states. On October 10, 2023, the UPC denied the Company s preliminary injunction request for the EP928 patent. On October 2, 2023, NanoString filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction for the EP782 patent in the UPC Court of Appeals. A hearing was held before the UPC Court of Appeals on December 18, 2023. The UPC Court of Appeals overturned the preliminary injunction on February 26, 2024. 
 On August 31 and September 18, 2023 the Company filed main requests in the Munich Local Division of the UPC alleging that NanoString's CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and associated instruments, reagents and services for RNA detection infringe the EP782 and EP928 patents, respectively. No hearings have yet been set for these main requests. 
 On July 18, 2023, NanoString filed an opposition in the European Patent Office challenging the validity of the EP782 patent. An oral hearing for this opposition is scheduled on March 18, 2025. On July 27, 2023, NanoString filed a revocation action in the Munich Central Division of the UPC challenging the validity of the EP928 patent. An oral hearing for this revocation

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024 (our "Annual Report"). As discussed in the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, the following discussion and analysis, in addition to historical financial information, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the section titled Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a life sciences technology company focused on building innovative products and solutions to interrogate, understand and master biology. Our integrated solutions include instruments, consumables and software for analyzing biological systems at resolution and scale that matches the complexity of biology. We have launched multiple products that enable researchers to understand and interrogate biological analytes in their full biological context. Our commercial product portfolio leverages our Chromium X Series and Chromium Connect instruments, which we refer to as Chromium instruments, our Visium CytAssist, an instrument designed to simplify the Visium solution workflow by facilitating the transfer of transcriptomic probes from standard glass slides to Visium slides, and our Xenium Analyzer, an instrument designed for fully automated high-throughput analysis of cells in their tissue environment, which we refer to as Spatial instruments, and our proprietary microfluidic chips, slides, reagents and other consumables for our Chromium, Visium and Xenium solutions, which we refer to as consumables. We bundle our software with these products to guide customers through the workflow, from sample preparation through analysis and visualization. 
 Our products cover a wide variety of applications and allow researchers to analyze biological systems at fundamental resolutions and on massive scale, such as at the single cell level for millions of cells. Customers purchase instruments and consumables from us for use in their experiments. In addition to instrument and consumable sales, we derive revenue from post-warranty service contracts for our instruments. 
 Since our inception in 2012, we have incurred net losses in each year. Our net losses were 35.8 million and 133.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 93.0 million and 206.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1.4 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaling 398.2 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future and to incur operating losses in the near term. We expect our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 
 attract, hire and retain qualified personnel; 
 scale our technology platforms and introduce new products and services; 
 protect and defend our intellectual property; 
 acquire businesses or technologies; and 
 invest in processes, tools and infrastructure to support the growth of our business.

Table of Contents 

 primarily due to interest income generated from our cash equivalents and marketable securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting an increase in interest rates. 
 Other expense, net decreased by 3.3 million, or 267 to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other expense, net decreased by 5.3 million, or 123 to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases were driven by realized and unrealized losses from foreign currency rate measurement fluctuations. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Company s provision for income taxes was 1.3 million and 4.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 1.2 million and 4.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Deferred tax assets related to our domestic operations are fully offset by a valuation allowance. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 398.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have generated negative cumulative cash flows from operations since inception through September 30, 2024, and we have generated losses from operations since inception as reflected in our accumulated deficit of 1.4 billion. 
 We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between approximately 15 million and 20 million during the next 12 months, which we expect to include, among other expenditures, equipment to be used for manufacturing and research and development. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, research and development efforts, investments in or acquisitions of complementary or enhancing technologies or businesses, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new facilities, the expansion of sales and marketing and international activities, legal costs associated with defending and enforcing intellectual property rights and the introduction of new products. 
 We take a long-term view in growing and scaling our business and we regularly review acquisition and investment opportunities, and we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, real estate, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights, and any such acquisitions or investments could significantly increase our capital needs. We regularly review opportunities that meet our long-term growth objectives. 
 We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position. 
 We intend to continue to evaluate market conditions and may in the future pursue additional sources of funding, such as mortgage or other financing, to further enhance our financial position and to execute our business strategy. In addition, should prevailing economic, financial, business or other factors adversely affect our ability to meet our operating cash requirements, we could be required to obtain funding though traditional or alternative sources of financing. We cannot be certain that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. 
 
 Sources of liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through sales of convertible preferred stock and common stock, revenue from sales of our products and the incurrence of indebtedness.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for interim financial information and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk contained in Part II of our Annual Report. Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are regularly subject to lawsuits, claims, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions and other legal and regulatory proceedings involving intellectual property disputes, commercial disputes, competition and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of lawsuits, claims, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings in the future and as our business grows, including proceedings related to product liability or our acquisitions, securities issuances or our business practices, including public disclosures about our business. Our success depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. In the past, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. We have been involved in multiple patent litigation matters and other proceedings in the past and we expect that given the litigious history of our industry and the high profile of operating as a public company, third parties may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We have also initiated litigation to defend our technology including technology developed through our significant investments in research and development. It is our general policy not to out-license our patents but to protect our sole right to own and practice them. There are inherent uncertainties in these legal matters, some of which are beyond management s control, making the ultimate outcomes difficult to predict. 
 Refer to Note 4 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to our risk factors that we believe are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report, and any documents incorporated by reference therein, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 None of our directors or officers , modified or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as follows:

If Participant does not choose to participate in the Plan, his or her employment status or service with the Company Group will not be adversely affected.

 c. Participant understands that Data will be transferred to one or more service provider(s) selected by the Company, which may assist the Company with the implementation, administration, and management of the Plan. Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different, including less stringent, data privacy laws and protections than his or her country. Participant understands that if he or she resides outside the United States, he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative. Participant authorizes the Company and any other possible recipients that may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering, and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or another form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing his or her participation in the Plan. 
 d. Participant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage his or her participation in the Plan, including to maintain records regarding participation.

Further, Participant understands that he or she is providing these consents on a purely voluntary basis. If Participant does not consent or if he or she later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her engagement as a service provider with the Company Group will not be adversely affected the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing his or her consent is that the Company will not be able to grant him or her Restricted Stock Units under the Plan or administer or maintain Restricted Stock Units. Therefore, Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect his or her ability to participate in the Plan (including the right to retain the Restricted Stock Units). Participant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representative for more information on the consequences of his or her refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent.

The Data is collected from Participant, and from the Company Group, for the purpose of implementing, administering, and managing the Plan pursuant to its terms. The legal basis (that is, the legal justification) for processing the Data is that it is necessary to perform, administer and manage the Plan pursuant to this Agreement between Participant and the Company, and in Company s legitimate interests to comply with applicable non-EU laws when performing, administering and managing the Plan, subject to his or her interest and fundamental rights.

Participant understands that the Data will be transferred to and among the Company Group, as well as service providers (such as stock administration providers, brokers, transfer agents, accounting firms, payroll processing firms or tax firms), for the purposes explained above, which are necessary to allow the Company to perform this Agreement. Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States and in other jurisdictions outside of the European Economic Area where the Company Group or its service providers have operations. The United States and some of these other jurisdictions have not been found by the European Commission to have adequate data protection safeguards. If the Company Group makes transfers of Data outside of the European Economic Area, those transfers will be made solely to the extent necessary to perform this Agreement and take necessary actions in connection with such performance. In addition, service providers may commit to providing adequate safeguards for the transferred Data, such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent that my accumulated payroll deductions would result in my ability to purchase more than 2,000 shares of Class A Common Stock during any Offering Period (the Offering Period Maximum ), I understand and agree that I will only be permitted to purchase a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the Offering Period Maximum, and that any excess payroll deductions remaining after such purchase will be returned to me as soon as practicable following the expiration of such Offering Period.

Notwithstanding the

 Regardless of any action the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the participation in the Plan and legally applicable to me Tax-Related Items ), I acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains my responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary. I further acknowledge that the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary (1) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Purchase Right (as defined below) to purchase a number of shares of Class A Common Stock determined by dividing such Eligible Employee s Contributions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Eligible Employee s account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price (the Purchase Right ), including, but not limited to, the grant or exercise of the Purchase Right, purchase of shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the Purchase Right, the subsequent sale of shares of Class A Common Stock acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends and or any dividend equivalents and (2) does not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the Purchase Right or any aspect of the Purchase Right to reduce or eliminate the my liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.

 Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, I will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, I authorize the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following 
 
 (i) withholding from my wages or other cash compensation paid to me by the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary 
 
 (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Purchase Right either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on my behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent) or 
 
 (iii) withholding in shares of Class A Common Stock to be purchased upon exercise of the Purchase Right. 
 
 Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case I will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the shares of Class A Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Class A Common Stock, for tax purposes, I am deemed to have purchased the full number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject to the Purchase Right, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Class A Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the participation in the Plan. Finally, I must pay to the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary may be required to withhold or account for as a result of my 
 2 

participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to sell or deliver the shares of Class A Common Stock or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock, if I fail to comply with my obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

The Company reserves the right to modify the Plan and to impose other requirements on my participation in the Plan, on the option and on any shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. I agree to be bound by such modifications regardless of whether notice is given to me of such event, subject, in any case, to my right to withdraw from participation in the Plan. I further agree to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. 
 
 6.

I hereby agree to notify the Company in writing within thirty (30) days after the date of any disposition of my shares of Class A Common Stock and I will make adequate provision for U.S. federal, state or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon the disposition of the shares of Class A Common Stock . The Company may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from my compensation the amount necessary to meet any applicable withholding obligation including any withholding necessary to make available to the Company any tax deductions or benefits attributable to the sale or early disposition of shares of Class A Common Stock by me. If I dispose of such shares of Class A Common Stock at any time after the expiration of the two (2)-year and one (1)-year holding periods described above, I understand that I will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having received income only at the time of such disposition, and that such income will be taxed as ordinary income only to the extent of an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the amount by which the Fair Market Value of the shares of Class A Common Stock on the date of the disposition exceeds the Purchase Price paid for the shares of Class A Common Stock (generally 85 of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Class A Common Stock on the Enrollment Date or on the Exercise Date, whichever is lower), or (b) 15 of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Class A Common Stock on the Enrollment Date.
