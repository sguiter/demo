Balance at September 29, 2024 

Based on the quoted closing price of Technoprobe stock as of September 29, 2024, the fair value of the publicly traded investment was million, and there was other-than-temporary impairment identified. Teradyne's equity method basis difference was calculated as the difference between the investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets acquired. The equity method basis difference calculated at acquisition attributable to developed technology, customer relationships, trade name, property, plant and equipment, inventory, and deferred tax liability was million. The basis differences, net of tax, will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Teradyne made an accounting policy election to report its share of Technoprobe's results on a 3-month lag, which is applied consistently from period to period. Teradyne records its share of Technoprobe's net income or loss and the amortization of equity method basis difference, as 'Equity in net earnings of affiliate' in the consolidated statements of operations. Teradyne includes its share of Technoprobe's other comprehensive income and a cumulative translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income .

Contractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale securities held at September 29, 2024, exclude debt mutual funds with a fair market value of million as they do not have a contractual maturity date. Derivatives Teradyne conducts business in various foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies. As a result, Teradyne is exposed to risks relating to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Teradyne s foreign currency risk management objective is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and changes in its cash inflows attributable to the forecasted cash flows from certain foreign currency denominated revenues. To minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, Teradyne enters into foreign currency forward contracts. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded directly in earnings and is used to offset the change in value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Teradyne also enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the risk of changes in its cash inflows attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The cash flow hedges have maturities of less than six months and mature in the period of revenue recognition for certain products and services in backlog and forecasted to be recognized in a future period. Teradyne evaluates cash flow hedges for effectiveness at inception based on the critical terms match method. The hedges are not expected to incur any ineffectiveness however a quarterly qualitative assessment of effectiveness is done to determine if the critical terms match method remains appropriate to use. The change in fair value of the contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings at maturity date. Teradyne does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

million, of which million is for less than one year. Legal Claims Teradyne is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters. Teradyne believes that it has meritorious defenses against all pending claims and intends to vigorously contest them. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of any pending claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise, Teradyne believes the potential losses associated with all of these actions are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations Teradyne provides indemnification, to the extent permitted by law, to its officers, directors, employees and agents for liabilities arising from certain events or occurrences, while the officer, director, employee, or agent, is or was serving, at Teradyne s request in such capacity. Teradyne may enter into indemnification agreements with certain of its officers and directors. With respect to acquisitions, Teradyne provides indemnifications to or assumes indemnification obligations for the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired companies in accordance with the acquired companies by-laws and charter. As a matter of practice, Teradyne has maintained directors and officers liability insurance coverage including coverage for directors and officers of acquired companies. Teradyne enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business with customers, resellers, distributors, integrators, and suppliers. Most of these agreements require Teradyne to defend and/or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third party with respect to Teradyne s products. From time to time, Teradyne also indemnifies customers and business partners for damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, breach of confidentiality obligations and environmental claims relating to the use of Teradyne s products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of Teradyne, its employees, authorized agents or subcontractors. On occasion, Teradyne has also provided guarantees to customers regarding the delivery and performance of its products in addition to the warranty described below. As a matter of ordinary course of business, Teradyne warrants that its products will substantially perform in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery. Most warranties have a one-year duration commencing from installation. A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenues for estimated warranty expense based upon historical experience. When Teradyne receives revenue for extended warranties beyond the standard duration, the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. As of September 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023, Teradyne had a product warranty accrual of million and million, respectively, included in other 

25 

million and million, respectively, included in short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Teradyne provides minimum purchase guarantees to certain vendors to ensure continuity of supply against the market demand. Although some of these guarantees provide penalties for cancellations and/or modifications to the purchase commitments as the market demand decreases, most of the guarantees do not. Therefore, as the market demand decreases, Teradyne re-evaluates these guarantees and determines what charges, if any, should be recorded. With respect to its agreements covering product, business or entity divestitures and acquisitions, Teradyne provides certain representations, warranties and covenants to purchasers and agrees to indemnify and hold such purchasers harmless against breaches of such representations, warranties, and covenants. Many of the indemnification claims have a definite expiration date while some remain in force indefinitely. With respect to its acquisitions, Teradyne may, from time to time, assume the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. As a matter of ordinary course of business, Teradyne occasionally guarantees certain indebtedness obligations of its subsidiary companies, limited to the borrowings from financial institutions, purchase commitments to certain vendors and lease commitments to landlords. Based on historical experience and information known as of September 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , except for product warranty, Teradyne has not recorded any liabilities for these guarantees and obligations because the amount would be immaterial.

Effective tax rate 

On a quarterly basis, Teradyne evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assesses the need for a valuation allowance. As of September 29, 2024, Teradyne believes that it will ultimately realize the deferred tax assets recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. However, should Teradyne believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized, the tax provision would increase in the period in which Teradyne determined that the realizability was not likely. Teradyne considers the probability of future taxable income and historical profitability, among other factors, in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. As of September 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023, Teradyne had million and million, respectively, of reserves for uncertain tax positions. The million net decrease in reserves for uncertain tax positions is related to the audit settlements. As of September 29, 2024, Teradyne estimates that it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately million in the next twelve months because of a lapse of statutes of limitation. The estimated decrease relates to transfer pricing and U.S. federal and state research and development credits. Teradyne recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of September 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, of interest and penalties were accrued for uncertain tax positions. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, a benefit of million and expense of million, respectively, were recorded for interest and penalties related to income tax items.

million, or per diluted share. The tax savings due to the tax holiday for the nine months ended October 1, 2023, were million, or per diluted share. In November 2020, Teradyne entered into an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board which extended Teradyne's Singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. The new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. In the nine months ended September 29, 2024 , Teradyne recognized a million gain on the sale of the Device Interface Solutions business which resulted in million of income tax expense that was recognized as a discrete expense during the period in which the gain occurred. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was signed into law. The IRA introduced a alternative minimum tax based on the financial statement income of certain large corporations CAMT ), effective January 1, 2023. Teradyne currently does not expect the CAMT to have a material impact on its financial results. On December 15, 2022, the European Union ("EU") Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of , as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Pillar Two Framework. The EU s Pillar Two Directive effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. On July 17, 2023, the OECD published Administrative Guidance proposing certain safe harbor rules that effectively extend certain effective dates to January 1, 2027. Certain EU Member States where Teradyne has a legal presence have recently enacted the directive and administrative guidance into their local tax legislation. Additionally, countries outside the EU where Teradyne has a legal presence have enacted similar language as the EU Members States in their local tax legislation. Teradyne is closely monitoring these developments and evaluating the potential financial impact on income tax expense. As of September 29, 2024 , the effective tax rate was impacted by legislative changes that went into effect for Pillar Two in some of Teradyne's foreign jurisdictions, but it did not have a material impact on its financial statements. 
 reportable segments (Semiconductor Test, System Test, Wireless Test and Robotics). Each of the reportable segments represents an individual operating segment. The Semiconductor Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of semiconductor test products and services. The System Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of products and services for storage and system level test, defense/aerospace instrumentation test, and circuit-board test. The Wireless Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of wireless test products and services. The Robotics segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots, and advanced robotic control software.

Teradyne evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment income (loss) before income taxes. The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note B: Accounting Policies in Teradyne s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our robotics products include collaborative robotic arms and autonomous mobile robots AMRs used by global manufacturing, logistics and industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency, and decrease manufacturing and logistics costs. Our automatic test equipment and robotics products and services include: semiconductor test Semiconductor Test systems; 

 storage and system level test Integrated System Test , formally "Storage Test") systems, defense/aerospace Defense/Aerospace test instrumentation and systems, and circuit-board test and inspection Production Board Test systems (collectively these products represent System Test 

 wireless test Wireless Test systems; and 

 robotics Robotics products. 

 The market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. A few customers drive significant demand for our test products both through direct sales and sales to the customers supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. In the third quarter of 2024, we saw strength in Semiconductor Test performance driven in System-on-a-chip by compute and in memory by DRAM and high bandwidth memory. We expect compute and memory to continue to drive meaningful demand in the fourth quarter of 2024, helping to offset weakness in the mobility test market. We anticipate an eventual upturn in mobility at some point in 2025. Our Robotics segment consists of Universal Robots A/S UR ), a leading supplier of collaborative robotic arms, and Mobile Industrial Robots A/S MiR ), a leading maker of AMRs for industrial automation. The market for our Robotics segment products is dependent on the adoption of new automation technologies by large manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises SMEs throughout the world. Robotics results in the third quarter of 2024 were in line with our revenue forecast, putting us in position for full year growth due to new product offerings and expansion of our Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM and large account channels, along with increasing recurring revenue through new service and software offerings. On November 7, 2023, we and Technoprobe S.p.A, Technoprobe ), a leader in the design and production of probe cards, announced the establishment of a strategic partnership that will seek to accelerate growth for both companies and enable higher performance semiconductor test interfaces for customers worldwide. As part of the partnership, on May 27, 2024, we made an investment of 524.1 million in exchange for 10 of the issued and outstanding shares of Technoprobe, and we sold our Device Interface Solutions ("DIS") business to Technoprobe in exchange for 85.0 million, net of cash and cash equivalents sold, and a customary working capital adjustment. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. While revenues in our test businesses are predominantly in U.S. dollars, the majority of our Robotics revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar would negatively affect Robotics revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

 30 

Our corporate strategy continues to focus on profitably gaining market share in our test businesses through the introduction of differentiated products that target expanding segments and accelerating growth through continued investment in our Robotics businesses. We have strategically increased engineering and go-to-market spending, primarily in Semiconductor Test and Integrated System Test, in order to support market share gains. We plan to execute on our strategy while balancing capital allocations between returning capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends and using capital for opportunistic accretive acquisitions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have identified the policies which are critical to understanding our business and our results of operations. There have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, to the items disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, except as noted below. Equity method investments We account for investments using the equity method of accounting when we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies, but not control, of the investee. The equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and included in Equity method investment in the consolidated balance sheet. We record our share of investee's net income or loss and the amortization of equity method basis difference, calculated as the difference between the investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets acquired, on a 3-month lag, which is applied consistently from period to period. These results are reported in Equity in net earnings of affiliate in the consolidated statement of operations. We record our share of investee's other comprehensive income and a cumulative translation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, also on a 3-month lag. We monitor on an ongoing basis our equity method investments for indicators of other-than-temporary declines in fair value below carrying value. Critical accounting estimates are complex and may require significant judgment by management. Changes to the underlying assumptions may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates may change, as new events occur, and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Preparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 The change in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test, System Test, and Wireless Test were driven primarily by fluctuations in revenue within each of the businesses. In Robotics, the change in income before income taxes was driven primarily by increases to operating expenses. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, was 7.8 and 11.2 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the three months ended October 1, 2023, to the three months ended September 29, 2024, primarily resulted from the benefit of a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income and an increase in benefit related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in benefits related to tax credits and the international provision of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, was 12.0 and 14.0 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the nine months ended October 1, 2023, to the nine months ended September 29, 2024, primarily resulted from the benefit of a projected shift in the geographic distribution of income and an increase in benefit related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. These benefits were partially offset by decreases in benefits related to tax credits and the international provision of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Contractual Obligations There have been no changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances decreased by 259.5 million in the nine months ended September 29, 2024, to 677.6 million. Operating activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, provided cash of 389.6 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of 75.8 million due to a 7.3 million decrease in operating assets and a 83.1 million decrease in operating liabilities. The decrease in operating assets was primarily due to decreases in other assets and inventory of 61.4 million and 11.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a 65.3 million increase in accounts receivable, driven by higher sales in the third quarter. The decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 32.3 million decrease in accrued employee compensation, 25.9 million decrease in accounts payable, 18.9 million decrease in income taxes, 4.2 million decrease in retirement plans, and 5.5 million decrease in accrued other, partially offset by a 3.6 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advances. Investing activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, used cash of 554.9 million due to 527.1 million used for the purchases of investment, 140.7 million used for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, 35.1 million used for the purchase of marketable securities, partially offset by 90.3 million in proceeds from the sale of a business, 23.6 million and 33.2 million in proceeds from the sales and maturities and marketable securities, respectively, and 0.9 million in proceeds from life insurance. Financing activities during the nine months ended September 29, 2024, used cash of 88.6 million due to 185.0 million used for proceeds from borrowings on revolving credit facility of which 185.0 million in payments were paid back in full during the quarter, 56.9 million used for dividend payment, 55.1 million used for the repurchase of 0.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of 111.32 per share and 13.8 million used for payment related to net settlements of employee stock compensation awards, partially offset by 37.3 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans. Operating activities during the nine months ended October 1, 2023, provided cash of 336.5 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of 119.3 million due to a 27.4 million increase in operating assets and 91.9 million decrease in operating liabilities. The increase in operating assets was primarily due to a 64.0 million increase in prepayments and other assets due to prepayments to our contract manufacturers, partially offset by a 30.2 million decrease in accounts receivable and a 6.4 million decrease in inventories. The decrease in operating liabilities was due to a 56.6 million decrease in accrued employee compensation, a 49.5 million decrease in deferred revenue and customer advance payments, a 42.7 million decrease in income taxes, and 3.7 million of retirement plan contributions, partially offset by 36.0 million increase in accounts payable and an 24.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities. Investing activities during the nine months ended October 1, 2023, used cash of 149.2 million due to 137.8 million used for purchases of marketable securities and 115.3 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, and 5.0 million used for issuance of convertible loan, partially offset by 37.0 million and 71.4 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, respectively, and 0.5 million in proceeds from the cancellation of Teradyne owned life insurance policies related to the cash surrender value.

Financing activities during the nine months ended October 1, 2023, used cash of 410.8 million due to 346.5 million used for the repurchase of 3.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of 103.89 per share, 51.1 million used for dividend payments, and 26.7 million used for payments of convertible debt principal, and 20.6 million used for payment related to net settlements of employee stock compensation awards, partially offset by 34.1 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans . In January 2024, May 2024, and August 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.12 per share. Dividend payments for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, were 19.6 million and 57.0 million, respectively. In January 2023, May 2023, and August 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.11 per share. Dividend payments for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, were 16.9 million and 51.1 million, respectively. In January 2023, our Board of Directors cancelled the 2021 repurchase program and approved a new repurchase program for up to 2.0 billion of common stock. During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of common stock for 55.1 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of 111.32 per share. In 2024, Teradyne intends, based on market conditions, to repurchase its common stock in an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program. The cumulative repurchases under the 2023 repurchase program as of September 29, 2024, were 4.4 million shares of common stock for 455.6 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price per share of 103.46. During the nine months ended October 1, 2023, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for 346.5 million, which excludes related excise tax, at an average price of 103.89 per share. While we have previously declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. Cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, which will consider, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition. On May 1, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of 400.0 million. On December 10, 2021, the credit agreement was amended to extend the senior secured revolving credit facility to December 10, 2026. On October 5, 2022, the credit agreement was amended to increase the amount of the credit facility to 750.0 million from 400.0 million. On November 7, 2023, the Credit Agreement was amended to allow for the purchase of the shares of Technoprobe. On May 16, 2024, we borrowed 185.0 million under the credit agreement to fund the acquisition of 10 of the issued and outstanding shares of Technoprobe. We fully repaid our borrowings on the revolving credit facility prior to September 29, 2024. As of November 1, 2024, there are no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and senior secured revolving credit facility will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings. Equity Compensation Plans In addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Program as discussed in Note Q: Stock-Based Compensation in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have a 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the 2006 Equity Plan ). The purpose of the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is to encourage stock ownership by all eligible employees of Teradyne. The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to provide equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne to our employees, officers and directors. Both plans were approved by our shareholders. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" , which will require us to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") on an annual and interim basis as well as provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, we will be required to disclose the title and position of the CODM. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. This ASU will have no impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

 39 

Upon adoption, we will apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior period disclosures presented in the financial statements. In December 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires expanded disclosures relating to the tax rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and income tax expense (benefit), requiring a greater disaggregation of information for each. The provisions of ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments in this update should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. This ASU will have no impact on results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks For Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk affecting Teradyne, see Part 2 Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. There were no material changes in our exposure to market risk from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Item 4: Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 29, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1: Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters. Teradyne believes that it has meritorious defenses against all pending claims and intends to vigorously contest them. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of any pending claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise, Teradyne believes the potential losses associated with all of these actions are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. Item 1A: Risk Factors In addition to other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including the risk discussed below, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, remain applicable to our business. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

Exhibit 10.1 EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT 	EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 14 th day of November, 2023, by and between Teradyne, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, Teradyne ), and the undersigned executive officer Employee ). WITNESSETH: 	WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee s employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne. 	NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 	1.	 Entitlements Upon a Termination Event . If, within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below: (a) Treatment of Awards . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee s existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof. (b) Acceleration of Equity Awards . All of Employee s unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award. (c) Satisfaction of Performance Criteria . All of Employee s Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following 

manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, target level is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of each calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event. (d) Salary Continuation . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to 1/12 th of Employee s current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the Salary Continuation Period ). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne s customary pay practices. Subject to Section 1(e)(i) of this Agreement but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the continued payments to Employee contemplated by this Section 1(d) and any benefits provided to Employee that are subject to Section 409A of the Code shall commence on the 60 th day following the Termination Event provided Employee has complied with the requirements of Section 1(g) of this Agreement and the release of claims has become irrevocable under applicable law no later than on the 60 th day following his Termination Event. (e) Deferred Compensation/Section 409A. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a specified employee at the time of the Employee s separation from service as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee s separation from service that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee). 		(ii)	For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the short term deferral period as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless 

 2 

applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A. 		(iii)	This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section. 			(iv)	If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee s expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply: (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations. (f) Benefit Continuation . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and savings plan plus , profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event. To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee s after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs. (g) Release . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general 

 3 

release, in the form of Attachment A to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee s written request. All rights, benefits, payments and other entitlements contemplated to be provided or paid to Employee under this Agreement shall be forfeited as of the 60 th day following Employee s Termination Event if Employee has not provided Teradyne with a valid, irrevocable release of claims as of such 60 th day. (h) Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: Cash Awards shall mean any cash-based bonus, cash incentive or other cash awards provided by Teradyne to Employee pursuant to incentive plans that Teradyne maintains, including but not limited to its 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan. Cause shall mean conduct involving one or more of the following: (i) the substantial and continuing failure of Employee, after notice thereof, to render services to Teradyne in accordance with the terms or requirements of his or her employment as established by the Teradyne Board of Directors from time to time and communicated to the Employee; (ii) Employee s disloyalty, gross negligence, willful misconduct, dishonesty, fraud or breach of fiduciary duty to Teradyne, each in connection with Employee s employment by Teradyne; (iii) Employee s deliberate disregard of the rules or policies of, or breach of an agreement with, Teradyne which results in direct or indirect material loss, damage or injury to Teradyne; (iv) the intentional unauthorized disclosure by Employee of any trade secret or confidential information of Teradyne; (v) the commission by Employee of an act which constitutes unfair competition with Teradyne; or (vi) the conviction of, or the entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the Employee, to any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony. In the event that Teradyne determines that Cause may exist pursuant to clauses (i), (iii) and (v) above, Teradyne shall give Employee written notice of the facts constituting such Cause and Employee shall have 30 days following receipt of such notice to remedy such Cause. 		A Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any consolidation, cash tender offer, reorganization, recapitalization, merger or plan of share exchange following which the capital stock of Teradyne outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitutes less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the combined corporation or person immediately after such transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of Teradyne s assets; (iii) the adoption by the Board of Directors of Teradyne of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Teradyne; (iv) a change in the majority of the Board of Directors of Teradyne through one or more contested elections occurring within a three-year period; or (v) any person (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becomes beneficial owner of 30 or more of the combined voting power of Teradyne s outstanding voting securities, other than (A) as a result of a consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, merger or plan of share exchange following which the capital stock of Teradyne outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitutes at least a majority of combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the 

 4 

combined corporation or person immediately after such transaction, (B) by any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of Teradyne, or (C) by a person temporarily acquiring beneficial ownership in its capacity as an underwriter (as defined pursuant to Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) in connection with a public offering of Teradyne securities. 		 Equity Awards shall mean the equity ownership, participation or appreciation opportunities provided by Teradyne to Employee pursuant to incentive plans that Teradyne maintains, including but not limited to its 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan, the Teradyne, Inc. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan and the Teradyne, Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and any stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock and other stock-based awards granted thereunder.

Model Compensation shall mean Employee s annual Model Compensation as determined by Teradyne s Compensation Committee or Board of Directors, which consists of (i) a fixed annual salary and (ii) a target annual variable amount. Performance Criteria shall have the meaning ascribed to that term in the Teradyne, Inc. 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan. Termination Event shall mean (i) any termination of Employee by Teradyne without Cause or (ii) any voluntary termination by Employee for Good Reason; provided, that it shall not be a Termination Event merely because Employee ceases to be employed by Teradyne and becomes employed by a successor to Teradyne involved in the Change in Control that assumes or is otherwise bound by this Agreement as provided in Section 7(a). It is expressly understood that no Termination Event shall be deemed to have occurred merely because, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, Employee ceases to be employed by Teradyne and does not become employed by a successor to Teradyne after the Change in Control if the successor 

 5 

makes an offer to employ Employee on terms and conditions which, if imposed by Teradyne, would not give Employee a basis on which to terminate employment for Good Reason. (i)	 Termination in Contemplation of a Change in Control . For purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation, this Section 1, a Termination Event occurring in contemplation of a Change in Control means a Termination Event occurring within 3 months prior to an actual Change in Control at the request or direction of a person who enters or has entered into an agreement the consummation of which would cause a Change in Control or who conditions the entry into such an agreement on the Employee s termination whether or not such person actually enters into such an agreement. A termination by the Employee for Good Reason shall constitute a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control if the actions constituting Good Reason were taken at the request or direction of a person who has entered into an agreement the consummation of which would cause a Change in Control. 2.	 Reduction of Payments 	(a)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that the Company undergoes a Change in Ownership or Control (as defined below), the Company shall not be obligated to provide to the Executive a portion of any Contingent Compensation Payments (as defined below) that the Executive would otherwise be entitled to receive to the extent necessary to eliminate any excess parachute payments (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code )) for the Executive. For purposes of this Section 2, the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Payments and the aggregate amount (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-30 or any successor provision) of the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Amount. (b)	For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: (i)	 Change in Ownership or Control shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. (ii)	 Contingent Compensation Payment shall mean any payment (or benefit) in the nature of compensation that is made or made available (under this Agreement or otherwise) to a disqualified individual (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and that is contingent (within the meaning of Section 280G (b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) on a Change in Ownership or Control of the Company. (c)	If and to the extent that any Contingent Compensation Payments are required to be treated as Eliminated Payments pursuant to this Section 2, then the Payments shall be reduced or eliminated, as determined by the Company, in the following order (i) any cash payments, (ii) any taxable benefits, (iii) any nontaxable benefits and (iv) any vesting of equity 

 6 

awards, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments or benefits that are to be paid the farthest in time from the date that triggers the applicability of the excise tax, to the extent necessary to maximize the Eliminated Payments. 	3.	(a) 	 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation . From the Termination Event through the end of the Salary Continuation Period, Employee shall not directly or indirectly: (i) Engage in any business or enterprise (whether as an owner, partner, officer, employee, director, investor, lender, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, except as the holder of not more than 1 of the combined voting power of the outstanding stock of a publicly held company) that is competitive with Teradyne (including but not limited to, any business or enterprise that develops, designs, produces, markets, sells or renders any product or service competitive with any product or service developed, produced, marketed, sold or rendered by Teradyne while Employee was employed by Teradyne); 

 (ii) Either alone or in association with others, recruit, solicit, hire or engage as an independent contractor, any person who was employed by Teradyne at any time during the period of Employee's employment with Teradyne, except for an individual whose employment with Teradyne has been terminated for a period of six months or longer; and 

 (iii) Either alone or in association with others, solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away, the business or patronage of any client or customer or entity that was a prospective client or customer of Teradyne during the Employee's employment. 

 (b)	If any restriction set forth in this Section 3 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable. (c)	Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 3 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee agrees that any breach of this Section 3 will cause Teradyne irreparable harm and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, Teradyne shall have the right to seek equitable and/or injunctive relief. (d)	The geographic scope of this Section 3 shall extend to anywhere Teradyne or any of its subsidiaries is doing business, has done business or has plans to do business. (e)	Employee agrees that during the Salary Continuation Period, he will make reasonable good faith efforts to give verbal notice to Teradyne of each new business 

 7 

activity he plans to undertake, at least (5) business days prior to beginning any such activity. (f)	If Employee violates the provisions of this Section 3, Teradyne shall be entitled to suspend and recoup any salary continuation payment made per Section 1 (d) above and Employee shall continue to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 for an additional period of time equal to the duration of the violation, such additional period not to exceed 24 months. 3A.	 No Obligation of Employment . Employee understands that the employment relationship between Employee and Teradyne will be at will and Employee understands that, prior to any Change in Control, Teradyne may terminate Employee with or without Cause at any time, including in contemplation of a Change in Control.

Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts. 	5.	 Severability . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law. 	6.	 Waivers and Modifications . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6.

Assignment . 	(a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its subsidiaries would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee s employment terminated for Good Reason following a 

 8 

Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, Teradyne shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control. 	(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder. 	(c) This Agreement, and Employee s and Teradyne s rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void. 	(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee s devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee s estate. 	8.	 Entire Agreement . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that Employee s existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments. 	9.	 Notices . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows: 	If to Teradyne, to:	Teradyne, Inc. 600 Riverpark Drive MS NR600-2-2 (Legal Department) North Reading, MA 01864 Attention: General Counsel

If to Employee, at Employee s address in his employment file on record with the Human Resources Department. 	10.	 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 	11.	 Section Headings . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof. 	12.	 Term . The term of this Agreement (the Term shall commence upon the Effective Date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that e mployee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason). 	13.	 Expenses . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee s request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne s successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee s own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13). 	14.	 Payments . Any payments hereunder shall be made out of the general assets of Teradyne. The Employee shall have the status of general unsecured creditor of Teradyne, and this Agreement constitutes a mere promise by Teradyne to make payments under this Agreement in the future as and to the extent provided herein.

Exhibit 10.2 EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT 	EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT entered into this 23 rd day of August, 2024, by and between Teradyne, Inc. (including its subsidiaries, Teradyne ), and the undersigned executive officer Employee ). WITNESSETH: 	WHEREAS, Teradyne and Employee desire to set forth certain terms and conditions relating to the termination of Employee s employment upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) of Teradyne. 	NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 	1.	 Entitlements Upon a Termination Event . If, within twenty-four (24) months following a Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, there is a Termination Event, and subject to the conditions set forth herein and the performance by Employee of the undertakings and duties set forth herein, Employee shall be entitled to the rights, payments and other benefits set forth below: (a) Treatment of Awards . Equity Awards that are not subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(b) below, and Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be governed by Section 1(c) below. The parties hereto acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Agreement are intended to modify the terms of Employee s existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements and to be a supplement to Cash Award and Equity Award agreements granted on or subsequent to the date hereof. (b) Acceleration of Equity Awards . All of Employee s unvested or unexercisable Equity Awards or Equity Awards subject to restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, granted prior to, on, or after the date hereof (but only (I) such Equity Awards as have been granted to Employee by Teradyne as of the date of the Change in Control or (II) such Equity Awards as have been assumed by an acquiring company at the time of a Change in Control or such new cash and equity awards that have been substituted by an acquiring company for Equity Awards existing at the time of a Change in Control, each pursuant to the terms of any Teradyne incentive plan) shall automatically become fully vested, exercisable or free of restrictions on transfer imposed by Teradyne or repurchase rights in favor of Teradyne, as applicable, as of the date of such Termination Event, and all Equity Awards granted on or after the date hereof shall, to the extent applicable, remain exercisable for the remainder of the generally applicable term of such Equity Award. (c) Satisfaction of Performance Criteria . All of Employee s Cash Awards and Equity Awards that are subject to Performance Criteria shall be settled and paid in the following 

manner: Employee shall be deemed to have satisfied the necessary percentage of the Performance Criteria to which such Cash Awards and Equity Awards are subject as of the date of the Termination Event, that will provide Employee with the target level of such Cash Awards and Equity Awards; and Employee shall be entitled to receive that portion of each Cash Award and Equity Award payable, at the target level. For purposes of the Cash Awards, the payment shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of calendar months that have passed during the period in which the Performance Criteria are to be measured (treating the month in which the Termination Event occurs as a full calendar month) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of calendar months in such period. For purposes of this Agreement, target level is that percentage of the Performance Criteria established at the beginning of each calendar year in order for the Employee to achieve Model Compensation. Unless otherwise required under Section 1(e) below, such Cash Awards and Equity Awards shall be paid to Employee or the restrictions on transfer removed not later than 10 days following the Termination Event. (d) Salary Continuation . Unless otherwise required under Section 1 (e) below, Teradyne shall pay Employee monthly an amount equal to 1/12 th of Employee s current annual Model Compensation as of the Termination Event for a period of 24 months following the date of the Termination Event (the Salary Continuation Period ). In the event a Termination Event constitutes termination for Good Reason on account of a material reduction in Model Compensation, the payment obligation pursuant to this Section 1(d) shall be calculated without giving effect to any such reductions in Model Compensation. All such continued payments shall be made in accordance with Teradyne s customary pay practices. Subject to Section 1(e)(i) of this Agreement but notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the continued payments to Employee contemplated by this Section 1(d) and any benefits provided to Employee that are subject to Section 409A of the Code shall commence on the 60 th day following the Termination Event provided Employee has complied with the requirements of Section 1(g) of this Agreement and the release of claims has become irrevocable under applicable law no later than on the 60 th day following his Termination Event. (e) Deferred Compensation/Section 409A. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Employee is a specified employee at the time of the Employee s separation from service as defined in Section 409A of the Code , all payments, benefits, or removal of restrictions on the transfer of equity under this Agreement with respect to the Employee s separation from service that constitute compensation deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan as defined in Section 409A of the Code to which such specified employee would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service shall be made on the first day of the seventh month after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Employee). 		(ii)	For purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments that are due within the short term deferral period as defined in Section 409A or payments that are made under separation pay plans as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(ii), (iii) or (iv), shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless 

 2 

applicable law requires otherwise. Neither Teradyne nor the Employee shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any payments or benefits under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section 409A. 		(iii)	This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and the Agreement shall, to the extent practicable, be construed in accordance therewith. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. In any event, Teradyne makes no representations or warranty and shall have no liability to Employee or any other person if any provisions of or payments under this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but not to satisfy the conditions of that section. 			(iv)	If any amount is payable under the provisions of paragraph (f), below, as a reimbursement of Employee s expenses, under the provisions of Section 2 and 13, or any other provision of this Agreement that constitutes a reimbursement of expenses under Section 409A then, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement with respect to the payment of such reimbursement, the following limitations shall apply: (A) the expenses eligible for reimbursement may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (B) such reimbursement must be made on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expenses are incurred; (C) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; and (D) in connection with reimbursements under Section 13 the period during which such expenses can be incurred extends to the end of the period permitted for such claims under the applicable statute of limitations. (f) Benefit Continuation . During the Salary Continuation Period, Teradyne shall arrange or provide for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for the Employee at the same levels of coverage in existence prior to the Termination Event subject to Teradyne and Employee each contributing to the applicable insurance premium payments on the same basis and in the same proportions as in existence at the date of the Termination Event. If the Employee is not eligible for continued health, dental and vision insurance plan coverage for any portion of the twenty-four (24) month period defined herein, Teradyne shall provide or reimburse Employee for comparable individual insurance and, if such provision or reimbursement constitutes taxable income to the Employee, such additional amount as is necessary to place the Employee in substantially the same after tax position as he was while an employee of Teradyne with respect to such insurance plan coverages. All other benefits, including but not limited to flex/vacation time accrual, short and long term disability insurance, life insurance, contributions (including company matches) into savings plan and savings plan plus , profit sharing payments and participation in the Employee stock purchase plan shall cease as of the date of the Termination Event. To the extent that amounts paid by Teradyne to provide the benefits under this paragraph (f) are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, then such payments shall be made monthly and any payment to preserve the Employee s after tax position shall be made within 60 days after the end of each calendar year in which the taxable provision or reimbursement occurs. (g) Release . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no payment, benefit or removal of restriction on the transfer of equity provided for under or by virtue of the provisions of this Agreement shall be paid or otherwise made available unless Teradyne shall have first received from Employee a valid, binding and irrevocable general 

 3 

release, in the form of Attachment A to this Agreement within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Termination Event. Employee shall sign such release within twenty-one (21) days of a Termination Event subsequent to a Change in Control. Teradyne agrees to provide Employee an estimate relating to payments to be made under this Agreement upon Employee s written request. All rights, benefits, payments and other entitlements contemplated to be provided or paid to Employee under this Agreement shall be forfeited as of the 60 th day following Employee s Termination Event if Employee has not provided Teradyne with a valid, irrevocable release of claims as of such 60 th day. (h) Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings: Cash Awards shall mean any cash-based bonus, cash incentive or other cash awards provided by Teradyne to Employee pursuant to incentive plans that Teradyne maintains, including but not limited to its 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan.

In the event that Teradyne determines that Cause may exist pursuant to clauses (i), (iii) and (v) above, Teradyne shall give Employee written notice of the facts constituting such Cause and Employee shall have 30 days following receipt of such notice to remedy such Cause. 		A Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) any consolidation, cash tender offer, reorganization, recapitalization, merger or plan of share exchange following which the capital stock of Teradyne outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitutes less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the combined corporation or person immediately after such transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of Teradyne s assets; (iii) the adoption by the Board of Directors of Teradyne of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Teradyne; (iv) a change in the majority of the Board of Directors of Teradyne through one or more contested elections occurring within a three-year period; or (v) any person (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becomes beneficial owner of 30 or more of the combined voting power of Teradyne s outstanding voting securities, other than (A) as a result of a consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, merger or plan of share exchange following which the capital stock of Teradyne outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitutes at least a majority of combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the 

 4 

combined corporation or person immediately after such transaction, (B) by any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of Teradyne, or (C) by a person temporarily acquiring beneficial ownership in its capacity as an underwriter (as defined pursuant to Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) in connection with a public offering of Teradyne securities. 		 Equity Awards shall mean the equity ownership, participation or appreciation opportunities provided by Teradyne to Employee pursuant to incentive plans that Teradyne maintains, including but not limited to its 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan, the Teradyne, Inc. 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan and the Teradyne, Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, and any stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock and other stock-based awards granted thereunder.

Model Compensation shall mean Employee s annual Model Compensation as determined by Teradyne s Compensation Committee or Board of Directors, which consists of (i) a fixed annual salary and (ii) a target annual variable amount.

Termination Event shall mean (i) any termination of Employee by Teradyne without Cause or (ii) any voluntary termination by Employee for Good Reason; provided, that it shall not be a Termination Event merely because Employee ceases to be employed by Teradyne and becomes employed by a successor to Teradyne involved in the Change in Control that assumes or is otherwise bound by this Agreement as provided in Section 7(a). It is expressly understood that no Termination Event shall be deemed to have occurred merely because, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, Employee ceases to be employed by Teradyne and does not become employed by a successor to Teradyne after the Change in Control if the successor 

 5 

makes an offer to employ Employee on terms and conditions which, if imposed by Teradyne, would not give Employee a basis on which to terminate employment for Good Reason.

For purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation, this Section 1, a Termination Event occurring in contemplation of a Change in Control means a Termination Event occurring within 3 months prior to an actual Change in Control at the request or direction of a person who enters or has entered into an agreement the consummation of which would cause a Change in Control or who conditions the entry into such an agreement on the Employee s termination whether or not such person actually enters into such an agreement. A termination by the Employee for Good Reason shall constitute a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control if the actions constituting Good Reason were taken at the request or direction of a person who has entered into an agreement the consummation of which would cause a Change in Control. 2.	 Reduction of Payments 	(a)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that the Company undergoes a Change in Ownership or Control (as defined below), the Company shall not be obligated to provide to the Executive a portion of any Contingent Compensation Payments (as defined below) that the Executive would otherwise be entitled to receive to the extent necessary to eliminate any excess parachute payments (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code )) for the Executive. For purposes of this Section 2, the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Payments and the aggregate amount (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-30 or any successor provision) of the Contingent Compensation Payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the Eliminated Amount. (b)	For purposes of this Section 2, the following terms shall have the following respective meanings: (i)	 Change in Ownership or Control shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. (ii)	 Contingent Compensation Payment shall mean any payment (or benefit) in the nature of compensation that is made or made available (under this Agreement or otherwise) to a disqualified individual (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) and that is contingent (within the meaning of Section 280G (b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) on a Change in Ownership or Control of the Company. (c)	If and to the extent that any Contingent Compensation Payments are required to be treated as Eliminated Payments pursuant to this Section 2, then the Payments shall be reduced or eliminated, as determined by the Company, in the following order (i) any cash payments, (ii) any taxable benefits, (iii) any nontaxable benefits and (iv) any vesting of equity 

 6 

awards, in each case in reverse order beginning with the payments or benefits that are to be paid the farthest in time from the date that triggers the applicability of the excise tax, to the extent necessary to maximize the Eliminated Payments. 	3.	(a) 	 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation . From the Termination Event through the end of the Salary Continuation Period, Employee shall not directly or indirectly: (i) Engage in any business or enterprise (whether as an owner, partner, officer, employee, director, investor, lender, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, except as the holder of not more than 1 of the combined voting power of the outstanding stock of a publicly held company) that is competitive with Teradyne (including but not limited to, any business or enterprise that develops, designs, produces, markets, sells or renders any product or service competitive with any product or service developed, produced, marketed, sold or rendered by Teradyne while Employee was employed by Teradyne); 

 (ii) Either alone or in association with others, recruit, solicit, hire or engage as an independent contractor, any person who was employed by Teradyne at any time during the period of Employee's employment with Teradyne, except for an individual whose employment with Teradyne has been terminated for a period of six months or longer; and 

 (iii) Either alone or in association with others, solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert or to take away, the business or patronage of any client or customer or entity that was a prospective client or customer of Teradyne during the Employee's employment. 

 (b)	If any restriction set forth in this Section 3 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable. (c)	Employee acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 3 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of Teradyne and are considered by Employee to be reasonable for such purpose. Employee agrees that any breach of this Section 3 will cause Teradyne irreparable harm and therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to such other remedies that may be available, Teradyne shall have the right to seek equitable and/or injunctive relief. (d)	The geographic scope of this Section 3 shall extend to anywhere Teradyne or any of its subsidiaries is doing business, has done business or has plans to do business.

No Obligation of Employment . Employee understands that the employment relationship between Employee and Teradyne will be at will and Employee understands that, prior to any Change in Control, Teradyne may terminate Employee with or without Cause at any time, including in contemplation of a Change in Control. Following any Change in Control, Teradyne may also terminate Employee with or without c ause at any time subject to Employee s rights and Teradyne s obligations specified in this Agreement. 	4.	 Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this Agreement shall be deemed to be performable in Massachusetts. 	5.	 Severability . In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed to the maximum extent permitted by law. 	6.	 Waivers and Modifications . This Agreement may be modified, and the rights, remedies and obligations contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section 6. No waiver by either party of any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, discharge or termination is sought. 	7.	 Assignment . 	(a) Teradyne shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of Teradyne expressly to assume and agree to perform under the terms of this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Teradyne and its subsidiaries would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place (provided that such a requirement to perform which arises by operation of law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for such an express assumption and agreement), and in such event Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) shall have no further obligation under or with respect to this Agreement. Failure of Teradyne to obtain such assumption and agreement with respect to Employee prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of the terms of this Agreement with respect to Employee and shall entitle Employee to compensation from Teradyne (as constituted prior to such succession) in the same amount and on the same terms as Employee would be entitled to hereunder were Employee s employment terminated for Good Reason following a 

 8 

Change in Control, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date of the Termination Event. As used in this Agreement, Teradyne shall mean Teradyne as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees (or is otherwise required) to perform this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall be deemed to cause any event or condition which would otherwise constitute a Change in Control not to constitute a Change in Control. 	(b) Notwithstanding Section 7(a), Teradyne shall remain liable to Employee upon a Termination Event after a Change in Control if Employee is not offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne or is offered continuing employment by a successor to Teradyne only on a basis which would constitute Good Reason for termination of employment hereunder. 	(c) This Agreement, and Employee s and Teradyne s rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by Employee or, except as provided in Section 7(a), Teradyne, respectively; any purported assignment by Employee or Teradyne in violation hereof shall be null and void. 	(d) The terms of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, permitted successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees of Employee. If Employee shall die while an amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder if they had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee s devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, Employee s estate. 	8.	 Entire Agreement . This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all agreements, written or oral, made prior to the date hereof between Employee and Teradyne relating to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that Employee s existing Cash Award and Equity Award agreements, as modified hereby, shall remain in effect. This Agreement shall not limit any right of Employee to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or Employee compensation plan of Teradyne, initially adopted as of or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder); provided that in no event shall Employee be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Employee under any severance or similar plan or policy of Teradyne, and in any such case Employee shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments. 	9.	 Notices . All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered in person or mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows: 	If to Teradyne, to:	Teradyne, Inc. 600 Riverpark Drive MS NR600-2-2 (Legal Department) North Reading, MA 01864 Attention: General Counsel 

 9 

If to Employee, at Employee s address in his employment file on record with the Human Resources Department. 	10.	 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 	11.	 Section Headings . The descriptive section headings herein have been inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to define, limit, or otherwise affect the construction of any provision hereof. 	12.	 Term . The term of this Agreement (the Term shall commence upon the Effective Date hereof and terminate upon the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months following any Change in Control of Teradyne, (ii) the date prior to any Change in Control of Teradyne that e mployee for any reason ceases to be an employee of Teradyne (other than a Termination Event in contemplation of a Change in Control) and (iii) the date following any Change in Control of Teradyne that Employee is terminated for Cause or voluntary terminates his employment (other than for Good Reason). 	13.	 Expenses . All reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in a legal proceeding by Employee in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Agreement against a successor to Teradyne shall be the responsibility of and paid for by the successor to Teradyne (but not Teradyne as constituted prior to such succession). Such payments are to be made within twenty (20) days after Employee s request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Teradyne s successor reasonably may require; provided that if Employee institutes a proceeding and the judge or other decision-maker presiding over the proceeding affirmatively finds that Employee has failed to prevail substantially, Employee shall pay Employee s own costs and expenses (and, if applicable, return any amounts theretofore paid on Employee's behalf under this Section 13). 	14.	 Payments . Any payments hereunder shall be made out of the general assets of Teradyne. The Employee shall have the status of general unsecured creditor of Teradyne, and this Agreement constitutes a mere promise by Teradyne to make payments under this Agreement in the future as and to the extent provided herein. Unless otherwise determined by Teradyne in an applicable plan or arrangement, no amounts payable hereunder upon a Termination Event shall be deemed salary or compensation for the purpose of computing benefits under any employee benefit plan or other arrangement of Teradyne for the benefit of its employees. Teradyne shall be entitled to withhold from any payments or deemed payments any amount of tax withholding required by law.
