 The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger (defined in Note 12), the Company acquired a controlling interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC (Eureka Midstream Holdings) and an equity method investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (the MVP Joint Venture). 
 
 Eureka Midstream Holdings is a joint venture that owns a gathering header pipeline system that is operated by a subsidiary of EQT. Because the Company is the primary beneficiary of Eureka Midstream Holdings, the Company consolidates Eureka Midstream Holdings and records noncontrolling interest in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 7 for discussion of the revolving credit facility of Eureka Midstream, LLC (Eureka), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eureka Midstream Holdings. 
 
 The MVP Joint Venture is a joint venture formed among a subsidiary of EQT and, as applicable, affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Consolidated Edison, Inc., AltaGas Ltd. and RGC Resources, Inc. for purposes of constructing and operating the Mountain Valley Pipeline (the MVP) and the MVP Southgate project (MVP Southgate). See Note 8 for further discussion of the MVP Joint Venture, the MVP and MVP Southgate. Because the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the MVP Joint Venture but does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the MVP Joint Venture's economic performance, the Company applies the equity method of accounting to the MVP Joint Venture.

 reportable segment. Historically, the Company administered all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments and measured financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area-by-area basis. 
 
 As a result of the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company adjusted its internal reporting structure and the Company's chief operating decision maker changed the manner in which he allocates resources and measures financial performance to incorporate the gathering and transmission assets acquired by the Company in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Hence, the Company's operations expanded to comprise discrete operating segments reflective of its lines of business consisting of Production, Gathering and Transmission. Accordingly, the manner in which the Company reports its operations has been changed retrospectively, with certain prior period amounts recast between Production and Gathering.

 (b) Gathering capital expenditures included capital expenditures attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings of approximately million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Notes 1 and 12. 
 
 Intersegment contracts 
 
 On February 26, 2020, EQT and certain of its affiliates (such parties, collectively, the EQT Producer) entered into a gas gathering and compression agreement (the Consolidated GGA) with an affiliate of EQM Midstream Partners, LP (EQM), which became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of EQT upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Pursuant to the terms of the Consolidated GGA, among other things, the EQM affiliate agreed to provide gas gathering services to the EQT Producer, and the EQT Producer committed to an initial annual minimum volume commitment (MVC) of Bcf per day and an acreage dedication in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Consolidated GGA is effective through December 31, 2035 and will renew annually thereafter unless terminated by the parties thereto.

months thereafter or December 31, 2024. Such payments are conditioned upon the quarterly average of the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas settlement price exceeding certain price thresholds. Upon commencement of long-term firm capacity obligations, the MVP In-Service Date occurred on July 1, 2024. See Note 8. 
 
 The EQT Producer's derivative liability and any gain or loss realized related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus are included in the Company's Production segment; the EQM affiliate's derivative asset and any gain or loss realized related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus are included in the Company's Gathering segment. All balances and gains or losses related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus have been eliminated in consolidation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the derivative related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus had a fair value of approximately million and million, respectively. The fair value of the derivative asset and liability related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus is based on significant inputs that are interpolated from observable market data and, as such, is a Level 2 fair value measurement. See Note 5 for a description of the fair value hierarchy.

 days of the end of the calendar month in which the commodity is delivered. A significant number of these contracts contain variable consideration because the payment terms refer to market prices at future delivery dates. In these situations, the Company has not identified a standalone selling price because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the Company's efforts to satisfy the performance obligations. Other contracts, such as fixed price contracts or contracts with a fixed differential to New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) or index prices, contain fixed consideration. The fixed consideration is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, which requires judgment from management. For these contracts, the Company generally concludes that the fixed price or fixed differentials in the contracts are representative of the standalone selling price. 
 
 Based on management's judgment, the performance obligations for the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil are satisfied at a point in time because the customer obtains control and legal title of the asset when the natural gas, NGLs or oil is delivered to the designated sales point. 
 
 The sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil presented in the Statements of Condensed Consolidated Operations represent the Company's share of revenues net of royalties and exclude revenue interests owned by others. When selling natural gas, NGLs and oil on behalf of royalty or working interest owners, the Company acts as an agent and, thus, reports the revenue on a net basis. 
 
 Pipeline revenue. The Company recognizes revenue under gathering and transmission and storage contracts when it satisfies certain performance obligations. 
 
 The Company provides firm and interruptible gathering and transmission and storage services. Firm service contracts generally require the customer to pay a firm reservation fee, which is a fixed, monthly charge to reserve an agreed upon amount of pipeline or storage capacity regardless of whether the customer uses the capacity. Volumetric-based fees, which are charges based on the volume of gas gathered, transported or stored, can also be charged under firm contracts for each firm contracted volume gathered, transported or stored, as well as for volumes gathered, transported or stored in excess of the firm contracted volume so long as capacity exists. Interruptible service contracts require the customer to pay volumetric-based fees and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline or storage facility. 
 
 Gathering and transmission and storage services contracts can be short-term or long-term in duration. Firm and interruptible gathering service contracts are invoiced on a lag, with payment typically due within days of the invoice date. Revenue for gathering services provided but not yet invoiced is estimated based on contract data, preliminary throughput and allocation measurements on a monthly basis. Firm and interruptible transmission and storage service contracts are invoiced at the end of each calendar month, with payment typically due within days of the invoice date.

 Bcf of natural gas and thousand barrels (Mbbl) of NGLs as of September 30, 2024 and Bcf of natural gas and Mbbl of NGLs as of December 31, 2023. The open positions at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 had maturities extending through December 2027. 
 
 Certain of the Company's OTC derivative instrument contracts provide that, if EQT's credit rating assigned by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), S P Global Ratings (S P) or Fitch Ratings Service (Fitch) is below the agreed-upon credit rating threshold (typically, below investment grade) and if the associated derivative liability exceeds the agreed-upon dollar threshold for such credit rating, the counterparty to such contract can require the Company to deposit collateral. Similarly, if such counterparty's credit rating assigned by Moody's, S P or Fitch is below the agreed-upon credit rating threshold and if the associated derivative liability exceeds the agreed-upon dollar threshold for such credit rating, the Company can require the counterparty to deposit collateral with the Company. Such collateral can be up to of the derivative liability. Investment grade refers to the quality of a company's credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. To be considered investment grade, a company must be rated "Baa3" or higher by Moody's, "BBB " or higher by S P and "BBB " or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade. As of September 30, 2024, EQT's senior notes were rated "Baa3" by Moody's, "BBB " by S P and "BBB " by Fitch.

 The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The carrying value of borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility (defined in Note 7) approximates fair value as each facility's interest rate is based on prevailing market rates. The Company considers all of these fair values to be Level 1 fair value measurements.

 and , respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily as a result of recognition of tax benefits related to higher losses on the Company's state tax-paying entities and the utilization of some its capital loss carryforwards with the capital gain generated from the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, which resulted in the release of the associated valuation allowance. The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the release of valuation allowances limiting certain state deferred tax assets and net state deferred tax benefits related to a rate reduction from a Pennsylvania tax law change enacted in July 2022 and the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition.

 years on a straight-line basis, which reflects the pattern in which the Company expects to consume the economic benefits of the assets. 
 
 The fair value of EQM's senior notes was measured using established fair value methodology. Because not all of EQM's senior notes are actively traded, their fair value is a Level 2 fair value measurement. The difference between the fair value and principal amount of the assumed senior notes is amortized over the remaining life of the debt. The unamortized amount is presented as a reduction of debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Because the carrying value of borrowings under EQM's revolving credit facility and Eureka's revolving credit facility approximated their respective fair value (as each facility's interest rate is based on prevailing market rates), the Company considers their fair values to be Level 1 fair value measurements. 
 
 Goodwill is attributable to the Company's qualitative assumptions of long-term value that the Equitrans Midstream Merger creates for EQT shareholders. Of the total goodwill, the Company attributed billion to synergies expected from the vertical integration of the business, including from the elimination of contracted transportation and processing costs with Equitrans Midstream as the Company is unable to recognize intangible assets related to its significant long-term customer contracts with Equitrans Midstream as such contracts became intercompany transactions upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger. In addition, the Company attributed billion of total goodwill to additional deferred tax liabilities that arose from the differences between the preliminary purchase price allocation based on fair value and tax basis that carried over from Equitrans Midstream to the Company. The Company allocated all of the goodwill from the Equitrans Midstream Merger to the Company's Transmission segment. Differences between the preliminary purchase price allocation and the final purchase price allocation may change the amount of goodwill recognized. 
 
 In conjunction with the Equitrans Midstream Merger, as of the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date, the Company had unamortized carryover tax basis of million of tax deductible goodwill.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this report. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references in this report to "EQT" are to EQT Corporation and all references in this report to the "Company," "we," "us," or "our" are to EQT Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. For certain industry specific terms used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, please see "Glossary of Commonly Used Terms, Abbreviations and Measurements" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts are forward-looking and are usually identified by the use of words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "could," "would," "will," "may," "forecast," "approximate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words of similar meaning, or the negative thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the matters discussed in the section "Trends and Uncertainties" and expectations of our plans, strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance, including guidance regarding our strategy to develop our reserves; drilling plans and programs, including availability of capital to complete these plans and programs; total resource potential and drilling inventory duration; projected production and sales volume, including liquified natural gas (LNG) volumes and sales; natural gas prices; changes in basis and the impact of commodity prices on our business; potential future impairments of our assets; projected well costs and capital expenditures; infrastructure programs; the cost, capacity and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals; our ability to successfully implement and execute our operational, organizational, technological and environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, and achieve the anticipated results of such initiatives; projected gathering and compression rates; potential divestitures, acquisitions or other strategic transactions, the timing thereof and our ability to achieve the intended operational, financial and strategic benefits from any such transactions or from any recently completed strategic transactions, including the Equitrans Midstream Merger (defined and discussed in Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements); the amount and timing of any repayments, redemptions or repurchases of our common stock, outstanding debt securities or other debt instruments; our ability to retire our debt and the timing of such retirements, if any; the projected amount and timing of dividends; projected cash flows and free cash flow, and the timing thereof; liquidity and financing requirements, including funding sources and availability; our ability to maintain or improve our credit ratings, leverage levels and financial profile; our hedging strategy and projected margin posting obligations; the effects of litigation, government regulation and tax position; and the expected impact of changes to tax laws. 
 
 The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We have based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events, taking into account all information currently known by us. While we consider these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, volatility of commodity prices; the costs and results of drilling and operations; uncertainties about estimates of reserves, identification of drilling locations and the ability to add proved reserves in the future; the assumptions underlying production forecasts; the quality of technical data; our ability to appropriately allocate capital and other resources among our strategic opportunities; access to and cost of capital; our hedging and other financial contracts; inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to drilling for, producing, transporting and storing natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and oil; operational risks and hazards incidental to the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas as well as unforeseen interruptions; cyber security risks and acts of sabotage; availability and cost of drilling rigs, completion services, equipment, supplies, personnel, oilfield services and sand and water required to execute our exploration and development plans, including as a result of inflationary pressures; risks associated with operating primarily in the Appalachian Basin; the ability to obtain environmental and other permits and the timing thereof; construction, business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial, environmental, political and legal uncertainties related to the development and construction by us or our joint ventures of pipeline and storage facilities and transmission assets and the optimization of such assets; our ability to renew or replace expiring gathering, transmission or storage contracts at favorable rates on a long-term basis or at all; risks relating to our joint venture arrangements; government regulation or action, including regulations pertaining to methane and other greenhouse gas emissions; negative public perception of the fossil fuels industry; increased consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas; environmental and weather risks, including the possible impacts of climate change; risks related to our ability to integrate the operations of Equitrans Midstream Corporation

 (Equitrans Midstream) in a successful manner and in the expected time period and the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the Equitrans Midstream Merger will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; and disruptions to our business due to recently completed acquisitions and other significant transactions, including the Equitrans Midstream Merger. These and other risks and uncertainties are described under the "Risk Factors" section in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and under the "Risk Factors" section and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and may be updated by other documents we subsequently file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). 
 
 Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and, except as required by law, we do not intend to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Recent Events 
 
 On July 22, 2024, we completed the Equitrans Midstream Merger. As a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we acquired over 2,000 miles of pipeline infrastructure that have extensive overlap and connectivity in our core area of operations, and we became the first large-scale, integrated natural gas producer in the United States. Refer to Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we divested a portion of our non-operated assets in Northeast Pennsylvania (the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture), as discussed in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 29, 2024, we entered into an agreement to divest the remaining interest in our non-operated assets in Northeast Pennsylvania in exchange for 1.25 billion of cash (the Remaining NEPA Non-Operated Assets Divestiture). We intend to use the proceeds from the Remaining NEPA Non-Operated Assets Divestiture for repayment of our debt. The Remaining NEPA Non-Operated Assets Divestiture is subject to customary closing adjustments, required regulatory approvals and clearances. 
 
 Trends and Uncertainties 
 
 The Mountain Valley Pipeline 
 
 Following receipt of authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the FERC), the Mountain Valley Pipeline (the MVP) entered into service on June 14, 2024. Upon commencement of long-term firm capacity obligations, the MVP In-Service Date (defined in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) occurred on July 1, 2024. Our Production segment is committed to an initial 1.29 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of firm capacity on the MVP through June 30, 2044. Accordingly, as a result of the occurrence of the MVP In-Service Date, we expect our Production segment's future (i) transmission expense to increase as a result of the additional contracted capacity and (ii) gathering expense to decrease pursuant to the terms of the Consolidated GGA (defined in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 
 The MVP Joint Venture (defined in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) has continued to make restoration efforts with respect to the MVP. Estimated total project cost of the MVP is approximately 8.1 billion, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Of this amount, 100.4 million was contributed by us following our closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, including the 15.2 million payable as of September 30, 2024, which was paid in October 2024. 
 
 Curtailments and Commodity Prices 
 
 On March 4, 2024, we announced our decision to strategically curtail approximately 1.0 Bcf per day of gross production (the Strategic Curtailment) beginning on February 24, 2024 in response to the low natural gas price environment resulting from warm winter weather and elevated storage inventories. The Strategic Curtailment resulted in total decreased sales volume of 82 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalents (Bcfe) during the period beginning on February 24, 2024 and ending on June 19, 2024 and 25 Bcfe during the period beginning July 4, 2024 and ending on September 30, 2024. In response to market fundamentals, we expect to continue to strategically curtail our production. Our sales volume guidance assumes 10 to 15 Bcfe of curtailments during the fourth quarter of 2024.

 Continued low natural gas prices may result in further adjustments to our 2024 planned development schedule or the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest. Further, we cannot control or otherwise influence the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest. Certain operators of wells in which we have a non-operating working interest also curtailed production in 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we estimate that our total expected sales volume was negatively impacted by approximately 35 Bcfe of curtailments, including our Strategic Curtailment of 25 Bcfe and curtailments by certain operators of wells in which we have a non-operating working interest. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we estimate that our total expected sales volume was negatively impacted by approximately 125 to 130 Bcfe of curtailments, including our Strategic Curtailment of 107 Bcfe and curtailments by certain operators of wells in which we have a non-operating working interest. Adjustments to our 2024 planned development schedule or the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest, including due to declines in natural gas prices, the pace of well completions, access to sand and water to conduct drilling operations, access to sufficient pipeline takeaway capacity, unscheduled downtime at processing facilities or otherwise, could impact our future sales volume, operating revenues and expenses, per unit metrics and capital expenditures. 
 
 The annual inflation rate in the United States remains elevated compared to the rate of inflation over the prior five years. Inflationary pressures have multiple impacts on our business, including increasing our operating expenses and our cost of capital. While the prices for certain of the raw materials and services we use in our operations have generally decreased from the peak prices experienced during 2022, we will not fully realize the benefit of such reduced prices until we enter into new contracts for such materials and services, and inflationary pressures may cause prices to fluctuate. Additionally, certain of our commitments for demand charges under our existing long-term contracts and processing capacity are subject to consumer price index adjustments. Although we believe our scale and supply chain contracting strategy of using multi-year sand and frac crew contracts allows us to maximize capital and operating efficiencies, future increases in the inflation rate will negatively impact our long-term contracts with consumer price index adjustments. 
 
 We expect commodity prices to be volatile through 2024 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, including developments pertaining to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. Our revenue, profitability, liquidity and financial position will continue to be impacted in the future by the market prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, NGLs and oil. 

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 
 Net loss attributable to EQT Corporation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 300.8 million, 0.54 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to EQT Corporation of 81.3 million, 0.20 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The change was attributable primarily to increased other operating expenses, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, a lower gain on derivatives and increased net interest expense, partly offset by decreased transportation and processing expense and increased cash operating revenues, including pipeline revenues, which increased as a result of our operation of assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. 
 
 Net loss attributable to EQT Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 187.8 million, 0.39 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to EQT Corporation of 1,233.2 million, 3.08 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The change was attributable primarily to lower gain on derivatives, decreased sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, increased other operating expenses, increased net interest expense and increased production expense, partly offset by recognition of an income tax benefit in 2024 compared to an income tax expense in 2023, the gain on the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture and increased pipeline revenues, which increased as a result of our operation of assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. 
 
 Results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the results of our operation of assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, which closed on July 22, 2024. See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the results of our operation of assets received as consideration for the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, which closed on May 31, 2024. Such assets received included the remaining 16.25 equity interest in the NEPA Gathering System (defined in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) (which was the sole remaining minority interest following our acquisition of a 33.75 equity interest in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition (defined in Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) on April 11, 2024), resulting in our 100 ownership of the NEPA Gathering System. See Note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Average Realized Price Reconciliation 
 
 The following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of our consolidated operations, including the calculation of our average realized price /Mcfe), which is based on Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure. Production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. Production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to total operating revenues. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation" for a reconciliation of Production adjusted operating revenues from total operating revenues, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation 
 
 The table below reconciles Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, from total operating revenues, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of total operating revenues to EQT Corporation operating revenues as reported in the Statements of Condensed Consolidated Operations. 
 
 Production adjusted operating revenues (also referred to in this report as total natural gas and liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. Production adjusted operating revenues is defined as total operating revenues, less the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and pipeline, net marketing services and other revenues. We believe that Production adjusted operating revenues provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it helps facilitate comparisons of operating performance and earnings trends across periods. Production adjusted operating revenues reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts; thus, the measure excludes the often-volatile revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement. The measure also excludes pipeline, net marketing services and other revenues, which consists of costs of, and recoveries on, pipeline capacity releases and other revenues, because it is unrelated to the revenue from our natural gas and liquids production.

Business Segment Results of Operations 
 
 Operating segments are revenue-producing components of an entity for which separate financial information is produced internally and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and measure financial performance. 
 
 Prior to the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we reported our results of operations as a single consolidated segment. As a result of the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we adjusted our internal reporting structure and our chief operating decision maker changed the manner in which he allocates resources and measures financial performance to incorporate the gathering and transmission assets we acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Hence, our operations expanded to comprise three discrete segments reflective of our three lines of business of Production, Gathering and Transmission. Accordingly, the manner in which we report our operations has been changed retrospectively, with certain prior period amounts recast between Production and Gathering. 
 
 The following sections summarize operating income and certain operational measures by our three reportable segments. We believe this information is useful to investors for evaluating our financial condition, results of operations and trends and uncertainties of our segments. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by business segment.

 Sales volume. Sales volume increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily as a result of sales volume increases of 31 Bcfe from the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition and increases from wells turned-in-line, partly offset by sales volume decreases of 25 Bcfe due to the Strategic Curtailment and decreases of 12 Bcfe due to the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. 
 
 Sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil. Sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to increased sales volume and higher average realized price. 
 
 Average realized price increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to favorable cash settled NYMEX derivatives and favorable average differential, partly offset by lower NYMEX price. The following table presents the composition of net cash settlements received on derivatives. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Thousands) Net cash settlements received on NYMEX natural gas hedge positions 339,283 199,042 Net cash settlements (paid) received on basis and liquids hedge positions (51,147) 56,762 Net cash settlements received on derivatives 288,136 255,804 
 
 Net cash settlements received on derivatives are included in average realized price but may not be included in operating revenues.

 Gain on derivatives. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a gain on derivatives of 72.5 million and 177.9 million related primarily to increases in the fair market value of our NYMEX swaps and options due to decreases in NYMEX forward prices. 
 
 Gathering. Gathering expense decreased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, our Transmission segment's ownership of the transmission and storage assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger and our Gathering segment's ownership of the additional interest in the NEPA Gathering System acquired in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition and as consideration for the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. 
 
 Transmission. Transmission expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to additional contracted capacity, including on the MVP, which commenced long-term firm capacity obligations on July 1, 2024. 
 
 Processing . Processing expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to increased volumes from the development of liquids-rich areas and increased processing expense from the liquids-rich assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition. 
 
 Transportation and processing to affiliate . Affiliate transportation and processing expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, our Transmission segment's ownership of the transmission and storage assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger and our Gathering segment's ownership of the additional interest in the NEPA Gathering System acquired in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition and as consideration for the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. In addition, affiliate transportation and processing expense increased on a per Mcfe basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 LOE. LOE increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to increased LOE from the water assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger and the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition.

Other Income Statement Items 
 
 Other operating expenses . Corporate other operating expenses increased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger of 274.6 million and 298.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, partly offset by lower transaction costs related to the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition.

 Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to interest expense on EQM Midstream Partners, LP's (EQM) senior notes (which we consolidate as a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger), increased interest expense on our borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, interest expense on EQT's 5.750 senior notes issued in January 2024 and lower interest income earned on cash on hand, partly offset by decreased interest expense from our repayment and repurchase of certain of our senior notes, decreased interest expense on the Term Loan Facility due to our partial prepayment in January 2024 as well as higher capitalized interest from the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition. 
 
 Interest expense, net increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to interest expense on EQM's senior notes, lower interest income earned on cash on hand, interest expense on EQT's 5.750 senior notes issued in January 2024, increased interest expense on our borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility and increased interest expense on our borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, partly offset by decreased interest expense from our repayment and repurchase of certain of our senior notes as well as higher capitalized interest from the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition.

 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC (Eureka Midstream Holdings), a consolidated joint venture in which we acquired an equity interest as a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger. See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 
 Although we cannot provide any assurance, we believe cash flows from operating activities and availability under EQT's revolving credit facility should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements inclusive of, but not limited to, normal operating needs, debt service obligations, planned capital expenditures and commitments for at least the next twelve months and, based on current expectations, for the long term. 
 
 Planned Capital Expenditures and Sales Volume . Following the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we revised our estimated total capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2024 to 630 million to 730 million. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and, if required, borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility. Because we are the operator of a high percentage of our developed acreage, the amount and timing of certain of our capital expenditures is largely discretionary. We could choose to defer a portion of our planned 2024 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil; the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital; the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals; and drilling, completion and acquisition costs. In addition, our gathering and transmission businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and maintain and upgrade existing operations. 
 
 We expect our sales volume, including expected curtailments, to be 555 Bcfe to 605 Bcfe for the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements. We have contractual commitments under our debt agreements, including interest payments and principal repayments. As a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, EQM became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of EQT. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of EQM's senior notes. 
 
 In addition, we expect to make total capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in the fourth quarter of 2024 of approximately 70 million to 80 million.

Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 2,071 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,554 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due primarily to higher cash operating expenses (including increased transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger), unfavorable timing of working capital payments, lower cash operating revenues and higher net interest expense, partly offset by higher net cash settlements received on derivatives and lower net premiums paid on derivatives. 
 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are affected by movements in the market price for commodities. We are unable to predict such movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing. For a discussion of potential commodity market risks, refer to "Risk Factors Natural gas, NGLs and oil price volatility, or a prolonged period of low natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, may have an adverse effect on our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was 2,162 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,774 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was attributable primarily to lower cash paid for the Equitrans Midstream Merger and the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition in 2024 compared to cash paid for the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition in 2023 as well as the proceeds received from the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, partly offset by increased capital expenditures. 
 
 The following tables summarize our capital expenditures. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Millions) Production: Reserve development (a) 371 355 1,283 1,147 Land and lease (b) 37 41 105 101 Other production infrastructure 16 17 57 49 Capitalized interest, capitalized overhead and other 31 23 95 70 Total Production 455 436 1,540 1,367 Gathering (c) 80 7 112 12 Transmission 10 10 Other corporate items 13 2 21 8 Total capital expenditures 558 445 1,683 1,387 Add (deduct): Non-cash items (d) 11 59 (21) 99 Total cash capital expenditures 569 504 1,662 1,486 
 (a) Capital expenditures for reserve development included capital expenditures for water infrastructure of 28.9 million and 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 58.7 million and 26.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 (b) Capital expenditures for land and lease included capital expenditures attributable to noncontrolling interest in The Mineral Company LLC of approximately 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Mineral Company LLC was dissolved in the third quarter of 2023. 
 (c) Gathering capital expenditures included capital expenditures attributable to noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings of approximately 1.6 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (d) Represents the net impact of non-cash capital expenditures, including the effect of timing of receivables from working interest partners, accrued capital expenditures, transfers to or from inventory as assets are completed or assigned to a project and capitalized share-based compensation costs. The impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the current period estimate, net of the reversal of the prior period accrual.

 Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was 100 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 174 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the primary sources of financing cash flows were our net borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, proceeds from the issuance of EQT's 5.750 senior notes and proceeds from the net settlement of the Capped Call Transactions (defined in Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), and the primary uses of financing cash flows were our repayment and retirement of debt, repayment of EQM's revolving credit facility and payment of dividends. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the primary source of financing cash flows was proceeds from the Term Loan Facility borrowings, and the primary uses of financing cash flows were our repayment and retirement of debt, repurchase and retirement of EQT common stock and payment of dividends. 
 
 See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our debt and borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility. See Notes 1 and 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of Eureka Midstream, LLC (Eureka), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eureka Midstream Holdings. 
 
 On October 10, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.1575 per share of EQT common stock, payable on December 2, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 6, 2024. 
 
 Depending on our actual and anticipated sources and uses of liquidity, prevailing market conditions and other factors, we may from time to time seek to redeem or repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities through tender offers or other cash purchases in the open market or privately negotiated transactions. The amounts involved in any such transactions may be material. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of redemptions and repurchases of debt. 
 
 Security Ratings and Financing Triggers 
 
 Our credit ratings and rating outlooks are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently from any other rating. We cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency if, in the rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. See Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of what is deemed investment grade. 
 
 The table below reflects the credit ratings and rating outlooks assigned to EQT's debt instruments as of September 30, 2024.

 Changes in credit ratings may affect our access to the capital markets, the cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under EQT's and Eureka's revolving credit facilities, the interest rate on the Term Loan Facility, the interest rate on EQT's senior notes with adjustable rates, the rates available on new long-term debt, our pool of investors and funding sources, the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on our over the counter (OTC) derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements, including collateral, in support of our midstream service contracts, joint venture arrangements or construction contracts. Margin deposits on our OTC derivative instruments are also subject to factors other than credit rating, such as natural gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in the agreements between us and our hedging counterparties.

 Our debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in default or event of default under EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility, mandatory partial or full repayment of amounts outstanding, reduced loan capacity or other similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under our debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change of control provisions. EQT's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility contain financial covenants that require us to have a total debt to total capitalization ratio no greater than 65 . As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all EQT, Eureka and EQM debt provisions and covenants under our debt agreements. 
 
 See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility. 
 
 Commodity Risk Management 
 
 The substantial majority of our commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of our produced natural gas. The overall objective of our hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. The derivative commodity instruments that we use are primarily swap, collar and option agreements. The following table summarizes the approximate volume and prices of our NYMEX hedge positions as of October 25, 2024. The difference between the fixed price and NYMEX price is included in average differential presented in our price reconciliation in "Average Realized Price Reconciliation." The fixed price natural gas sales agreements can be physically or financially settled.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against us. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. We evaluate our legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, on a regular basis and accrue a liability for such matters when we believe that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. In the event we determine that (i) a loss is probable but the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, or (ii) a loss is less likely than probable but is reasonably possible, then we are required to disclose the matter in our Annual Report on Form 10-K with any update thereto in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, although we are not required to accrue such loss. 
 
 When able, we determine an estimate of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for legal proceedings. In instances where such estimates can be made, any such estimates are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties and may change as new information is obtained. 
 
 See Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for discussions of our commitments and contingencies, including certain pending legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingent matters. 
 
 Additionally, in the normal course of business, we are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages or other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting estimates, including a discussion regarding the estimation uncertainty and the impact that our critical accounting estimates have had, or are reasonably likely to have, on our financial condition or results of operations, are described in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and have been updated below. The application of our critical accounting estimates may require us to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We use historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments. Different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. 
 
 Goodwill. Goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. 
 
 Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We use a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. 
 
 We believe goodwill is a "critical accounting estimate" because the valuation of a reporting unit involves significant judgment and is sensitive to changes in assumptions, including changes in our stock price, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. Changes to assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units and the resulting conclusion on impairment could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, future assumptions and estimates may materially differ from current assumptions and estimates.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Commodity Price Risk and Derivative Instruments. Our primary market risk exposure is the volatility of future prices for natural gas and NGLs. Due to the volatility of commodity prices, we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas and NGLs at our ultimate sales points and, thus, cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations. Prolonged low, or significant, extended declines in, natural gas and NGLs prices could adversely affect, among other things, our development plans, which would decrease the pace of development and the level of our proved reserves and, similarly, could adversely affect timing of development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by our pipeline and storage assets and limit growth in, or may reduce the demand for, and usage of, our gathering or transmission and storage services. Price declines and sustained periods of low natural gas and NGLs prices could also have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of our gathering and transmission and storage customers and related ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts. Increases in natural gas and NGLs prices may be accompanied by, or result in, increased well drilling costs, increased production taxes, increased LOE, increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased end-user conservation or conversion to alternative fuels. In addition, to the extent we have hedged our production at prices below the current market price, we will not benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas, and, depending on our then-current credit ratings and the terms of our hedging contracts, we may be required to post additional margin with our hedging counterparties. 
 
 The overall objective of our hedging program is to protect our cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. Our use of derivatives is further described in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and "Commodity Risk Management" under "Capital Resources and Liquidity" in Item 2. Our OTC derivative commodity instruments are placed primarily with financial institutions and the creditworthiness of those institutions is regularly monitored. We primarily enter into derivative instruments to hedge forecasted sales of production. We also enter into derivative instruments to hedge basis. Our use of derivative instruments is implemented under a set of policies approved by our management-level Hedge and Financial Risk Committee and is reviewed by our Board of Directors. 
 
 For derivative commodity instruments used to hedge our forecasted sales of production, which are at, for the most part, NYMEX natural gas prices, we set policy limits relative to the expected production and sales levels that are exposed to price risk. We have an insignificant amount of financial natural gas derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes. 
 
 The derivative commodity instruments we use are primarily swap, collar and option agreements. These agreements may require payments to, or receipt of payments from, counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity. We use these agreements to hedge our NYMEX and basis exposure. We may also use other contractual agreements when executing our commodity hedging strategy. 
 
 We monitor price and production levels on a continuous basis and adjust quantities hedged as warranted. 
 
 A hypothetical decrease of 10 in the NYMEX natural gas price on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 would increase the fair value of our natural gas derivative commodity instruments by approximately 440 million and 204 million, respectively. A hypothetical increase of 10 in the NYMEX natural gas price on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 would decrease the fair value of our natural gas derivative commodity instruments by approximately 434 million and 482 million, respectively. For purposes of this analysis, we applied the 10 change in the NYMEX natural gas price on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to our natural gas derivative commodity instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to calculate the hypothetical change in fair value. The change in fair value was determined using a method similar to our normal process for determining derivative commodity instrument fair value described in Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The above analysis of our derivative commodity instruments does not include the offsetting impact that the same hypothetical price movement may have on our physical sales of natural gas. The portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge our forecasted produced natural gas approximates a portion of our expected physical sales of natural gas; therefore, an adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments held to hedge our forecasted production associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above should be offset by a favorable impact on our physical sales of natural gas, assuming that the derivative commodity instruments are not closed in advance of their expected term and the derivative commodity instruments continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk. 
 
 If the underlying physical transactions or positions are liquidated prior to the maturity of the derivative commodity instruments, a loss on the financial instruments may occur or the derivative commodity instruments might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date, whichever comes first.

Interest Rate Risk. Changes in market interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility. In addition, changes in Eureka's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined in that certain Credit Agreement, dated May 13, 2021, among Eureka, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent, the lenders party thereto from time to time and any other persons party thereto from time to time, as amended, governing Eureka's revolving credit facility (the Eureka Credit Agreement)) as a result on Eureka's liquidity needs, operating results or distributions to its member affect the interest rate Eureka pays on borrowings under its revolving credit facility. None of the interest we pay on our senior notes fluctuates based on changes to market interest rates. A 1 increase in interest rates for the borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have increased interest expense by approximately 9.7 million. 
 
 Interest rates for EQT's revolving credit facility, the Term Loan Facility and EQT's 7.000 senior notes fluctuate based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to EQT's senior notes by Moody's, S P and Fitch. Prior to EQT's redemption of all of EQT's outstanding 6.125 senior notes, interest rates for EQT's 6.125 senior notes fluctuated based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to EQT's senior notes by Moody's, S P and Fitch. Interest rates for our other outstanding senior notes do not fluctuate based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to our senior notes by Moody's, S P and Fitch. For a discussion of credit rating downgrade risk, see "Risk Factors Our operations have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our debt and Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of fair value measurements, including the fair value measurement of our debt. 
 
 Other Market Risks. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value, which may change as market prices change. Our OTC derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and, thus, are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as the financial industry as a whole. We use various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate our credit risk exposures, including monitoring current market conditions and counterparty credit fundamentals. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals. To manage the level of credit risk, we enter into transactions primarily with financial counterparties that are of investment grade, enter into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security. 
 
 Approximately 54 , or 210 million, of our OTC derivative contracts outstanding at September 30, 2024 had a positive fair value. Approximately 86 , or 912 million, of our OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 had a positive fair value. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to our derivative contracts. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made no adjustments to the fair value of our derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal non-performance risk adjustment included in our established fair value procedure. We monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of our derivative contracts. 
 
 We are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil. Revenues and related accounts receivable from our operations are generated primarily from the sale of our produced natural gas, NGLs and oil to marketers, utilities and industrial customers located in the Appalachian Basin and in markets that are accessible through our transportation portfolio, which includes markets in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast United States and Canada. We also contract with certain processors to market a portion of our NGLs on our behalf. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for either EQT's revolving credit facility or the Term Loan Facility held more than 10 of the financial commitments thereunder. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for Eureka's revolving credit facility held more than 13 of the financial commitments thereunder. The large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit our exposure to disruption or consolidation in the banking industry.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. During the third quarter of 2024, we completed the Equitrans Midstream Merger and began integrating the acquired assets into our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal control over financial reporting and will continue to evaluate the operating effectiveness of related key controls. 
 
 Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against us. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. We accrue legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. We have established reserves in amounts that we believe to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of any pending matter involving us will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Environmental Proceedings 
 
 Pratt Storage Field Matter, Morgan Township, Pennsylvania . On October 31, 2018, a gas explosion occurred in Morgan Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania (the Pratt Incident). Following the explosion, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the Department of Transportation (PHMSA) began investigating the Pratt Incident. In October 2019, the PADEP notified Equitrans Midstream that it was required to submit an investigation report pursuant to the state's gas migration regulations due to the Pratt Incident's proximity to Equitrans, L.P.'s (a subsidiary of Equitrans Midstream) Pratt Storage Field assets. Equitrans Midstream, while disputing the applicability of the regulations, submitted a report to the PADEP in May 2020. In September 2020, the PADEP responded to Equitrans Midstream's investigation report with a request for additional information. Equitrans Midstream responded to the September 2020 request. Over the next several months, Equitrans Midstream provided responses to the PADEP's continuing information requests. The PADEP issued a final report and closed its investigation in August 2022, and we do not expect further inquiry from the PADEP on this matter. 
 
 On October 23, 2023, Equitrans, L.P. received permission from the FERC to plug and abandon the well in the Pratt Storage Field that was the subject of the PADEP's investigation of the Pratt Incident. On October 22, 2024, Equitrans, L.P. received from the FERC an extension until January 31, 2025 to complete plugging and abandonment of the well. Additionally, Equitrans Midstream is continuing to defend in a civil litigation related to the Pratt Incident.

Table of Contents 

On October 30, 2023, Equitrans, L.P. received a criminal complaint from the State Attorney General's Office charging Equitrans, L.P. with violations of the Clean Streams Law (the Pratt Complaint). As a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we indirectly assumed Equitrans Midstream's and Equitrans, L.P.'s defense against the Pratt Complaint and matters related to the Pratt Incident. We intend to fully assert Equitrans Midstream's and Equitrans, L.P.'s rights and defenses to the claims raised in the Pratt Complaint. The Pratt Complaint carries the possibility of a monetary sanction, that if imposed could result in a fine in excess of 300,000; however, we expect that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 Rager Mountain Storage Field Venting, Jackson Township, Pennsylvania. On November 6, 2022, Equitrans Midstream became aware of natural gas venting from one of the storage wells, well 2244, at Equitrans, L.P.'s Rager Mountain natural gas storage facility (the Rager Mountain Facility), located in Jackson Township, a remote section of Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Venting at the Rager Mountain Facility was halted on November 19, 2022. Since the time of the incident, the PADEP has concluded its investigation and PHMSA and other investigators are continuing to conduct civil and criminal investigations of the incident, and Equitrans Midstream has been cooperating in such investigations. On December 7, 2022, Equitrans Midstream and Equitrans, L.P. each separately received an order from the PADEP alleging, in connection with earth disturbance activities undertaken to halt the venting of natural gas from well 2244, (i) in the case of the order received by Equitrans Midstream, violations of Pennsylvania's Clean Streams Law and requiring certain remedial actions and (ii) in the case of the order received by Equitrans, L.P., violations of Pennsylvania's 2012 Oil and Gas Act, Clean Streams Law and Solid Waste Management Act and requiring certain remedial actions. On December 8, 2022, the PADEP submitted a compliance order to Equitrans, L.P. relating to certain alleged violations of law with respect to wells at the Rager Mountain Facility and the venting of natural gas, including from well 2244. The December 8, 2022 order also prohibited Equitrans, L.P. from injecting natural gas into the storage wells at the Rager Mountain Facility. Equitrans Midstream and Equitrans, L.P. disputed aspects of the applicable orders, and on January 5, 2023, Equitrans Midstream and Equitrans, L.P., as applicable, appealed each of the orders to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board. Equitrans, L.P. and the PADEP entered into a Stipulation of Settlement on April 12, 2023 that, among other things, resulted in the PADEP rescinding its December 8, 2022 order and Equitrans, L.P. withdrawing its appeal of such order. 
 
 On October 5, 2023, Equitrans, L.P. received a notice of violation (NOV) from the PADEP's Bureau of Air Quality Management for the release of uncontrolled hydrocarbons to the atmosphere during the Rager Mountain Facility incident. On April 8, 2024, the PADEP's Bureau of Air Quality Management executed a Consent Assessment of Civil Penalty that settled the October 5, 2023 NOV and included an agreed upon civil penalty of 350,000, which was paid in full by Equitrans Midstream on April 15, 2024. 
 
 On April 4, 2024, (i) Equitrans, L.P. and the PADEP entered into a Stipulation of Settlement, that, among other things, resulted in the PADEP deeming the December 8, 2022 orders to Equitrans Midstream and Equitrans, L.P. administratively closed and (ii) the PADEP issued a Civil Penalty Assessment (CPA) in the amount of 764,000, of which 549,500 was reimbursement of PADEP's expenses. The CPA closed the outstanding NOVs issued by the PADEP's Office of Oil and Gas Management related to the Rager Mountain Facility incident. Equitrans Midstream paid the civil penalty pursuant to the CPA in full on April 8, 2024. 
 
 On December 29, 2022, the PHMSA issued Equitrans Midstream a Notice of Proposed Safety Order that included proposed remedial requirements related to the Rager Mountain Facility incident, including, but not limited to, completing a root cause analysis, and subsequently, on May 26, 2023, the PHMSA issued a consent order to Equitrans Midstream requiring the completion of a root cause analysis and a remedial work plan and providing that Equitrans Midstream may not resume injection operations at the Rager Mountain Facility until authorized by the PHMSA. In August 2023, Equitrans Midstream submitted a root cause analysis to the PHMSA and later submitted a remedial work plan and injection plan seeking authority to resume injections at the Rager Mountain Facility using all wells in the facility except three, which remained disconnected from the storage field. On October 2, 2023, the PHMSA approved Equitrans Midstream's injection plan and Equitrans Midstream restarted injections at the Rager Mountain Facility on October 5, 2023, subject to certain pressure restrictions and other requirements in the PHMSA consent agreement. On November 16, 2023, the PHMSA issued a letter to Equitrans Midstream approving Equitrans Midstream's request to remove all pressure restrictions at the Rager Mountain Facility. On May 30, 2024, the PHMSA approved resuming operations for one of the three remaining wells excluded from the injection plan. 
 
 As a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we indirectly assumed Equitrans Midstream's and Equitrans, L.P.'s defense and responses to matters related to the Rager Mountain Facility incident. We plan to continue working with the PHMSA, pursuant to the consent order between PHSMA and Equitrans Midstream, regarding the remaining two disconnected wells at the Rager Mountain Facility. If additional penalties are pursued and ultimately imposed related to the Rager Mountain Facility incident, the penalties, individually and/or in the aggregate, may exceed 300,000; however, we expect that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There are no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 other than those listed below. 
 
 Risks Related to Gathering Segment and Transmission Segment Operations 
 
 We are subject to numerous operational risks and hazards incidental to the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas, as well as unforeseen interruptions. 
 
 Our business operations are subject to the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas. These operating risks, some of which we have experienced and/or could experience in the future, include but are not limited to: 
 
 aging infrastructure and mechanical or structural problems; 
 security risks, including cybersecurity; 
 pollution and other environmental risks; 
 operator error; 
 failure of equipment, facilities or new technology; 
 damage to pipelines, wells and storage assets, facilities, equipment, environmental controls and surrounding properties, and pipeline blockages or other operational interruptions, caused or exacerbated by natural phenomena, weather conditions, acts of sabotage, vandalism and terrorism; 
 inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, and farm and utility equipment; 
 uncontrolled releases of natural gas and other hydrocarbons or of fresh, mixed or produced water, or other hazardous materials; 
 leaks, migrations or losses of natural gas as a result of issues regarding pipeline and/or storage equipment or facilities and, including with respect to storage assets, as a result of undefined boundaries, geologic anomalies, limitations in then-applied industry-standard testing methodologies, operational practices (including as a result of regulatory requirements), natural pressure migration and wellbore migration or other factors relevant to such storage assets; 
 ruptures, fires, leaks and explosions; and 
 other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution to the environment and suspension of operations. 
 
 Any such events, certain of which we have experienced, and any of which we may experience in the future, could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment or interruption, which could be significant, to our operations, regulatory investigations and penalties or other sanctions and substantial losses to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance. The location of certain segments of our systems in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the damages resulting from these risks. Accidents or other operating risks have resulted, and in the future could result, in loss of service available to our customers. Customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our systems and/or our assets have included and/or may include, without limitation and as applicable, curtailments, limitations on our ability to satisfy customer contractual requirements, obligations to provide reservation charge credits to customers and solicitation of our existing customers by third parties for potential new projects that would compete directly with our existing services. Such circumstances could adversely impact our ability to retain customers and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Expanding our business by constructing new midstream assets subjects us to construction, business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial, environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control. 
 
 The development and construction by us or our joint ventures of pipeline and storage facilities and the optimization of such assets involve numerous construction, business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial, environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control, require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital and expose us to risks. Those risks include, but are not limited to: (i) physical construction conditions, such as topographical, or unknown or unanticipated geological, conditions and impediments; (ii) construction site access logistics; (iii) crew availability and productivity and ability to adhere to construction workforce drawdown plans; (iv) adverse weather conditions; (v) project opposition, including delays caused by landowners, advocacy groups or activists opposed to our projects and/or the natural gas industry through lawsuits or intervention in regulatory proceedings; (vi) environmental protocols and evolving regulatory or legal requirements and related impacts therefrom, including additional costs of compliance; (vii) the application of time of year or other regulatory restrictions affecting construction, (viii) failure to meet customer contractual requirements; (ix) environmental hazards; (x) vandalism; (xi) the lack of available skilled labor, equipment and materials (or escalating costs in respect thereof, including as a result of inflation); (xii) issues regarding availability of or access to connecting infrastructure; and (xiii) the inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all (and maintain such rights-of-way, approvals and permits once obtained, including by reason of judicial hostility or activism). Risks inherent in the construction of these types of projects, such as unanticipated geological conditions, challenging terrain in certain of our construction areas and severe or continuous adverse weather conditions, have adversely affected, and in the future could adversely affect, project timing, completion and cost, as well as increase the risk of loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property or environmental pollution. Most notably, certain of these risks have been realized in the construction of the MVP project, including construction-related risks and adverse weather conditions, and such risks or other risks may be realized in the future which may further adversely affect the timing and/or cost of the MVP and the MVP Southgate project. 
 
 Given such risks and uncertainties, our midstream projects or those of our joint ventures may not be completed on schedule, within budgeted cost or at all. As a further example, public participation, including by pipeline infrastructure opponents, in the review and permitting process of projects, through litigation or otherwise, has previously introduced, and in the future can introduce, uncertainty and adversely affect project timing, completion and cost. See also Item 1A., "Risk Factors The regulatory approval process for the construction of new transmission assets is very challenging, and, as demonstrated with the MVP pipeline, has resulted in significantly increased costs and delayed targeted in-service dates, and decisions by regulatory and/or judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings relevant to the development of midstream assets, particularly any litigation instituted in the Fourth Circuit, such as regarding the MVP Southgate project and/or expansions or extensions of the MVP, are likely to impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations, including as may be necessary to complete certain projects in a timely manner or at all, or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects." Further, civil protests regarding environmental justice and social issues or challenges in project permitting processes related to such issues, including proposed construction and location of infrastructure associated with fossil fuels, poses an increased risk and may lead to increased litigation, legislative and regulatory initiatives and review at federal, state, tribal and local levels of government or permitting delays that can prevent or delay the construction of such infrastructure and realization of associated revenues. 
 
 Additionally, construction expenditures on projects generally occur over an extended period, yet we will not receive revenues from, or realize any material increases in cash flow as a result of, the relevant project until it is placed into service. Moreover, our cash flow from a project may be delayed or may not meet our expectations, including as a result of taxes which could potentially be calculated based on excess expenditures, inclusive of maintenance, incurred during extended court-driven construction delays. Furthermore, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production and/or demand in a region in which such growth does not materialize or is delayed beyond our expectations. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return. Such issues in respect of the construction of midstream assets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

The regulatory approval process for the construction of new transmission assets is very challenging, and, as demonstrated with the MVP pipeline, has resulted in significantly increased costs and delayed targeted in-service dates, and decisions by regulatory and/or judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings relevant to the development of midstream assets, particularly any litigation instituted in the Fourth Circuit, such as regarding the MVP Southgate project and/or expansions or extensions of the MVP, are likely to impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations, including as may be necessary to complete certain projects in a timely manner or at all, or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects. 
 
 Certain of our projects require regulatory approval from federal, state and/or local authorities prior to and/or in the course of construction, including any extensions from, expansions of or additions to our and the MVP Joint Venture's gathering, transmission and storage systems, as applicable. The approval process for certain projects has become increasingly slower and more difficult, due in part to federal, state and local concerns related to exploration and production, transmission and gathering activities and associated environmental impacts, and the increasingly negative public perception regarding, and opposition to, the oil and gas industry, including major pipeline projects like the MVP and MVP Southgate. Further, regulatory approvals and authorizations, even when obtained, have increasingly been subject to judicial challenge by activists requesting that issued approvals and authorizations be stayed and vacated. 
 
 Accordingly, authorizations needed for our or the MVP Joint Venture's projects, including any expansion of the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project or other extensions, may not be granted or, if granted, such authorizations may include burdensome or expensive conditions or may later be stayed or revoked or vacated, as was repeatedly the case with the construction of the MVP project, particularly in respect of litigation in the Fourth Circuit. Significant delays in the regulatory approval process for projects, as well as stays and losses of critical authorizations and permits, should they be experienced, have the potential to significantly increase costs, delay targeted in-service dates and/or affect operations for projects (among other adverse effects), as has happened with the MVP and the originally contemplated MVP Southgate projects and could occur in the future in the case of authorizations required for our or the MVP Joint Venture's current or future projects, including in respect of developing expansions or extensions, such as expansion of the MVP project and the MVP Southgate project. 
 
 Any such adverse developments and uncertainties could adversely affect our ability, and/or, as applicable, the ability for the MVP Joint Venture and its owners, including us, to achieve expected investment returns, adversely affect our willingness or ability and/or that of our joint venture partners to continue to pursue projects, and/or cause impairments, including to our equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture. 
 
 We have experienced and may further experience increased opposition with respect to our and the MVP Joint Venture's projects from activists in the form of lawsuits, intervention in regulatory proceedings and otherwise, which could result in adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, opponents were successful in past challenges with respect to the MVP project and certain challenges with respect to MVP project authorizations remain outstanding. Opposition is ongoing regarding the MVP Southgate project and is expected for future projects, including any expansions of the MVP. If ongoing or future challenges are successful, it could result in significant, adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Such opposition has made it increasingly difficult to complete projects and place them in service and, following any in-service, may also affect operations or affect extensions and/or expansions of projects. Further, such opposition and/or adverse court rulings and regulatory determinations may have the effect of increasing the timeframe on necessary agency action to address actual or perceived concerns in prior adverse court rulings, or may have the effect of increasing the risk that at a future point joint venture partners may elect not to continue to pursue or fund a project, which could, absent additional project sponsors, significantly imperil the ability to complete the project. See also Item 1A., "Risk Factors We have entered into joint ventures, and may in the future enter into additional or modify existing joint ventures, that might restrict our operational and corporate flexibility and divert our management's time and our resources. In addition, we exercise no control over joint venture partners and it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures or partners to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture's best interests and these joint ventures are subject to many of the same risks to which we are subject." Challenges to our projects could adversely affect our business (including by increasing the possibility of investor activism), financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Increased competition from other companies that provide gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas, or from alternative fuel or energy sources, could negatively impact demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial results. 
 
 Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts or add new contracts at rates sufficient to maintain or grow our Gathering segment and Transmission segment revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our midstream competitors. Our midstream systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage facilities in the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and may be better positioned to compete, including if the midstream industry moves towards greater consolidation. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering systems, transmission and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, certain of our customers have developed or acquired their own gathering infrastructure, and may acquire or develop gathering, transmission or storage infrastructure in the future, which could have a negative impact on the demand for our services depending on the location of such systems relative to our assets and our producer customers' drilling plans, commodity prices, existing contracts and other factors. 
 
 The policies of the FERC promoting competition in natural gas markets continue to have the effect of increasing the natural gas transmission and storage options for our customer base. As a result, in the future we could experience "turnback" of firm capacity as existing agreements expire. If we are unable to remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted rates compared to previous contracts, we may have to bear the costs associated with the turned back capacity. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of natural gas transported or stored on our systems or, in cases where we do not have long-term firm contracts, could force us to lower our transmission or storage rates. 
 
 Further, natural gas as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including coal, liquid fuels and, increasingly, renewable and alternative energy. Increases, whether driven by legislation, regulation or consumer preferences, in the availability and demand for renewable and alternative energy at the expense of natural gas (or increases in the demand for other sources of energy relative to natural gas based on price and other factors) could adversely affect our producer customers and lead to a reduction in demand for our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services. 
 
 In addition, competition, including from renewable and alternative energy, could intensify the negative impact of factors that decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by our systems, such as adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas. 
 
 All of these competitive pressures could make it more difficult for us to retain our existing customers and/or attract new customers and/or additional volumes from existing customers as we seek to maintain and expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 We may not be able to renew or replace expiring gathering, transmission or storage contracts at favorable rates, on a long-term basis or at all, and disagreements have occurred and may arise with contractual counterparties on the interpretation of existing or future contractual terms. 
 
 One of our exposures to market risk occurs at the time our existing gathering, transmission and storage contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal. As these contracts expire, we may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing customers or enter into new contracts with existing customers or other customers. We may be unable to do so on favorable commercial terms, if at all. Further, we also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of our contract portfolio. The extension or renewal of existing contracts and entry into new contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to: (i) the level of existing and new competition to provide services to our markets; (ii) macroeconomic factors affecting natural gas economics for our current and potential customers; (iii) the balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in our markets; (iv) the extent to which the customers in our markets are willing to contract on a long-term basis or require capacity on our systems; (v) customers' existing and future downstream commitments; and (vi) the effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers and us. Additionally, disagreements may arise with contractual counterparties on the interpretation of contractual provisions, including during the negotiation, for example, of contract amendments required to be entered into upon the occurrence of specified events. 

65 

Table of Contents 

Any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts or to extend or replace our significant contracts, or extending or replacing contracts at unfavorable or lower rates or with lower or no associated firm reservation fee revenues, or other disadvantageous terms relative to the prior contract structure, or disagreements or disputes on the interpretation of existing or future contractual terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 We may not be able to increase our customer throughput and resulting revenue due to competition and other factors, which could limit our ability to grow our Gathering segment and Transmission segment. 
 
 Our ability to increase our customer-subscribed capacity and throughput and resulting revenue is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including competition from producers' existing contractual obligations to competitors, the location of our assets relative to those of competitors for existing or potential producer customers (or such producer customers' own midstream assets), takeaway capacity constraints out of the Appalachian Basin, commodity prices, producers' optionality in utilizing our (relative to third-party) systems to fill downstream commitments, and the extent to which we have available capacity when and where shippers require it. To the extent that we lack available capacity on our systems for volumes, or we cannot economically increase capacity, we may not be able to compete effectively with third-party systems for additional natural gas production in our areas of operation and capacity constraints, as well as commodity prices, may, as has occurred in the past, adversely affect the degree to which natural gas production occurs in the Appalachian Basin, and relatedly the degree to which our systems are utilized. 
 
 Our efforts to attract new customers or larger commitments from existing customers may be adversely affected by our desire to provide services pursuant to long-term firm contracts and contracts with MVCs. Our potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements which could require volumetric exposure or potentially direct commodity exposure, and we may not be willing to agree to such other forms of contractual arrangements. 
 
 If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport or process natural gas or do not accept deliveries of natural gas from us, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be adversely affected. 
 
 We depend on third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide receipt and delivery options to and from our transmission and storage systems. For example, our storage system and the MVP Joint Venture's transmission system interconnect, as applicable, with the following third-party interstate pipelines: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC, East Tennessee Natural Gas, Texas Eastern, Eastern Gas Transmission, Columbia Gas Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and ET Rover Pipeline, LLC, as well as multiple distribution companies. Similarly, our gathering systems have multiple delivery interconnects to multiple interstate pipelines. In the event that our or the MVP Joint Venture's access to such systems is impaired (or any third-party refuses to accept our or any of the MVP Joint Venture's deliveries), our or the MVP Joint Venture's operations could be adversely affected, resulting in adverse economic impact to us or the MVP Joint Venture. 
 
 Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or facilities, their continuing operation and access requirements are not within our control. If these or any other pipeline connections or facilities were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to operate efficiently and ship natural gas to end markets could be restricted, as has occurred in the past. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

A substantial majority of the services we provide on our transmission and storage system are subject to long-term, fixed-price "negotiated rate" contracts that are subject to limited or no adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, our costs could exceed our revenues received under such contracts, we could be unable to achieve the expected investment return under such contracts, and/or our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be adversely affected. 
 
 It is possible that costs to perform services under "negotiated rate" contracts could exceed the negotiated rates we have agreed to with our customers. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by our systems and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to a "negotiated rate," and that contract must be filed with and accepted by the FERC. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 97 of the contracted firm transmission capacity on our system was subscribed under such "negotiated rate" contracts. Unless the parties to these "negotiated rate" contracts agree otherwise, the contracts generally may not be adjusted to account for increased costs that could be caused by inflation, greenhouse gas emission cost (such as carbon taxes, fees, or assessments) or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services. 
 
 We have entered into joint ventures, and may in the future enter into additional or modify existing joint ventures, that might restrict our operational and corporate flexibility and divert our management's time and our resources. In addition, we exercise no control over joint venture partners and it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures or partners to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture's best interests and these joint ventures are subject to many of the same risks to which we are subject. 
 
 We have entered into several joint ventures primarily pertaining to the construction and operation of certain midstream infrastructure, including the MVP Joint Venture and Eureka Midstream Holdings, and may in the future enter into additional joint venture arrangements with third parties, including in respect of any expansion of the MVP. Joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility. Joint venture arrangements and dynamics can also divert management and operating resources in a manner that is disproportionate to our ownership percentage in such ventures. Because we do not control all of the decisions of our joint ventures or joint venture partners, it may be difficult or impossible for us to cause these joint ventures or partners to take actions that we believe would be in our or the joint venture's best interests. Moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing that we fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which we may not control, and our joint venture partners may not act in a manner that we believe would be in our or the joint venture's best interests, may elect not to support further pursuit of projects, and/or may not satisfy their financial obligations to the joint venture. The loss of joint venture partner support in further pursuing or funding a project may, and would in the case of the MVP project, significantly adversely affect the ability to complete the project. In addition, such joint ventures are subject to many of the same risks to which we are subject. 
 
 Significant portions of our assets have been in service for several decades. There could be unknown events or conditions, or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime, associated with our assets that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 Significant portions of our transmission and storage system have been in service for several decades. The age and condition of these systems has contributed to, and could result in, adverse events, or increased maintenance or repair expenditures, and downtime associated with increased maintenance and repair activities, as applicable. Any such adverse events or any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or downtime, or related loss of revenue, due to the age or condition of our systems could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See also Item 1A., " Risk Factors We and our joint ventures may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of performance of our pipeline and storage integrity management programs and compliance with increasingly stringent safety regulation."

We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations and future development. 
 
 We do not own all of the land on which our pipelines, storage systems and facilities have been constructed, and we have been, and in the future could be, subject to more onerous terms, and/or increased costs or delays, in attempting (or by virtue of the need to attempt) to acquire or to maintain use rights to land. Although many of these rights are perpetual in nature, we occasionally obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and other facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time or in a manner in which certain facts could give rise to the presumption of the abandonment of the pipeline or other facilities. As has been the case in the past, if we were to be unsuccessful in negotiating or renegotiating rights-of-way or easements, we might have to institute condemnation proceedings on our FERC-regulated assets, the potential for which may have a negative effect on the timing and/or terms of FERC action on a project's certification application and/or the timing of any authorized activities, or relocate our facilities for non-regulated assets. The FERC has announced a policy that would presumptively stay the effectiveness of certain future construction certificates, which may limit when we are able to exercise condemnation authority. It is possible that the U.S. Congress may amend Section 7 of the NGA to codify the FERC's presumptive stay or otherwise limit, modify, or remove the ability to utilize condemnation. It is also possible that a court may limit, modify or remove an operator's ability to utilize condemnation under Section 7 of the NGA. A loss of rights-of-way, lease or easements or a relocation of our non-regulated assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. Additionally, even when we own an interest in the land on which our pipelines, storage systems and facilities have been constructed, agreements with correlative rights owners have caused us to, and in the future may require that we, relocate pipelines and facilities or shut in storage systems and facilities to facilitate the development of the correlative rights owners' estate, or pay the correlative rights owners the lost value of their estate if they are not willing to accommodate development. 
 
 Our and the MVP Joint Venture's natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services, as applicable, are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes in or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities, and related litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 Our and the MVP Joint Venture's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations, as applicable, are regulated by the FERC under the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) and the regulations, rules and policies promulgated under those and other statutes. Our and the MVP Joint Venture's FERC-regulated operations are pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC that establish rates (other than market-based rate authority), cost recovery mechanisms and terms and conditions of service to our customers. The FERC's authority extends to a variety of matters relevant to our operations. 
 
 Pursuant to the NGA, existing interstate transmission and storage rates, terms and conditions of service, and contracts may be challenged by complaint and are subject to prospective change by the FERC. Additionally, rate increases, changes to terms and conditions of service and contracts proposed by a regulated interstate pipeline may be protested and such actions can be delayed and may ultimately be rejected by the FERC. As of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we and the MVP Joint Venture currently hold authority from the FERC to charge and collect (i) "recourse rates," which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff, (ii) "discount rates," which are rates below the "recourse rates" and above a minimum level, (iii) "negotiated rates," which involve rates that may be above or below the "recourse rates," provided that the affected customers are willing to agree to such rates and that the FERC has approved the negotiated rate agreement, and (iv) market-based rates for some of our storage services from which we derive a small portion of our revenues. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 97 of our contracted firm transmission capacity was subscribed to by customers under negotiated rate agreements under our tariff, rather than recourse, discount or market-based rate contracts. There can be no guarantee that we or the MVP Joint Venture will be allowed to continue to operate under such rates or rate structures for the remainder of those assets' operating lives. Customers, the FERC or other interested stakeholders, such as state regulatory agencies, may challenge our or the MVP Joint Venture's rates offered to customers or the terms and conditions of service included in our tariffs. Neither we nor the MVP Joint Venture have an agreement in place that would prohibit customers from challenging our or the MVP Joint Venture's rates or tariffs. Any successful challenge against rates charged for our or the MVP Joint Venture's transmission and storage services, as applicable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.

Any changes to the FERC's policies regarding the natural gas industry may have an impact on us, including the FERC's approach to pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as interstate pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transmission capacity and transmission and storage facilities. The FERC and U.S. Congress may continue to evaluate changes in the NGA or new or modified FERC regulations or policies that may impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's operations and affect our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to construct new facilities and the timing and cost of such new facilities, as well as the rates charged to our or the MVP Joint Venture's customers and the services provided. 
 
 Our and the MVP Joint Venture's significant construction projects generally require review by multiple governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any agency's delay in the issuance of, or refusal to issue, authorizations or permits, issuance of such authorizations or permits with unanticipated conditions, or the loss of a previously-issued authorization or permit, for one or more of these projects may mean that we will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that we did not anticipate (as has been the case with our MVP project). Such delays, refusals, losses of permits, or resulting modifications to projects, certain of which we have experienced with respect to the MVP project and the originally contemplated MVP Southgate project, could materially and negatively impact the revenues and costs expected from these projects or cause us or our joint venture partners to abandon planned projects. 
 
 Failure to comply with applicable provisions of the NGA, the NGPA, federal pipeline safety laws and certain other laws, as well as with the regulations, rules, orders, restrictions and conditions associated with these laws, could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties. For example, the FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of up to approximately 1.5 million (adjusted periodically for inflation) per violation, per day for violations of the NGA, the NGPA or the rules, regulations, restrictions, conditions and orders promulgated under those statutes. 
 
 In addition, future federal, state or local legislation or regulations under which we or the MVP Joint Venture will operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 We and our joint ventures may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of performance of our pipeline and storage integrity management programs and compliance with increasingly stringent safety regulation. 
 
 The U.S. Department of Transportation, acting through PHMSA, and certain state agencies certificated by PHMSA, have adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could impact high population sensitive areas (also known as High Consequence Areas) and newly defined Moderate Consequence Areas, and an integrity management program for storage wells, unless the operator effectively demonstrates by a prescriptive risk assessment that these operational assets have mitigated risks that could affect these predefined areas, as applicable. The regulations require operators, including us, to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline and storage integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments and storage wells that could impact population sensitive areas; confirm maximum allowable operating pressures; maintain and improve processes for data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate facilities as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigating actions. In addition to population sensitive areas, PHMSA has recently adopted regulations extending existing design, operation and maintenance, and reporting requirements to onshore gathering pipelines in rural areas. Finally, new PHMSA regulations require operators of certain transmission pipelines to assess their integrity management and maintenance practices, comply with enhanced corrosion control and mitigation timelines, and follow new requirements for pipeline inspections following an extreme weather event or natural disaster. 
 
 The cost and financial impact of compliance will vary and depend on factors such as the number and extent of maintenance determined to be necessary as a result of the application of our integrity management programs, and such costs and financial impact could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, our pipeline and storage integrity management programs depend in part on inspection tools and methodologies developed, maintained, enhanced and applied, and certain testing conducted, by certain third parties, many of which are widely utilized within the natural gas industry. Advances in these tools and methodologies could identify potential and/or additional integrity issues for our assets. Consequently, we may incur additional costs and expenses to remediate those newly identified or potential issues, and we may not have the ability to timely comply with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, pipeline and storage safety laws and regulations are subject to change and failures to comply with pipeline and storage safety laws and regulations, including changes in such laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that result in more stringent or costly safety standards, could have a material adverse effect on us.

We may, and joint ventures of which we are the operator could, as is the case with the MVP Joint Venture, become subject to consent orders and agreements relating to integrity matters. Failure to comply with any such consent order or agreements could have adverse effects on our business. 
 
 Risks Related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger 
 
 We incurred significant indebtedness as a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, and any future indebtedness, as well as the restrictions under our and our subsidiaries' debt agreements, could adversely affect our operating flexibility, business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
 
 As a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we incurred additional indebtedness under EQT's revolving credit facility, and the outstanding debt under Eureka's revolving credit facility and the outstanding senior notes issued by EQM were consolidated by the Company. See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and the outstanding senior notes issued by EQM. Eureka's revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit Eureka's ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt, make distributions on or redeem or repurchase membership units, incur or permit liens on assets, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, enter into burdensome agreements, subject to certain specified exceptions, enter into certain mergers or acquisitions; and, dispose of all or substantially all of their respective assets. 
 
 Additionally, under Eureka's revolving credit facility, Eureka is required to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement) of not more than 4.75 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.25 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). As of the end of any fiscal quarter, Eureka may not permit the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement) for the four fiscal quarters then ending to Consolidated Interest Charges (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement) to be less than 2.50 to 1.00. Eureka's revolving credit facility also contains certain events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement). Events beyond the control of Eureka (including changes in general economic and business conditions) may affect the ability of Eureka to meet and comply with their respective financial obligations and covenants. 
 
 The provisions of our and our subsidiaries' debt agreements may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of these debt agreements could result in an event of default, which could enable creditors to, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement, declare any outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of the debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and in turn our shareholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investments. EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility, the Term Loan Facility and certain of EQT's and EQM's senior notes each contain a cross default provision that applies to a default related to any other indebtedness the applicable borrower may have with an aggregate principal amount in excess of a specified threshold as set forth in the applicable debt documents. 
 
 Our and our subsidiaries' levels of debt could have important consequences to us, including that our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms; our funds available for operations, future business opportunities and dividends to our shareholders may be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our or our subsidiaries' debt; we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited. 
 
 Our ability to service our and our subsidiaries' current, or our or our subsidiaries' future respective debts, will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Further, we view de-levering our business as a critical strategic objective given that leverage levels affect the manner in which we may pursue strategic and organic initiatives, our ability to respond to market and competitive pressures, and the competition for investment capital. Our ability to de-lever and the pace thereof will depend on our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, as well as the MVP Joint Venture's ability to execute on project-level financing, some of which are beyond our control.

Table of Contents 

If our operating results are not sufficient to service our and our subsidiaries' current, or our or our subsidiaries' future indebtedness, as applicable, or our operating results affect our ability to comply with covenants in our debt agreements, we may be forced to take actions such as seeking modifications to the terms of our debt agreements, including providing guarantees, pledging assets as collateral, reducing dividends, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity or debt capital. We may not be able to timely effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, if our operating results are not sufficient to enable de-levering or affect the pace of de-levering, or if MVP project-level financing is not realized, the manner in which we may pursue strategic and organic initiatives, address market and competitive pressures, and compete for investment capital may be adversely affected, absent additional actions to de-lever, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all. 
 
 Our and our subsidiaries' current indebtedness and the additional debt we and/or our subsidiaries will incur in the future for, among other things, working capital, repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, capital contributions to joint ventures, including the MVP Joint Venture, acquisitions or operating activities may adversely affect our liquidity and therefore our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. 
 
 In addition, our and our subsidiaries' level of indebtedness may be viewed negatively by credit rating agencies, our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings may be lowered, we may reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or investments, and we may revise our shareholder returns strategy or other strategic plans. Changes in our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings may affect our access to the capital markets, the cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under our lines of credit, the interest rate on EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility, the Term Loan Facility and EQT's senior notes with adjustable rates, the rates available on new long-term debt, our pool of investors and funding sources, the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on our OTC derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements, including collateral, in support of our midstream service contracts, joint venture arrangements or construction contracts. 
 
 We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, and the Equitrans Midstream Merger may disrupt our current plans or operations. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate Equitrans Midstream and the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. If the combined company is not able to realize the anticipated benefits expected from the transaction within the anticipated timing or at all, the combined company's business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected, the combined company's earnings per share may be diluted, the accretive effect of the Equitrans Midstream Merger may decrease or be delayed and the share price of the combined company may be negatively impacted. The integration of the two companies has required and will continue to require significant time and focus from management and could result in performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention to such integration efforts. Difficulties in integrating Equitrans Midstream into our company may result in the combined company performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated synergies on the anticipated timeline. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others, complexities associated with managing a larger, more complex, integrated business; potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with Equitrans Midstream; and inconsistencies between the two company's standards, controls, procedures and policies. In addition, our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations. 
 
 We are expected to continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Equitrans Midstream Merger, which may be in excess of those anticipated by us. 
 
 We have incurred and are expected to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Equitrans Midstream Merger, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 274.6 million and 298.7 million, respectively, of transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Of this amount, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized severance and other termination benefits and stock-based compensation costs of 161.0 million.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 We did not repurchase any equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 On December 13, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program) authorizing us to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to 1 billion, excluding fees, commissions and expenses. On September 6, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 1 billion increase to the Share Repurchase Program, pursuant to which approval we are authorized to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to 2 billion, excluding fees, commissions and expenses. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in amounts and at prices we deem appropriate and will be subject to a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. The Share Repurchase Program was originally scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023; however, on April 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a one-year extension of the Share Repurchase Program. As a result of such extension, the Share Repurchase Program will expire on December 31, 2024, but it may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. As of September 30, 2024, we had purchased shares for an aggregate purchase price of 622.1 million, excluding fees, commissions and expenses, under the Share Repurchase Program since its inception, and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the Share Repurchase Program is 1.4 billion. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or "officers" (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) or a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" (as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, this Paragraph 2(c) shall not impact Employee s currently held equity compensation awards, Key Talent Award, and or Transaction Retention Award (each, as applicable), any vested or accrued benefits pursuant to any applicable plan, agreement, or arrangement of ETRN or EQT, and each of their parents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, affiliates, predecessors and successors (collectively, the EQT Companies ), any right to indemnification, advancement of legal fees or directors and officers liability insurance coverage existing under the constituent documents of the EQT Companies (as in effect from time to time), and Employee s right to elect certain continued medical coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 COBRA or the right to convert certain insurance coverage to a personal plan, as applicable, and reimbursements for legitimate business expenses owed to Employee by the EQT Companies pursuant to the expense reimbursement policies of the EQT Companies provided , that Employee submits such expenses for reimbursement no later than 30 days following the Date of Termination, which, in each case, shall remain 
 2 

subject to the terms and conditions governing those awards or rights and any applicable terms of the Merger Agreement. 
 (d) EQT will not contest a claim filed by Employee for unemployment compensation benefits. However, Employee understands that eligibility for unemployment compensation is determined by the applicable state, not by EQT. 
 (e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the payments and other covenants described herein constitute fair and adequate consideration for (i) Employee s agreement to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential (ii) Employee s release of all claims and causes of action against the Releasees (as defined below) and (iii) all other covenants and commitments mentioned in this Agreement. 
 (f) To the extent the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act WARN Act ), or other applicable law, may have otherwise required the Company to provide notice to Employee related to a plant closure or layoff, the parties hereby agree that the payments made to Employee described in Paragraph 2(a) above shall offset, and be in lieu of, any required notice and or any corresponding payments to Employee. 
 3. In consideration for the promises of the Company set forth in this Agreement, Employee and his her agents, attorneys, heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and assigns hereby voluntarily, irrevocably and unconditionally release and forever discharge EQT, each of its subsidiaries, predecessors and successors in interest, and other affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, including ETRN and its subsidiaries, predecessors, successors in interest, and other affiliates), and each of the foregoing entities respective past, present and future officers, directors, managers, members, agents, representatives, employees and shareholders, as well as the heirs, successors or assigns of any of such persons or entities (severally and collectively called Releasees ), jointly and individually, from any and all claims, demands, issues, or causes of action, including any and all claims, demands, issues, or causes of action arising out of, or in any way related to Employee s employment with Releasees and or his her separation from employment with Releasees, whether asserted by him her or on his her behalf by any person or entity and whether known or unknown, and arising on or before the date Employee signs this Agreement. This release includes, but is not limited to, claims for back pay, front pay, emotional distress, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive damages, fringe benefits, reinstatement, attorneys fees, interest, costs and or remedies or relief of any sort whatsoever under any possible legal, equitable, tort, contract or statutory theory, including, but not limited to, any claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, sections 1981 through 1988 of Title 42 of the United States Code, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 , the Immigration Reform Control Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act , the Family Medical Leave Act, the WARN Act, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act, the Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Act, the Pennsylvania Whistleblower Law, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions, and any other federal, state and local statutes, ordinances, executive orders or regulations, under theories of unjust dismissal or wrongful discharge, breach of contract or fiduciary duty, or based on any intentional or negligent tort which Employee has, had or may have, whether known or unknown and of whatever kind or nature against Releasees, which arose on or before the date Employee signs this Agreement. Employee also hereby releases all Releasees from any and all claims for (i) the fees, costs, expenses and 
 3 

interest of any and all attorneys who now represent or who have at any time represented Employee in connection with this Agreement and or in connection with any of the matters released in this Agreement and (ii) wages, payments, benefits, attorneys fees, interest, costs and or remedies or relief of any kind whatsoever arising under the WARN Act and or any other laws requiring notice of plant closure or layoff. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement, any references to statutes include any applicable amendments thereto. 
 The release in the preceding paragraph is intended to be a general release, excluding only claims which Employee is legally barred from releasing. Employee understands, and EQT expressly acknowledges, that the release does not include any claims that cannot be released or waived as a matter of law any claim for or right to vested or accrued benefits under any EQT Companies plans, agreements, or arrangements claims for breach of this Agreement or any right to enforce this Agreement and any claims based on acts or events occurring after Employee signs this Agreement. The release also shall not affect (i) Employee s equity compensation awards, Key Talent Award, and or Transaction Retention Award, (ii) any right to indemnification, advancement of legal fees or directors and officers liability insurance coverage existing under the constituent documents of the EQT Companies (as in effect from time to time), (iii) Employee s right to elect certain continued medical coverage under COBRA or the right to convert certain insurance coverage to a personal plan, as applicable, and (iv) reimbursements for legitimate business expenses owed to Employee by the EQT Companies pursuant to the expense reimbursement of the EQT Companies provided , that Employee submits such expenses for reimbursement no later than thirty (30) days following the Date of Termination. Nothing in this Agreement prevents a challenge to the validity of the Agreement or prohibits the filing of a charge or complaint with, or testimony, assistance or participation in or cooperation with, any investigation, proceeding or hearing conducted by any federal, state or local governmental agency, including but not limited to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. However, Employee explicitly waives any right to receive monetary damages in any agency action against any Releasees. 
 4. Employee warrants that he she has no actions or claims now pending against any of the Releasees in any court of the United States or any State thereof based upon any acts or events arising out of or related to his her employment with Releasees or his her separation from employment with Releasees. Notwithstanding any other language in this Agreement, the parties understand that this Agreement does not prohibit Employee from filing an administrative charge of alleged employment discrimination or unlawful practices with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board or other governmental agency or commission. Employee, however, waives his her right to monetary or other recovery should any federal, state or local administrative agency pursue any claims on his her behalf arising out of or relating to his her employment with and or separation from employment with any of the Releasees. This means that by signing this Agreement, Employee will have waived any right he she had to obtain a recovery if an administrative agency pursues a claim against any of the Releasees based on any actions taken by any of the Releasees up to the date of the signing of this Agreement, and that Employee will have released the Releasees of any and all claims of any nature arising up to the date of the signing of this Agreement. However, nothing in this Agreement prevents Employee from (i) making any reports to or seeking or receiving any awards based upon Employee s reporting of violations of laws or regulations containing whistleblower provisions or (ii) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding with, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, and or pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
 4 

5. By entering into this Agreement, EQT in no way thereby admits that it or any of the Releasees has treated Employee unlawfully or wrongfully in any way. Neither this Agreement nor the implementation thereof shall be construed to be, or shall be admissible in any proceedings as, evidence of any admission by EQT or any of the Releasees of any violation of or failure to comply with any federal, state, or local law, ordinance, agreement, rule, regulation or order. 
 6. Employee, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, agrees to cooperate with the Company in the prosecution of or defense of litigation and in investigations of any claims or actions now in existence or that may be threatened or brought in the future relating to events or occurrences that transpired while Employee was employed by the Company or any of the Releasees (for the avoidance of doubt, including while Employee was employed by ETRN). Employee shall not testify for, cooperate with, encourage, or counsel non-governmental attorneys or their clients in the investigation, pursuit or defense of any disputes, claims, lawsuits, arbitrations, charges or complaints by any non-governmental third party against any of the Releasees, unless compelled to do so by order or subpoena issued by a court or governmental agency holding jurisdiction over Employee, and in such case only after first notifying the Company in writing within three days after receipt of such subpoena or court order. Employee further agrees to cooperate with Company in opposing the issuance and enforcement of such subpoena or court order. Employee further agrees to notify the Company in writing and within three days after receipt in the event of any requests for information, documents or testimony that Employee receives in connection with any of the foregoing. Employee acknowledges his her continuing obligations under EQT s policies to preserve EQT s, and all Releasees, confidential information and that he she has returned all EQT property in his her possession, including EQT confidential information (which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, any confidential information of ETRN). Further, the parties agree that, with respect to breaches of Paragraph 6, monetary compensation is not sufficient and EQT shall be entitled to (without posting any bond or deposit) specific performance and or other injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce or prevent any violations of such obligations. The EQT Companies will promptly advance or reimburse any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Employee as a result of Employee s obligations under this Paragraph, and to the extent that Employee s cooperation under this Paragraph exceeds four (4) hours in any month, the EQT Companies shall promptly compensate Employee at the rate of 250 per hour for each hour, or portion thereof, in excess of four (4) hours in a month. Nothing in this Paragraph is intended to alter or shall alter the Company s obligations to provide insurance coverage and indemnification with respect to the Employee pursuant to Section 5.11 of the Merger Agreement. 
 7. Employee agrees that, except as required by law and as permitted by this Paragraph and Paragraph 4, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be kept strictly confidential and will not be discussed, disclosed, or revealed, directly or indirectly, to any person, corporation, or other entity, other than to Employee s spouse, attorney, accountant for use on tax matters or to government taxing agencies or taxing officials. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Employee from (i) reporting possible violations of federal, state, or local law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal, state, or local law or regulation or (ii) disclosing confidential information and or trade secrets when this disclosure is solely for the purpose of (a) reporting possible violations of federal, state, or local law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity (b) working with legal counsel in order to determine whether possible violations of federal, state, or local law or regulation exist or (c) filing a complaint or other document in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Any disclosures of trade secrets must comply with the restrictions in the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 DTSA ). The DTSA provides that no individual will be held criminally or 
 5 

civilly liable under Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or, is made in a complaint or other document if such filing is under seal so that it is not made public. Also, an individual who pursues a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of the law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and does not disclose the trade secret, except as permitted by court order. 
 8. Employee also agrees (unless otherwise required by law or legal process or as permitted by Paragraphs 4 and 7 of this Agreement) not to make any defamatory, maliciously untrue, or disparaging remarks, comments or statements, verbally or in writing, regarding any Releasee, their respective businesses, products or services or their respective directors, officers or persons known by Employee to be employees of the Releasees in their capacity as employees. EQT agrees to instruct its named executive officers (as disclosed in EQT s most recent annual proxy statement and who are currently employed by EQT) and current members of its Board of Directors not to make any defamatory, maliciously untrue, or disparaging remarks, comments, or statements about Employee. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Employee from engaging in concerted activity protected under the National Labor Relations Act (to the extent applicable), including relative to the terms and conditions of Employee s employment, Employee s ability to file unfair labor practice charges or assist others in doing so, and cooperating in any investigative process with the National Labor Relations Board. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Employee from discussing or disclosing information about unlawful acts in the workplace, such as harassment or discrimination or any other conduct that Employee has reason to believe is unlawful. 
 9. In the event that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) (this term includes any related agency representing Medicare s interests) determines that Medicare has an interest in the payment to Employee under this Agreement, Employee agrees to (i) indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless from any action by CMS relating to medical expenses of Employee, including full satisfaction by Employee of any lien(s) asserted by CMS (ii) reasonably cooperate with the Company upon request with respect to any information needed to satisfy the reporting requirements under Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007, if applicable, including completion of the Medicare Information Authorization Form (Attachment A to this Agreement) and (iii) waive any and all future actions against the Company for any private cause of action for damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(3)(A). 
 10. Employee acknowledges that this Agreement includes a release and waiver of any and all claims of age discrimination Employee may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (collectively, ADEA arising prior to the date of this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that he she has been given forty-five (45) calendar days from the day Employee received this Agreement to review and consider this Agreement before executing it, and that he she is hereby advised in writing to consult with an attorney before executing it. Employee further acknowledges that he she has had a full and fair opportunity to consult with an attorney, that he she has carefully read and fully understands all of the provisions of this Agreement, that he she has discussed this Agreement with such attorneys if he she has chosen to, and that he she is voluntarily executing and entering into this Agreement, intending to be legally bound hereby. Employee has carefully read and fully understands the attached Exhibit A, which reflects the job titles and ages of employees in the decisional unit selected and not selected for termination of employment at this time, in accordance with the Older Workers 
 6 

Benefit Protection Act. If Employee signs this Agreement in less than forty-five (45) calendar days, Employee acknowledges that he she has thereby knowingly and voluntarily waived his her right to the full forty-five (45) calendar day period. Employee acknowledges and agrees that any changes made since Employee s receipt of this Agreement are not material and or were made at Employee s request and shall not restart the forty-five (45) day review period. 
 11. Employee and the Company agree that, for a period of seven (7) calendar days following the execution of this Agreement, Employee may revoke those provisions of this Agreement releasing and waiving Employee s rights and claims under the ADEA, and those provisions shall not become effective or enforceable until the revocation period has expired without Employee exercising the right to revoke. If Employee wishes to revoke, he she must do so by delivery of a written notice to the office of the General Counsel, EQT Corporation, 625 Liberty Avenue, Suite 1700, Pittsburgh, PA, 15222 , by no later than 5 00 p.m. on the seventh calendar day following Employee s execution of this agreement. All other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding and enforceable immediately upon Employee s execution of this Agreement, and shall remain effective regardless of whether Employee revokes Employee s waiver and release of ADEA rights and claims. 
 12. This Agreement shall, upon execution by Employee, immediately become effective and enforceable, except for the waiver of ADEA claims which shall not become effective or enforceable until the expiration without exercise of the seven (7) day revocation period described in Paragraph 11 above ADEA Effective Date ). 
 13. If Employee has materially or willfully breached this Agreement or revokes his her execution of this Agreement, EQT, in addition to any other remedies it may have (whether under applicable law or otherwise), shall be entitled to (i) suspend payment of the payments contemplated by Paragraph 2 of this Agreement to the extent not previously paid or provided and (ii) the prompt return by Employee of any portion of such payments previously paid or provided pending a court or arbitrator determination of whether such breach has occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of either party s actual or threatened breach of any condition set forth in this Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief (including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions), without posting a bond, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Employee understands that by entering into this Agreement he she will be limiting the availability of certain remedies that he she may have against the Releasees and limiting also his her ability to pursue certain claims against the Releasees. 
 14. This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the Treasury regulations thereunder Section 409A or an exemption thereunder and shall be construed and administered to the fullest extent allowed to avoid any additional tax under Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, payments provided under this Agreement may only be made upon an event and in a manner that complies with Section 409A or an applicable exemption. Any payments under this Agreement that may be excluded from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service or as a short-term deferral shall be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if on the Date of Termination, Employee is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A, and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A (e.g., because they do not satisfy the short-term deferral exception and or the 
 7 

separation pay exception), then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to Employee) until the first business day to occur following the date that is six (6) months following the Date of Termination (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A), which initial payment will include the payments and benefits that would have been paid to Employee during such six (6) month period but for the delay required by Section 409A and (ii) if any other payments of money or other benefits due to Employee hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, such payments or other benefits shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A, or otherwise such payment or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax. The Company shall consult with Employee in good faith regarding the implementation of the preceding sentence. For purposes of Section 409A, each installment payment provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. Any payments to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a separation from service under Section 409A. If any payment subject to Section 409A is contingent on the delivery of a release by Employee and could occur in either of two (2) years, the payment will occur in the later year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by Employee on account of non-compliance with Section 409A. 
 15. This Agreement may not be changed, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by both parties. 
 16. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. 
 17. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and fully supersedes any and all prior agreements or understandings between the parties relating to the same. Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee shall continue to remain bound by, and hereby reaffirms, any and all obligations and restrictive covenants, including all cooperation, confidentiality, intellectual property, noncompetition, nonsolicitation, and nondisparagement obligations that Employee owes to the Company or the other Releasees including, for the avoidance of doubt, obligations Employee owes as provided in this Agreement. Employee specifically acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding any discussions or negotiations Employee may have had with any of the Releasees prior to the execution of this Agreement, Employee is not relying on any promises or assurances other than those explicitly contained in this Agreement. 
 18. Each of the Releasees shall be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and entitled to enforce it in accordance with its terms. PDF or other electronic copies of this Agreement shall have the same force and effect as the original. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and each shall be considered to be an original and all of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. 
 8 

19. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles. The Company and Employee expressly consent to the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania s state and or federal courts and agree such courts are the proper venue for any dispute over this Agreement. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT THEY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL SUCH CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION SHALL BE DETERMINED BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. 
 20. The provisions of this Agreement are severable. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable in any court of law, the parties intend that such provision be construed by such court in a manner to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
