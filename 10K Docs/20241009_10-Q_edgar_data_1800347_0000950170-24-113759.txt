Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and are subject to the safe harbor created under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and generally can be identified by the use of words such as "may," "can," "should," "will," "estimate," "plan," "project," "forecast," "intend," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "seek," "target" and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, forward-looking statements contained in this document include our expectations regarding our future growth, operational and financial performance and business prospects and opportunities. 
 These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report and management's current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside E2open Parent Holdings, Inc.'s (we, our, us, Company, E2open) control and outside the control of our directors, officers and affiliates. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that any expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished. Investors therefore should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. 
 As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: 
 the effect of the volatile, negative or uncertain macro-economic and political conditions, inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the potential effects of these factors on our business, our slowing growth rate, results of operations and financial condition as well as our clients' businesses and levels of business activity; 

changes in market interest rates particularly on our variable rate debt, including the recent significant increases in market interest rates experienced in fiscal 2023 and 2024; 

the inability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, which could result in the incurrence of material charges related to the impairment of those assets; 

the inability to develop and market new product innovations and monetize our network; 

the slowing of our growth rate due to lower than anticipated new bookings and higher than expected churn; 

risks associated with our past acquisitions (including the BluJay and Logistyx acquisitions), including the failure to successfully integrate operations, personnel, systems and products of the acquired companies, adverse tax consequences of acquisitions, greater than expected liabilities of the acquired companies, charges to earnings from acquisitions, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage profitability, maintain relationships with clients and suppliers and retain its management and key employees and the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition; 

the inability to develop and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting; 

the inability to attract new clients or upsell/cross sell existing clients or the failure to renew existing client subscriptions on terms favorable to us; 

risks associated with our extensive and expanding international operations, including the risks created by geopolitical instability; 

the failure of the market for cloud-based SCM solutions to develop as quickly as we expect or failure to compete successfully in a fragmented and competitive SCM market; 

the diversion of management's attention and consumption of resources as a result of the strategic alternatives process; 

the inability to adequately protect key intellectual property rights or proprietary technology; 

failure to maintain adequate operational and financial resources or raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows; 

cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities; 

inability to retain key employees; and 

certain other factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

More information on factors that could cause our actual results or events to differ from those expresses in forward-looking statements in included from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC including in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024 (2024 Form 10-K).

reporting unit, any goodwill impairment assessment is performed at the Company level. During the first and third quarters of fiscal 2024, the market price of our Class A Common Stock and market capitalization declined significantly. We also experienced slowing growth and lowered projections for net sales and net operating margins due to lower than anticipated new bookings, lower revenue from tiered contracts, higher than expected churn and macroeconomic impacts primarily in the technology, freight and transportation sectors. These factors resulted in us determining that triggering events occurred, and goodwill impairment assessments were performed. The fair value of E2open was calculated using an equally weighted combination of three different methods: discounted cash flow method, guideline public company method and guideline transaction method. The discounted cash flow method was based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which were based on management's estimates of projected net sales, net operating income margins and terminal growth rates, taking into consideration market and industry conditions. The discount rate used was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the risk, size premium and business-specific characteristics related to projected cash flows. Under the guideline public company method, the fair value was based on our current and forward-looking earnings multiples using management's estimates of projected net sales and adjusted EBITDA margins with consideration of market premiums. The unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value included projected net sales, forecasted adjusted EBITDA margins, weighted average cost of capital, normalized working capital levels, capital expenditures assumptions, profitability projections, determination of appropriate market comparison companies and terminal growth rates. Under the guideline transaction method, the fair value was based on pricing multiples derived from recently sold companies with similar characteristics to E2open taking into consideration management's estimate of projected net sales and net operating income margins. The three approaches generated similar results and indicated that the fair value of E2open's equity and goodwill was less than its carrying amounts. Therefore, during the fiscal year ended February 29, 2024, we recognized impairment charges of million. As part of these impairments, we recognized an impairment charge o f mill ion during the six months ended August 31, 2023 . We did t recognize an impairment charge d uring the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 or the three months ended August 31, 2023.

and an imputed interest rate of based on our cost of debt plus an incremental premium at the closing of the Business Combination. Changes in any of these or other factors are expected to impact the timing and amount of gross payments. The fair value of these obligations w ill be accreted to the amount of the gross expected obligation. In addition, if E2open Holdings were to exercise its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, E2open Holdings will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments would be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments would be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that E2open Holdings has sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that E2open Holdings will be required to make will generally reduce the amount of the overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available, but we expect the cash tax savings it will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments.

() 

End of period 

The change in the fair value of the warrant liability is recorded in gain from change in fair value of warrant liability in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair values of our Level 1 financial instruments, which are traded in active markets, are based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair values of our Level 2 financial instruments are based on daily market foreign currency rates, interest rate curves and quoted market prices for comparable instruments or model-driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our contingent consideration is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used in preparing this model include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. This valuation model uses unobservable market input, and therefore the liability is classified as Level 3. Our public warrants are valued using active market quoted prices, which are Level 1 inputs. The private placement warrants are valued using a binomial pricing model when the warrants are subject to the make-whole table, or otherwise are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The redeemable warrants purchased pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement are valued utilizing observable market prices for public shares and warrants, relative to the present value of contractual cash proceeds. The assumptions used in preparing these models include estimates such as volatility, contractual terms, discount rates, dividend yield, expiration dates and risk-free interest rates. These valuation models use unobservable market input, and therefore the liability is classified as both Level 1 and Level 3. There were transfers of financial instruments between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 .

If there is a change in control, the award will immediately vest under the performance condition based upon the appropriate stock hurdle and automatically time-vest. The vested RSU will be paid in the form of cash and/or equity in a ratio substantially similar to the ratio received by the other shareholders in connection with the change in control. Additionally, the cash portion of the award will be equal to at least . As this award has a redemption feature for the change in control and cash value component, it is recorded as redeemable share-based awards on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As this award has a redemption feature for the change in control and cash value component, it is recorded as redeemable share-based awards on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount presented in the mezzanine as redeemable share-based awards will be the redemption amount as of the grant date, multiplied by the portion of the requisite service period that has elapsed. The redemption amount is based on the number of shares that would vest if a change in control occurred at the grant date multiplied by the grant date stock price. Once the RSUs have vested, the associated redemption value will be reclassified from the redeemable share-based award to additional paid-in capital on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted Stock Awards The restricted stock awards (RSAs) are time-based and granted to participants with the associated Class A Common Stock issued on the day of grant. The Class A Common Stock is issued subject to various restrictions, but carries voting rights.

Overview 
 We are a world class end-to-end supply chain software platform that enables the world's largest companies to transform the way they make, move and sell goods and services. Our SaaS platform spans many key strategic and operational areas including channel, planning, global trade, logistics and supply. With the broadest cloud-native global SaaS platform purpose-built for modern supply chains, we connect manufacturing, logistics, channel and distributing partners as one multi-enterprise network. Our SaaS platform anticipates disruptions and opportunities to help companies improve efficiency, reduce waste and operate sustainably. In aggregate, we serve clients in all major countries in the world across a wide range of end-markets, including consumer goods, food and beverage, manufacturing, retail, industrial and automotive, aerospace and defense, technology and transportation, among others. 
 We operate in what we believe is an attractive industry with strong secular tailwinds and a total addressable market which includes significant whitespace within our current client base. This upsell opportunity within our existing client base is largely driven by their current technology solution which is often a combination of legacy point solutions and home-grown applications which could be a combination of manual processes and spreadsheets. As manufacturing continues to evolve, supply chains have grown more complex creating the need for a modern cloud-based solution. We believe our cloud-based, end-to-end software platform offers a differentiated and more connected solution for clients that provides all the mechanisms needed to run a fully integrated supply chain solution with visibility at every point. If our clients initially purchase portions of our software, they can add on additional modules as the need arises.

The decrease in subscriptions revenue was primarily due to lower new bookings and elevated churn over the past twelve months. 
 Professional services and other revenue were 20.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, a 3.1 million, or 13 , decrease compared to 23.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in professional services and other revenue was due to lower billable hours partially driven by a higher focus of resources on retention and customer satisfaction. 
 Our subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 86 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 85 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily due to a decline in professional services revenue. Our professional services and other revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 14 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 15 for the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

General and administrative expenses were 21.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024, a 17.0 million, or 44 , decrease compared to 38.6 million in the prior year. The decrease was mainly a result of the 17.8 million accrual in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as a result of an unfavorable arbitration ruling and settlement related to a 2014 contract between Kewill (a predecessor of BluJay) and a customer regarding Kewill's performance under the agreement. This decrease was partially offset by 3.0 million of higher share-based compensation expense with the majority of the increase related to awards for onboarding our new CEO.

During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we recorded a gain of 2.9 million related to the change in the fair value of the tax receivable agreement liability, including interest, compared to 7.9 million during the three months ended August 31, 2023. We have calculated the fair value of the tax receivable agreement payments and identified the timing of the utilization of the tax attributes. The tax receivable agreement liability, related to exchanges as of the Business Combination date, is revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in gain (loss) from change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change occurred. 
 In addition, under ASC 450, transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis. During the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Tax Receivable Agreement applicable to this guidance increased by a negligible amount, respectively.

Additionally, we incurred lower spend for consulting of 1.5 million and facilities of 1.3 million for such items as rent and building maintenance due to office closures resulting from moving to a more remote workforce. These decreases were partially offset by 7.7 million of higher share-based compensation expense with the majority of the increase related to awards for onboarding our new CEO when compared to the prior year period.

The decline in our stock price and market capitalization during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was also a triggering event which resulted in an interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment. The result of the impairment assessment was the realization of a 4.0 million impairment charge during the first half of fiscal 2024. We did not have an impairment charge in the first half of fiscal 2025.

Interest and other expense, net was 50.5 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024, a 0.7 million, or 1 , decrease compared to 51.2 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower realized exchange losses and additional interest income from money market funds partially offset by higher interest expense on our debt due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024.

During the six months ended August 31, 2024, we recorded a loss of 1.1 million related to the change in the fair value of the tax receivable agreement liability, including interest, compared to a gain of 5.5 million during the six months ended August 31, 2023. We have calculated the fair value of the tax receivable agreement payments and identified the timing of the utilization of the tax attributes. The tax receivable agreement liability, related to exchanges as of the Business Combination date, is revalued at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss as well as the associated interest reflected in gain (loss) from change in tax receivable agreement liability in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change occurred. 
 In addition, under ASC 450, transactions with partnership unit holders after the acquisition date will result in additional Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities that are recorded on a gross undiscounted basis. During the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the Tax Receivable Agreement applicable to this guidance increased by 0.5 million and a negligible amount, respectively.

The change in the income tax benefit between periods was primarily due to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges in fiscal 2024. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This document includes Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP performance measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. 
 We calculate and define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items. We define and calculate EBITDA as net income or losses excluding interest income or expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted for the following items: goodwill impairment charge, indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, right-of-use assets impairment charge, transaction-related costs, gain (loss) from change in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration, share-based compensation and certain other non-cash and non-recurring items as described in the reconciliation below. We also report Non-GAAP gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Non-GAAP revenue as additional measures to evaluate financial performance. 
 37 

We include these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain expenses that are required in accordance with U.S. GAAP because they are non-recurring (for example, in the case of transaction-related costs, litigation settlements, goodwill impairment charge, indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge and right-of-use assets impairment charge), non-cash (for example, in the case of depreciation, amortization, gain (loss) from change in the tax receivable agreement liability, (gain) loss from changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and contingent consideration and share-based compensation) or are not related to our underlying business performance (for example, in the case of interest income and expense). There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in the U.S. GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from U.S. GAAP financial measures such as net income or loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We measure liquidity in terms of our ability to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital, capital expenditure needs, contractual obligations and other commitments, with cash flows from operations and other sources of funding. Current working capital needs relate mainly to employee compensation and benefits, as well as interest and debt. Our ability to expand and grow our business will depend on many factors, including working capital needs and the evolution of our operating cash flows. 
 We had 142.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and 155.0 million of unused borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of August 31, 2024. See Note 10, Notes Payable to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, the borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt repayment and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing. 
 Debt 
 2021 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility 
 In February 2021, E2open, LLC, our subsidiary, entered into the Credit Agreement which provided for the 2021 Term Loan in the amount of 525.0 million and the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility for 75.0 million. In September 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a 380.0 million incremental term loan, an increase in the letter of credit sublimit from 15.0 million to 30.0 million and an increase in the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility from 75.0 million to 155.0 million. In April 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended to include a 190.0 million incremental term loan bringing our total borrowing under the term loans to 1,095.0 million. 
 The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will mature on February 4, 2026. E2open, LLC can request increases in the revolving commitments and additional term loan facilities, in minimum amounts of 2.0 million for each facility. Principal payments are due on the Credit Agreement the last day of February, May, August and November. The Credit Agreement is payable in quarterly installments of 2.7 million. The Credit Agreement is payable in full on February 4, 2028. 
 The 2021 Term Loan has a variable interest rate resulting in an interest rate of 8.86 and 8.95 as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively, which was based on SOFR plus 350 basis points. As of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, the 2021 Term Loan had a principal balance outstanding of 1,061.8 million and 1,067.2 million, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings, no letters of credit and 155.0 million available borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024. 
 Beginning in March 2023, we entered into zero-cost interest rate collars to reduce our exposure to the variability of our interest rate associated with our outstanding debt. By keeping interest rates within the executed bands, or caps and floors, of the collars, we are able to reduce exposure to the interest rate risk. Effective March 31, 2023, we entered into an interest rate collar with a notional amount of 200.0 million and a maturity date of March 31, 2026. The executed cap was 4.75 and the floor was 2.57 . Effective April 6, 2023, an additional interest rate collar was executed with a notional amount of 100.0 million and a maturity date of March 31, 2026. The executed cap was 4.50 and the floor was 2.56 .

 Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended August 31, 2024 was 28.4 million compared to 51.3 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023. The 22.8 million decrease in cash was primarily driven by less cash provided by working capital items in fiscal 2025 from such items as the following: 
 decrease in cash from channel client deposits; 

an increase in the cash used for accounts payable and accrued liabilities which includes items such as accrued compensation, trade accounts payable and accrued litigation; and 

an increase in the cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets which includes items such as prepaid software and hardware license and maintenance fees, insurance, taxes and deferred commissions. 

Net cash used in investing activities was 12.3 million and 16.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which represented cash used for the acquisition of software and property related to our data centers. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 6.3 million and 7.8 million for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Repayments under the 2021 Term Loan were consistent between periods at 5.5 million. Additionally, we paid 1.4 million in additional finance lease payment in fiscal 2024 than in fiscal 2025. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 Concurrently with the completion of the Business Combination, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with certain selling equity holders of E2open Holdings. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides for the payment by the Company of 85 of certain tax benefits that are realized or deemed realized as a result of increases in tax, utilization of pre-existing tax attributes of certain sellers and realization of additional tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement for an amount representing the present value of anticipated future tax benefits under the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15 of these cash savings. 
 Amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be contingent upon, among other things, our generation of taxable income over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the Tax Receivable Agreement to utilize the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would not be required to make the related payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although the amount of any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be significant, the timing of these payments will vary and will generally be limited to one payment per member per year. During the six months ended August 31, 2024, we paid 1.8 million to Tax Receivable Agreement holders of E2open Holdings. We did not make any payments to Tax Receivable Agreement holders of E2open Holdings prior to fiscal 2025.

The liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement was 69.5 million and 69.7 million as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively, assuming (1) a corporate tax rate of 23.7 as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, (2) no dispositions of corporate subsidiaries, (3) no material changes in tax law and (4) we do not elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, due to the uncertainty of various factors, including: (a) the timing and value of future exchanges, (b) the amount and timing of our future taxable income, (c) changes in our tax rate, (d) no future dispositions of any corporate stock, (e) changes in the tax law and (f) changes in the discount rate, the likely tax savings we will realize and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay to the selling equity holders of E2open Holdings pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement are uncertain. Interest accrued on the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability recorded under ASC 805 at a rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points through June 30, 2023. Beginning July 1, 2023, interest will accrue at SOFR plus the applicable spread for the quarter. The portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability under ASC 450 is recorded on a gross undiscounted basis. These transactions, such as a conversion of Common Units to Class A Common Stock, result in a change in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability and a charge to equity. 
 The liability recorded on the balance sheet does not include an estimate of the amount of payments to be made if certain sellers exchanged their remaining interests in E2open Holdings for our common stock, as this amount is dependent on several future variables, including timing of future exchanges, stock price at date of exchange, tax attributes of the individual parties to the exchange and changes in future applicable federal and state tax rates. 
 In addition, if we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or certain other acceleration events occur, we will be required to make immediate cash payments. Such cash payments will be equal to the present value of the assumed future realized tax benefits based on a set of assumptions and using an agreed upon discount rate, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement. The early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits. Such payments will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including that we have sufficient taxable income to utilize the full amount of any tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement over the period specified therein. The payments that we would be required to make will generally reduce the amount of the overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us, but we expect the cash tax savings we will realize from the utilization of the related tax benefits will exceed the amount of any required payments. 
 As of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, we had a current Tax Receivable Agreement liability of 6.8 million and 1.8 million, respectively, which was recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of current and long-term is based on management's estimate of taxable income for the fiscal year and the determination that a Tax Receivable Agreement liability payment is due and payable within the next twelve months. To the extent the estimate differs from actual results, a reclass may be required for portions of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability between current and long-term. 
 We are entitled to receive quarterly tax distributions from E2open Holdings, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law and contractual restrictions. The cash received from such tax distributions will first be used to satisfy any tax liability and then make any payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We expect that such tax distributions will be sufficient to fund both our tax liability and the required payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 Warrant Liability 
 As of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, there were an aggregate of 29,079,872 warrants outstanding. Each warrant entitles its holder to purchase one share of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. The warrants are recorded as a liability in warrant liability on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with a balance of 6.6 million and 14.7 million as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively. During the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, a gain of 4.4 million and 1.5 million was recognized in gain from change in fair value of the warrant liability in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. During the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, a gain of 8.2 million and 16.2 million was recognized in gain from change in fair value of the warrant liability, respectively. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 The contingent consideration liability was 18.3 million and 18.0 million as of August 31, 2024 and February 29, 2024, respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a gain of 2.0 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value remeasurements resulted in a loss of 0.2 million and a gain of 10.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the contingent consideration is recognized in gain (loss) from change in fair value of the contingent consideration in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The contingent liability represents the Series B-2 common stock and Series 2 RCUs. 
 43 

Leases 
 We account for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets on the balance sheet for contracts that provide lessees with the right to control the use of identified assets for periods of greater than 12 months. 
 Our non-cancelable operating leases for our office spaces and vehicles have various expiration dates through September 2031. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of August 31, 2024 were: 4.3 million for September 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025, 7.0 million for fiscal 2026, 5.7 million for fiscal 2027, 3.3 million for fiscal 2028, 1.4 million for fiscal 2029 and 1.5 million thereafter. These numbers include interest of 2.8 million. 
 Our non-cancelable financing lease arrangements relate to software and computer equipment and have various expiration dates through November 2028. We have the right to purchase the software and computer equipment anytime during the lease or upon lease completion. Under these leases, our undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the calculation of the lease liabilities as of August 31, 2024 were: 1.3 million for September 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025, 2.4 million for fiscal 2026, 1.9 million for fiscal 2027, 1.0 million for fiscal 2028 and 0.6 million for fiscal 2029. These numbers include interest of 0.8 million. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amount of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 from those previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2, Accounting Standards to the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 There have been no material changes in the market risks during the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 from those previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our 2024 Form 10-K. 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have disclosure controls and procedures in place to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. These controls and procedures are accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report. In designing and evaluating these disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 44 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We review our disclosure controls and procedures, which may include internal controls over financial reporting, on an ongoing basis. From time to time, management makes changes to enhance the effectiveness of these controls and ensure that they continue to meet the needs of our business over time. 
 PART II Other Information 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we have exposure and are subject to contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business for a variety of claims. We record an accrual for a contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We do not currently believe the resolution of any other such contingencies will have a material adverse effect upon our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations or Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes in our risk factors during the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2024 Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our 2024 Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 
 During the quarter ended August 31, 2024 , none of our directors and officers , or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). 
 Cybersecurity 
 Our Executive Vice President, Product Development Infrastructure R D, who was responsible for supervising our Cyber Program, left the Company on September 6, 2024 and our General Counsel assumed that role. The information below has been updated as a result of the transition. 
 Our processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats are embodied in our enterprise-wide cybersecurity risk management program (Cyber Risk Program), which governs our cybersecurity oversight and management structure as well as our cybersecurity strategy and processes. 
 Governance Structure 
 Board of Directors Oversight 
 The Risk Committee of our board of directors is responsible for the oversight of our Cyber Risk Program. The General Counsel reports to the Risk Committee at least quarterly on the status of our Cyber Risk Program. In addition, the Risk Committee receives updates and presentations from the Senior Vice President, Information Security and Compliance (SVP) at each Risk Committee meeting that cover, among other things, our cyber incidents and responses, ongoing cyber threats, material risks, deployment of cybersecurity controls and risk mitigants, engagement of third parties (e.g., consultants and auditors) and third-party tools, our cyber insurance coverages and our employee-training programs. The Risk committee then reports to the full board of directors at each regular meeting of the board of directors. 
 45 

Management s Assessment and Management of Cybersecurity Threats 
 Members of the executive management team, along with others from senior management and others with varying areas of expertise, are engaged as part of our Cyber Risk Program: 
 Senior Vice President, Information Security and Compliance: Our SVP manages our Cyber Risk Program and reports directly to the General Counsel. He manages the day-to-day information security operations, oversees our security analysts and engineers and is a member of our Cybersecurity Subcommittee. He is trained in cybersecurity strategy, planning and execution and holds industry recognized security certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) from the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2) and Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) from the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). Our SVP has extensive experience regarding cybersecurity matters and threats affecting business-to-business software and cloud services vendors such as E2open. 

General Counsel: Our General Counsel, who also serves as our Acting Chief Risk Officer, supervises the SVP's management of our Cyber Risk Program and is the chair of our Cybersecurity Subcommittee of our Disclosure Committee. Our General Counsel has experience providing legal advice regarding cybersecurity-related programs as well as engaging with outside advisors and insurance brokers and underwriters on cybersecurity coverage, claims and loss mitigation. 

Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Disclosure Committee: We have created a Cybersecurity Subcommittee of our management Disclosure Committee which includes the General Counsel, SVP and Chief Accounting Officer. The Cybersecurity Subcommittee meets to discuss whether certain cybersecurity incidents may require public disclosure and makes recommendations regarding potential disclosure to the Disclosure Committee. 

Response Team: Pursuant to our Crisis Response Program, our Response Team, which comprises the General Counsel, SVP, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer and an expanded team from our material business lines and administrative departments as well as outside advisors/experts (cyber forensics, external legal counsel, law enforcement, public relations), is charged with managing the Company through a cybersecurity incident (or other event or series of events) that rise to the level of a Company crisis. The Program includes protocols by which the General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer, on behalf of the Response Team, will report to or engage the Chief Executive Officer, the Risk Committee or the Chairman of the board of directors if and when an incident becomes a crisis or potential crisis. 

Other Roles: The Cyber Risk Program includes engagement of other Company management employees and outside service providers to oversee or perform specific roles in connection with cybersecurity risk assessment and management, and incident management. That includes risk and security heads from our material business lines who implement and administer policies specific to those business lines. 

Risk Management and Strategy 
 Overview of Processes for Assessing, Identifying, and Managing Material Cyber Risks 
 The principal objectives of our Cyber Risk Program are to minimize the risks associated with cybersecurity threats to our business operations, financial performance and financial condition, and protect the confidential information, intellectual property and other assets of E2open, and those of our customers, vendors, partners, employees and consumers that can be at risk due to cybersecurity threats to E2open. 
 We have incorporated industry recognized cybersecurity frameworks and standards into our Cyber Risk Program, including frameworks from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and security control auditing protocols from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the International Organizations for Standardization (ISO). Recognizing that the nature of cybersecurity threats and the particular threat vectors we face continually change, we continue to invest in updating and enhancing our Cyber Risk Program. 
 Under our Cyber Risk Program, our SVP and the cybersecurity staff, along with the Response Team, with input where appropriate from our third-party advisors, work to identify our cybersecurity threats, assess the risks and deploy appropriate technologies and processes to mitigate the risks. When cybersecurity incidents occur, these resources work to manage through the incident utilizing advanced security tools and playbooks, and in accordance with processes set out in our various policies and practice documents, which include internal communications protocols to keep the executive team and, where appropriate, the Risk Committee and board or directors, informed. Pertinent policy and practice documents include, among others, our Crisis Response Plan, which describes the detailed processes and procedures that should be followed in the event of a cybersecurity incident. 
 46 

As an important cybersecurity risk mitigant, E2open provides mandatory training to its new hires and to existing employees on a regular basis, including phishing simulation tests and follow-up tests as needed, along with monthly cybersecurity newsletters and other cyber risk-related communications. 
 Integration into Overall Risk Management System or Processes 
 The Cyber Risk Program is integrated into the Company's overall risk management systems and processes. Our risk management systems and processes comprise numerous components, including published policies and procedures; risk detection systems, tools and protocols (automated and human); internal and external independent auditing; management committee review; defined lines of communications; employee training; engagement of outside advisors and experts; assessment and utilization of both commercial and self-insurance opportunities; customer contract standardization where possible; legal review of vendor engagements and new products for regulatory compliance; and regular operations reviews with the Chief Executive Officer and Risk Committee. E2open utilizes the foregoing systems and processes to manage our risks and associated cybersecurity threats. 
 Engagement of Third Parties 
 As part of our Cyber Risk Program, we engage outside independent auditors, consultants and professional advisors. We use independent auditors to certify compliance with our internal control over financial reporting, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Systems and Organization Controls (SOC 2) security framework. We also conduct reviews for compliance with data protection regulation such as Europe s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and regulation of various U.S. states such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We also engage industry-leading cybersecurity service and systems providers to assist with protection from and detection of cybersecurity threats and incidents and our responses to them. 
 Risks from Third Party Service Providers and Others 
 Our cybersecurity team, under the oversight of the SVP, performs risk assessments on third party service providers and other third parties (such as partner companies), as well as third party software and hardware utilized in its operations, that may have the potential to create cybersecurity threats to our data and operations. Based on the results of these regular assessments (including assessments made before engaging a third party), we may decide to take action to address and mitigate certain risks or determine that the risk is not acceptable and terminate the relationship with the third party (or determine not to engage a third party). 
 Risks from Cybersecurity Threats Likely Material Impact 
 To date, E2open has not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents. We can provide no assurance that there will not be incidents in the future or that they will not materially affect us, including our business strategy, financial condition or results of operations.
