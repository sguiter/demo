1895 BANCORP OF WISCONSIN, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) of the common stock being held by the public. The consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in these consolidated financial statements are for New 1895 Bancorp. The cost of the reorganization and the issuing of the common stock totaling million were deferred and deducted from the sales proceeds of the offering. PyraMax Bank is a stock savings bank headquartered in Greenfield, Wisconsin. PyraMax Bank operates as a full-service financial institution, providing a full range of financial services, including the granting of commercial, residential, and consumer loans and acceptance of deposits from individual customers and small businesses in the metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin area. PyraMax Bank is subject to competition from other financial and nonfinancial institutions providing financial products. In addition, PyraMax Bank is subject to the regulations of certain regulatory agencies and undergoes periodic examination by those regulatory agencies. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2024. In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, mortgage servicing rights, the fair value of financial instruments and the valuation of deferred income tax assets. On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies and define an emerging growth company. As an emerging growth company, the Company may delay adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until such date that the standards are required to be adopted by non-issuer companies. If such standards would not apply to non-issuer companies, no deferral would be applicable. The Company intends to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition periods allowed under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, the Company s financial statements may not be comparable to those of public companies that adopt new or revised financial accounting standards as of an earlier date. The effective dates of the recent accounting standards in Note 2 reflect those that relate to non-issuer companies.

The Company does not consider these unrealized losses to be attributable to credit-related factors, as the unrealized losses in each category have occurred as a result of changes in noncredit-related factors such as changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase, not credit deterioration. As a result, allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities was recognized as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 .

(1) million a t both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , and which is recorded separately on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Deposit accounts in an overdrawn position and reclassified as loans totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company provides several types of loans to its customers, including commercial, residential, construction and consumer loans. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to one borrower, or to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities, that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. While credit risks tend to be geographically concentrated in the Company's metropolitan Milwaukee market area, and while a significant portion of the Company s loan portfolio is secured by commercial and residential real estate, there are no significant concentrations whose primary sources of repayment are reliant upon an individual or group of related borrowers. The Company also purchases loan participations from other financial institutions. The outstanding balance of loans purchased are included in the totals above and totale d million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023 . In addition, the amount available for future draws totaled million at September 30, 2024. Loans purchased are primarily comprised of commercial real estate and other commercial loans and are subject to the same underwriting standards as loans that are originated by the Company. During the normal course of business, the Company may transfer a portion of a loan as a participation loan to another financial institution in order to manage portfolio risk. In order to be eligible for sales treatment, all cash flows from the loan must be divided proportionately, and rights of each loan holder must have the same priority, the loan holders must have no recourse to the transferor other than standard representations and warranties, and no loan holder can have the right to pledge or exchange the entire loan. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance of participation loans transferred to other financial institutions and which were eligible for sales treatment totaled million and million, respectively, all of which continue to be serviced by the Company.

The Company regularly evaluates various attributes of loans to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. The credit quality indicators monitored differ depending on the class of loan. The credit quality indicators for commercial real estate and other commercial loans are based on the following ratings: "Pass" ratings are assigned to loans with adequate collateral and debt service ability such that collectability of the contractual loan payments is highly probable. 

 "Watch and Special Mention" ratings are assigned to loans where management has some concern that the collateral or debt service ability may not be adequate, though the collectability of the contractual loan payments is still probable. 

 "Substandard" ratings are assigned to loans that do not have adequate collateral and/or debt service ability such that collectability of the contractual loan payments is no longer probable. 

 "Doubtful" ratings are assigned to loans that do not have adequate collateral and/or debt service ability such that collectability of the contractual loan payments is unlikely. 

 Residential real estate and consumer loans are generally evaluated based on whether or not the loan is performing or in nonaccrual status. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024, for additional information on our nonaccrual policy.

Actual maturities may differ from scheduled maturities due to call options on various FHLB advances. The FHLB provides both fixed and floating rate advances. Floating rates are tied to short-term market rates of interest such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), federal funds or Treasury bill rates. FHLB advances are subject to a prepayment penalty if they are repaid prior to maturity. The Company has pledged qualifying real estate and commercial and industrial loans with collateral values of approximately million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 . FHLB advances were also secured by approximately million and million of FHLB stock held by the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The Company s available and unused portion of this borrowing agreement totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additional borrowing would require additional stock purchase. Additionally, at September 30, 2024 we had a million federal funds rate line of credit with the BMO Harris Bank, none of which was drawn at September 30, 2024. The Company also had an million line of credit at the Federal Reserve based on pledged commercial real estate loans of approximately million at September 30, 2024 . The Company had t drawn on the Federal Reserve line as of September 30, 2024 .

for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company recorded income tax expense of million and million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. On July 5, 2023, the Wisconsin legislature enacted 2023 Wisconsin Act 19 (the "Act"). The Act contained a provision that provides financial institutions with a state tax-exemption for interest, fees and penalties earned on qualifying loans. For the exemption to apply, the loan must be million or less, for primarily a business or agricultural purpose, and made to borrowers residing or located in Wisconsin. The exemption first applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, and applies to loans on the books as of January 1, 2023 and to new loans made after January 1, 2023, that meet the qualifications. As a result of this change in tax law, we did not record any income tax benefit for Wisconsin state taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, during the second quarter of 2023, this tax law change resulted in a million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the recording of a reduction in tax benefits previously booked for the six months ended June 30, 2023, resulting in a one-time million increase in tax expense in the third quarter of 2023. Deferred tax assets are deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards. After the deferred tax asset has been measured using the applicable enacted tax rate and provisions of the enacted tax law, it is then necessary to assess the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is needed when, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred asset will not be realized. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, available evidence is weighted heavily on cumulative losses, with less weight placed on future projected profitability. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the existence of taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary or capital) within the carry-back and carry-forward periods available under tax law, which would consider future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the deferred tax valuation allowance w as million and million, respectively, reducing our net deferred tax assets to million and million at each respective date. The board and management continue to assess the deferred tax assets in light of recent changes in market conditions, forecasted future projected income and available tax planning strategies. As such, there may be additional deferred tax asset impairment in subsequent periods.

million i n outstanding commitments to deliver loans through the Program as of September 30, 2024. Once delivered to the Program, the Company provides a contractually agreed-upon credit enhancement and performs servicing of the loans. Under the credit enhancement, the Company is liable for losses on loans delivered through the Program after application of any mortgage insurance and a contractually agreed-upon credit enhancement provided by the Program, subject to an agreed-upon maximum. The Company receives a fee for this credit enhancement. The Company records a liability for expected losses in excess of anticipated credit enhancement fees. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 , the Company had liability outstanding related to the Program. Unfunded commitments under overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers.

On January 8, 2019, the ESOP purchased shares shares adjusted for the 2021 conversion) of the Company s common stock, which was funded by a loan from Old 1895 Bancorp. Unreleased ESOP shares collateralize the loan payable, and the cost of the shares is recorded as contra-equity account in the stockholders equity of the Company. Shares are to be released as debt payments are made by the ESOP to the loan. The ESOP s sources of repayment of the loan can include dividends, if any, on the unallocated stock held by the ESOP, and discretionary contributions from the Company to the ESOP and earnings thereon. As part of the mutual-to-stock conversion and stock offering completed on July 14, 2021, the ESOP refinanced the aforementioned loan with New 1895 Bancorp, enabling the ESOP to purchase an aggregate of additional shares of common stock. The ESOP completed the purchase of all the additional shares at an average price of in the second quarter of 2022. Compensation expense for the ESOP is recorded at an amount equal to the shares allocated by the ESOP multiplied by the average fair market value of the shares during the period. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the year based upon the Company s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the ESOP. Unearned compensation applicable to the ESOP is reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the ESOP is recorded as an adjustment to stockholders equity. The Company recognized an d in compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

collateral dependent loans for which a specific valuation allowance was established as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. There was impairment on mortgage servicing rights as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company estimates fair value of all financial instruments regardless of whether such instruments are measured at fair value. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company to estimate fair value of financial instruments not previously discussed. Cash and cash equivalents Fair value approximates the carrying value. Loans held for sale Fair value is based on commitments on hand from investors or prevailing market prices. Loans Fair value of variable rate loans that reprice frequently is based on carrying values. Fair value of other loans is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Fair value of collateral dependent and other non-performing loans is estimated using discounted expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral, if applicable. FHLB stock Fair value is the redeemable (carrying) value based on the redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank. Accrued interest receivable and payable Fair value approximates the carrying value. Cash value of life insurance Fair value is based on reported values of the assets. Deposits and advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance Fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as demand deposits, savings, and money market accounts, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance, by definition, is the amount payable on demand on the reporting date. Fair value of fixed rate time deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying interest rates currently being offered on similar time deposits. FHLB Advances Fair value of fixed rate, fixed term borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current rates at which similar borrowings would be made. Fair value of borrowings with variable rates or maturing within 90 days approximates the carrying value of those borrowings.

 Limitations The fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between market participants, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best determined based on quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. Consequently, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters that could affect the estimates. Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance-sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business. Deposits with no stated maturities are defined as having a fair value equivalent to the amount payable on demand. This prohibits adjusting fair value derived from retaining those deposits for an expected future period of time. This component, commonly referred to as a deposit base intangible, is neither considered in the above amounts, nor is it recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheets. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

The fair value of stock grants is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. Compensation expense is included in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of operations. Assumptions are used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted. The weighted average expected life of the stock options represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the historical results from the previous awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on the actual volatility of 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, Inc. stock for the weighted average lifetime period prior to issuance date.

I tem 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, continue, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

 statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

 statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and 

 estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

 These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: our ability to maintain liquidity, primarily through deposits, in light of recent events in the banking industry; 

 general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected; 

 changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; 

 inflation and/or changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, our mortgage banking revenues, the fair value of financial instruments, including our mortgage servicing rights asset, or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we have made and make; 

 our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk; 

 our ability to access cost-effective funding; 

 fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; 

 demand for loans and deposits in our market area; 

 our ability to implement and change our business strategies; 

 competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

 adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets; 

 changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums; 

 changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; 

 technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; 

 the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; 

 a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; 

 our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; 

35 

our ability to successfully integrate into our operations any assets, liabilities, customers, systems and management personnel we have acquired or may acquire and our ability to realize related revenue synergies and cost savings within expected time frames, and any goodwill charges related thereto; 

 changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

 changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including the effects of our adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL accounting standard, which we implemented on January 1, 2023; 

 our ability to retain key employees; 

 our compensation expense associated with equity allocated or awarded to our employees; and 

 changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 

 Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Additional factors that may affect our results are discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K (fiscal year ended December 31, 2023) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 29, 2024, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake, and we specifically disclaim any obligation, to release publicly the results of any revisions that may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Policies As a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company s business, management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ), but also reflects management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company s financial performance. It is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of subjectivity in the selection process. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could meaningfully differ from these estimates. Management believes that the critical accounting estimates include the allowance for credit losses, determination of fair value for financial instruments, and valuation of deferred income taxes. A summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 29, 2024. During 2024, we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the remaining critical accounting estimates from those described in the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Total Assets. Total assets increased 6.9 million, or 1.2 , to 564.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 557.6 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 12.4 million net increase in cash and cash equivalents and a 3.0 million increase in loans, partially offset by a 9.3 million decrease in available-for-sale securities. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 12.4 million, or 93.2 , to 25.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 13.3 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 4.8 million net increase in FHLB advances, a 8.6 million increase in advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance and 13.6 million from maturities, payments and calls of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by an 8.4 million decrease in deposits, a 3.0 million increase in loans and the purchase of 2.0 million in available-for-sale securities. Available-for-Sale Securities. Available-for-sale securities decreased 9.3 million, or 8.5 , to 100.3 million at September 30, 2024, from 109.6 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to maturities, payments and calls of securities totaling 13.6 million, partially offset by and a 2.4 million decrease in the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities and the 

 36 

purchase of 2.0 million of available-for-sale securities. The net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities held in the portfolio was 7.1 million at September 30, 2024. Loans. Loans held for investment, net of deferred costs, increased 3.0 million, or 0.8 , to 401.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 398.6 million at December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily the result of a 2.4 million increase in commercial loans and a 2.0 million increase in commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a 1.5 million decrease in first mortgage residential real estate loans. Allowance for Credit Losses. The allowance for credit losses for loans was 4.0 million, or 0.99 , of loans, net of deferred costs, at September 30, 2024 compared to an allowance for credit losses for loans of 3.7 million, or 0.94 of loans, net of deferred costs, at December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, we recorded a 121,000 provision for credit losses and 111,000 in net recoveries. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments was 979,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to 875,000 at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments was the result of a 104,000 provision for credit losses. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.23 of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 0.28 at December 31, 2023. FHLB Stock. FHLB stock increased 400,000, or 9.5 , from 4.2 million at December 31, 2023 to 4.6 million at September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the requirement by the FHLB to hold additional stock as a result of the increased level of advances. Deposits. Deposits decreased 8.4 million, or 2.1 , to 395.3 million at September 30, 2024, from 403.7 million at December 31, 2023. During this period, noninterest bearing checking accounts decreased 7.1 million, or 9.0 , interest bearing checking accounts decreased 1.8 million, or 6.2 , money market accounts increased 7.1 million, or 8.0 , and savings accounts decreased 6.5 million million, or 14.0 . Certificates of deposit were relatively unchanged, at 161.1 million at both periods. Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance. Advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance increased 8.6 million to 9.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 1.2 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to normal seasonal activity. FHLB Advances. FHLB advances increased 4.8 million, or 6.8 , to 75.8 million at September 30, 2024, from 71.0 million at December 31, 2023. The level of FHLB advances was increased to fund cash outflows related to loans and deposits. Total Stockholders Equity. Total stockholders equity increased 413,000 to 73.2 million at September 30, 2024, from 72.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to other comprehensive income of 1.7 million as a result of a decrease in the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, and 504,000 as a result of the equity impact of stock compensation expense, partially offset by a net loss of 981,000 and the Company's purchase of 1.0 million of its common stock under its stock repurchase plan.

Average Balances and Yields The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information at and for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but are reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred costs, premiums and discounts that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.

Rate/Volume Analysis The following tables present the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in average rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior period average rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Comparison of Operating Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Loss. We recorded a net loss of 159,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a 1.9 million net loss on sale of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 1.7 million decrease in income tax expense and a 358,000 increase in other noninterest income (excluding net loss on sale of securities) in the current quarter, partially offset by a 577,000 increase in noninterest expenses. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 648,000, or 12.0 , to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 377,000 increase in interest and fees on loans and a 290,000 increase in interest income on securities. The increase in interest and fees earned on loans was primarily due to a 17.9 million increase in the average amount of loans outstanding, from 384.3 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 402.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, and an 18 basis point increase in the yield earned on loans, from 4.57 for the third quarter of 2023 to 4.75 in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in the yield earned on loans during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to higher yields on new loans and existing loans that have repriced at higher rates since the third quarter of 2023, as a result of higher market interest rates. The increase in loans outstanding is consistent with the Company's strategy to grow the loan portfolio. The increase in interest on securities was primarily due to a 122 basis point increase in the yield earned on securities, from 2.45 for the third quarter of 2023 to 3.67 in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 3.4 million decrease in the average amount of securities outstanding. The increase in yield and interest income on securities was primarily due to the previously disclosed balance sheet repositioning strategies that the Company implemented during 2023. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 595,000, or 24.8 , to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 689,000 increase in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by a 95,000 decrease in interest expense on FHLB advances. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 70 basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and a 21.1 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits outstanding from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to the increase in market rates of interest and a shift in our deposit mix. As market rates increased, many of our deposit customers transferred funds from noninterest bearing checking accounts and lower rate deposit accounts into higher rate certificates of deposit. During this period, the average balance of noninterest bearing checking accounts decreased 2.3 million, or 3.2 , NOW accounts decreased 1.9 million, or 6.4 and savings accounts decreased 9.2 million, or 18.3 . During the same period, the average balance of certificates of deposits increased 30.2 million, or 22.3 and money market accounts increased 1.9 million, or 21.8 . Interest expense on certificates of deposit increased 596,000 from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the increase in average balance and a 75 basis point increase in the average rate paid on these accounts. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased 53,000, or 1.8 , to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a 648,000 increase in interest income partially offset by a 595,000 increase in interest expense. Our net interest rate spread decreased 11 basis points to 1.64 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin was 2.29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses was 75,000 for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision in each period was primarily due to an increase in average loans outstanding in each of the respective periods. Noninterest Income . Noninterest income increased 2.3 million, from negative 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 900,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to a 1.9 million net loss on sale of securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a 406,000 increase in the unrealized gain (loss) on marketable equity securities. The loss on sale of securities was a result of the balance sheet repositioning strategies that the Company implemented during 2023. The increase in unrealized gains on marketable equity securities was due to an increase in the market value of mutual funds held in our deferred compensation plan. We record an offsetting amount for the change in the market value of equity securities in noninterest expense. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 577,000, or 15.6 , to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 281,000 increase in salaries and benefits expense and a 406,000 increase in unrealized gains on marketable equity securities. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to a 199,000 increase in bonus expense and a 64,000 increase in deferred compensation 

 41 

expense. During 2023, we adjusted our bonus program, which resulted in no bonus expense for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in deferred compensation expense was as a result of an increase in the value of our stock held in the deferred compensation plan. The Company continues to implement cost savings initiatives, including the review of all open positions prior to rehiring. This initiative has resulted in a reduction in the number of full-time equivalent employees from 106 at September 30, 2022, to 88 at September 30, 2024. The increase in unrealized gains on marketable equity securities was due to an increase in the market value of mutual funds held in our deferred compensation plan. We record an offsetting amount for the change in the market value of equity securities in noninterest income. Income Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax benefit of 298,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in income tax expense (benefit) was primarily due to the impact of the change in Wisconsin tax law in July 2023, retroactive to January 2023. As a result of this change in tax law, we did not record any income tax benefit for Wisconsin state taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, during the second quarter of 2023, this tax law change resulted in a 1.8 million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the recording of a 98,000 reduction in tax benefits previously booked for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Comparison of Operating Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Net Loss. We recorded a net loss of 981,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to a 2.3 million increase in noninterest income and a 1.6 million decrease in income tax expense (benefit), partially offset by a 319,000 increase in noninterest expenses. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 3.2 million, or 21.2 , to 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 15.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a 2.0 million increase in interest and fees on loans and an 1.1 million increase in interest income on securities. The increase in interest and fees earned on loans was primarily due to a 24.4 million increase in the average amount of loans outstanding, from 375.8 million in the first nine months of 2023 to 400.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, and a 41 basis point increase in the yield earned on loans, from 4.44 for the first nine months of 2023 to 4.85 in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in the yield earned on loans during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to higher yields on new loans and existing loans that have repriced at higher rates since the first nine months of 2023, as a result of higher market interest rates. The increase in loans is consistent with the Company's strategy to grow the loan portfolio. The increase in interest on securities was primarily due to a 157 basis point increase in the yield earned on securities, from 2.24 for the first nine months of 2023 to 3.81 in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in yield was primarily due to the balance sheet repositioning strategies that the Company implemented during 2023. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 3.2 million, or 55.2 , to 9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 3.3 million increase in interest expense on deposits. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 118 basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits and a 31.8 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits outstanding from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to the increase in market rates of interest and a shift in our deposit mix. As market rates increased, many of our deposit customers transferred funds from noninterest bearing checking accounts and lower rate deposit accounts into higher rate certificates of deposit. The average balance of noninterest bearing checking accounts decreased 7.2 million, or 9.3 , NOW accounts decreased 2.3 million, or 7.6 , savings accounts decreased 11.3 million, or 20.8 , and money market accounts decreased 15.3 million, or 15.0 , respectively, from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024. During the same period, the average balance of certificates of deposits increased 60.7 million, or 57.9 . Interest expense on certificates of deposit increased 3.2 million from the first nine months of 2023 to the first nine months of 2024 as a result of the increase in average balance and also a 150 basis point increase in the average rate paid on these accounts. Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 24,000, or 0.3 , to 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a 3.2 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a 3.2 million increase in interest and dividend income. Our net interest rate spread decreased 25 basis points to 1.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 10 basis points to 2.36 , from 2.46 over the same period. Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses was 225,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The provision was primarily due to an increase in average loans outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in average loans outstanding and loan commitments that are expected to fund for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

 42 

Noninterest Income . Noninterest income increased 2.3 million, to 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 306,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 1.9 million net loss on sale of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 439,000 increase in the unrealized gain on marketable equity securities and a 184,000 increase in net gain on sale of loans, partially offset by a 230,000 decrease in other noninterest income. The loss on sale of securities was a result of the balance sheet repositioning strategies that the Company implemented during 2023. The increase in unrealized gains on marketable equity securities was due to an increase in the market value of mutual funds held in our deferred compensation plan. We record an offsetting amount for the change in the market value of equity securities in noninterest expense. The increase in net gain on sale of loans is primarily due to an increase in the origination and sale of mortgage loans, which increased to 17.1 million and 17.6 million, respectively during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 8.9 million and 8.8 million, respectively, during the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to a 157,000 gain from the collection of benefits from a bank owned life insurance policy received in the second quarter of 2023 and a 110,000 gain on the sale of our former branch facility in West Allis in the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 319,000, or 2.5 , to 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 439,000 increase in unrealized gains on marketable equity securities and a 374,000 increase in other noninterest expenses, partially offset by a 332,000 decrease in salaries and benefits expense. The increase in unrealized gains on marketable equity securities was due to an increase in the market value of mutual funds held in our deferred compensation plan. We record an offsetting amount for the change in the market value of equity securities in noninterest income. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily due to 358,000 in professional fees related to the renegotiation and renewal of our core data processing contract. The renegotiation of this contract is expected to result in a 1.5 million reduction in data processing expenses over the term of the contract. The decrease in salaries and benefits expense was primarily the result of cost savings initiatives implemented by the Company, including the review of all open positions prior to rehiring and a reduction-in-force ("RIF") implemented in April 2023. These actions have resulted in a reduction in the number of full-time equivalent employees from 106 at September 30, 2022, to 88 at September 30, 2024. The positive impact of these initiatives was partially offset by a 176,000 increase in deferred compensation expense as a result of an increase in the value of our stock held in the deferred compensation plan during this period. Income Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax benefit of 557,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in income tax expense (benefit) was primarily due to the impact of the change in Wisconsin tax law in July 2023. As a result of this change in tax law, we did not record any income tax benefit for Wisconsin state taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, during the second quarter of 2023, this tax law change resulted in a 1.8 million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and the recording of a 98,000 reduction in tax benefits previously booked for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Management of Market Risk General . Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. Our asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we use to manage interest rate risk are: originating commercial real estate and commercial loans, which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than owner occupied one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger non-interest-bearing checking accounts; 

 selling substantially all of our conforming and eligible jumbo, longer-term, fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans and retaining the non-conforming and shorter-term, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, subject to market conditions and periodic review of our asset/liability management needs; and 

 reducing our dependence on jumbo and brokered certificates of deposit to support lending and investment activities and increasing our reliance on core deposits, including checking accounts and savings accounts, which are less interest rate sensitive than certificates of deposit. 

43 

Our board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of our executive management team and other essential operational staff which are responsible for our asset/liability analysis. These officers act as an asset/liability committee and are charged with developing and implementing an asset/liability management plan, and they meet at least quarterly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. We do not engage in material hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

 Economic Value of Equity . We also monitor interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model that estimates the amounts by which the fair value of our assets and liabilities (our economic value of equity or EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The quarterly reports developed in the simulation model assist us in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate risk to ensure compliance within our policy guidelines. The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in market interest rates. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.

The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, in the event of a 100-basis point increase in interest rates, we would have experienced a 0.69 increase in our EVE and in the event of a 100-basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 0.06 increase in our EVE. In the event of a 200-basis point increase in interest rates at September 30, 2024, we would have experienced a 1.50 decrease in our EVE and in the event of a 200-basis point decrease in interest rates, we would have experienced a 1.75 decrease in our EVE. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and will differ from actual results. EVE calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, FHLB advances, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from the sale of loans, and proceeds from maturities of securities. At September 30, 2024, we had 75.8 million outstanding in FHLB advances. At September 30, 2024, we had 92.5 million in additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, based on the level of qualifying real estate loans currently pledged to the FHLB. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had a 12.0 million federal funds line of credit with the BMO Harris Bank, none of which was drawn at September 30, 2024. The Company also had an 11.3 million line of credit at the Federal Reserve based on pledged commercial real estate loans of approximately 13.7 million at September 30, 2024. The Company had not drawn on the Federal Reserve line as of September 30, 2024. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 342,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash used in operating activities of 324,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of 17.6 million in proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale and a 1.4 million increase in accrued interest payable and other liabilities, partially offset by the origination of 17.1 million in mortgage loans held for sale, a 981,000 net loss and a 726,000 increase in the fair value of marketable equity securities. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of the origination of 8.9 million in mortgage loans held for sale and a 4.5 million net loss, partially offset by 8.8 million in proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale, a 1.9 million net loss on sale of available-for-sale securities and deferred income tax expense of 1.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities was 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of 16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 13.6 million from maturities, calls and payments on available-for-sale securities, partially offset by a 2.9 million increase in loans and 2.0 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of a 23.5 million increase in loans, the purchase of 21.4 million of available-for-sale securities and a 1.4 million increase in FHLB stock, partially offset by 19.5 million in proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities and 9.7 million from maturities, calls and payments on available-for-sale securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was 4.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2024 primarily resulted from borrowings of 72.0 million of FHLB advances and an 8.5 million increase in advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance, partially offset by 67.2 million in principal payments on FHLB advances, an 8.4 million decrease in deposits and 1.0 million in stock repurchases. Net cash provided by financing activities for the first nine months of 2023 primarily resulted from 100.5 million of FHLB advances and a 9.2 million increase in advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance, partially offset by 93.5 million in principal payments on FHLB advances and a 748,000 decrease in deposits. 

 45 

We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments based on our current strategy to increase core deposits, along with the continued use of FHLB advances, as well as brokered certificates of deposit as needed. Capital At September 30, 2024, PyraMax Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage capital level of 63.1 million, or 11.2 of adjusted total assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of 28.2 million, or 5.0 . The Bank had total risk-based capital of 68.1 million, or 16.0 of risk-weighted assets, which is above the well-capitalized required level of 42.5 million, or 10.0 . Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category. For additional information, see Note 13 of the Notes to Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process as the loans we make. For additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowings and deposits, and agreements with respect to securities. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. Item 3. 	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable. Item 4. 	Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
