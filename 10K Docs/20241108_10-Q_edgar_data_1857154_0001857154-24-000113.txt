 million and million gallons of fuel, respectively. They are scheduled to mature between September 2024 and September 2025 and January 2024 and December 2024, respectively. As of both September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded liabilities of million related to the fair market values of its commodity derivatives. The settlement of commodity derivative contracts is reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a cash flow from operating activities. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility from its debt arrangements. Management has designated the swap agreements as cash flow hedges and recognized the changes in the fair value of these swaps in other comprehensive income. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded a liability of million and an asset of million, respectively, related to the fair market values of its interest rate derivatives. The cash flows associated with the interest rate swaps are reflected in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which is consistent with the classification as operating activities of the interest payments on the term loan. 
 In the quarter ended June 30, 2024, existing interest rate swap agreements (the prior agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million matured. The Company then entered into new interest rate swap agreements (the new agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million as of September 29, 2024. The primary difference between the new agreements and the prior agreements included the setting of new rates on the fixed component of the swaps (weighted average of approximately of ). The new agreements have a benchmark rate on the floating component of the swaps of one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and are scheduled to mature in March 2028. 
 The net effect of the interest rate swap arrangements will be to fix the variable interest rate on the term loan under the 2023 Facility (as defined in Note 9 , Long-Term Debt) up to the notional amount outstanding at the rates payable under the swap agreements plus the Applicable Rate (as defined by the 2023 Facility), through the swap maturity dates in March 2028. 
 In the quarter ended April 2, 2023, the Company cancelled certain interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million, collecting million in cash proceeds, and entered into new agreements with the same counterparties. The cash flows are reflected in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily from its investments in consolidated subsidiaries that operate in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and Japan. In order to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on commercial and financial transactions with these subsidiaries, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts. Management has not designated these forward contracts as hedges. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of foreign exchange derivatives was million and million, respectively. The majority matured in October 2024 and January 2024, respectively. The Company recorded assets of million and liabilities of million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to the fair market values of its foreign exchange derivatives.

The Company agrees on commercial terms with vendors for the goods and services procured, which are consistent with payment terms observed at other peer companies in the industry, and as the terms are not impacted by the SCF program, such obligations are classified as Accounts payable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the associated cash flows are included in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 Structured Payables Programs 
 The Company utilizes various card products issued by financial institutions to facilitate purchases of goods and services. By using these products, the Company may receive differing levels of rebates based on timing of repayment. The payment obligations under these card products are classified as Structured payables in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the associated cash flows are included in financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Overview 
 Krispy Kreme is one of the most beloved and well-known sweet treat brands in the world. Krispy Kreme operates in 40 countries with our transformational omni-channel strategy, which focuses on delivering fresh doughnuts such as our iconic Original Glazed doughnut, which is universally recognized for its hot-off-the-line, melt-in-your-mouth experience, to where our consumers are located and want to have access to them. Global Points of Access are a key metric and we define them as our unique network of fresh Doughnut Shops, partnerships with leading retailers (DFD Doors), and a rapidly growing digital business. Our purpose of touching and enhancing lives through the joy that is Krispy Kreme guides how we operate every day and is reflected in the love we have for our people, our communities, and the planet. 
 The following table presents a summary of our financial results for the periods presented:

 Significant Events and Transactions 
 Executing on our Omni-Channel Strategy 
 We made strong progress on the execution of our omni-channel strategy in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as we continue to add quality Global Points of Access across our network and convert markets into fully implemented Hub and Spoke models (discussed in greater detail under Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures below). We added 244 new Krispy Kreme branded Global Points of Access in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to reach 15,811 Global Points of Access. The primary driver of the increased Krispy Kreme branded Global Points of Access during the third quarter was the continued expansion of our DFD network in alignment with our transformation strategy, as we added 210 DFD Doors globally, primarily within the U.S. segment. The increase in DFD Doors is the result of our focus on executing our omni-channel strategy to drive our transformation, and includes expansion with key customers. We expect DFD growth to be one of our most significant drivers of earnings growth, primarily through increased door count and also through optimization of revenue per door. Deployment of the omni-channel strategy in the U.S. led to an increase of 2.1 in Sales per Hub in the trailing four quarters, from 4.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 4.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in our Sales per Hub contributed to U.S. segment organic revenue growth of 2.5 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our goal is to continue to grow our Sales per Hub over time, which we believe will drive higher margins and higher return on invested capital. 
 In addition to grocery and convenience stores, we are also expanding in DFD channels such as QSR and club membership to further broaden availability of our doughnuts to consumers. This includes our QSR partnership with McDonald s. Following a successful pilot at approximately 160 McDonald s shops in Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky and the surrounding area, we entered into an agreement to work with McDonald s to develop a deployment schedule for a U.S. national rollout of the sale of Krispy Kreme doughnuts at McDonald s restaurants. The deployment schedule sets forth the anticipated launch period for each McDonald s business unit in the U.S., with phasing expected from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 through the end of fiscal 2026. The rollout commenced at McDonald s restaurants in Chicago in October, with expansion to restaurants in Ohio and Indiana scheduled shortly thereafter. The agreement does not guarantee us any particular level of business unit deployment, sales, or profits. 
 Divestiture of Insomnia Cookies 
 On July 17, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies in exchange for cash proceeds of 120.9 million. On August 1, 2024 we received additional cash of 45.0 million from Insomnia Cookies related to the settlement of an intercompany loan. We have begun to use these proceeds to further strengthen our fresh doughnut business and expand availability, as well as pay down debt. We continue to own 34.7 of Insomnia Cookies and will account for our investment using the equity method. 
 Growing our Global Presence 
 Another key strategic initiative on our journey to become the Most Loved Sweet Treat Brand in the World is to increase our global presence, focusing on the percentage of our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA generated outside the U.S., with a key focus in Europe and select Asian and South American countries. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we opened our first franchise shops in Morocco and we expect to have shop openings in Brazil, Spain, and Germany in the future. We expect to have further announcements throughout the year as we grow our global business.

 Digital, Brand, and Innovation 
 Digital channel sales represented a healthy 15.5 of our Doughnut Shop sales (excluding DFD) for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up 290 basis points from 12.6 in the same quarter last year (excluding Insomnia Cookies from both periods). Our growth in digital is due to our focus on owned channel improvements and increasing product availability through third parties. 
 Innovation is a significant driver of frequency as we create and introduce premium and buzz-worthy offerings to consumers across our Global Points of Access. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024 we delivered the joy that is Krispy Kreme through specialty doughnuts and seasonal activations including Passport to Paris, Barbie, and Pumpkin Spice, among many others around the world. 
 
 Segment Reclassifications 
 As discussed in Note 1 , Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, effective January 1, 2024, we realigned our segment reporting structure such that the Company-owned Canada and Japan businesses have moved from the Market Development reportable operating segment to the International reportable operating segment. All segment information for comparative periods has been restated to be consistent with current presentation.

 Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures 
 We monitor the key business metrics and non-GAAP metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. The calculation of the key business metrics discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors. 
 We utilize Global Points of Access as a key performance indicator. Global Points of Access reflect all locations at which fresh doughnuts can be purchased. Global Points of Access include all Hot Light Theater Shops, Fresh Shops, Carts and Food Trucks, DFD Doors, Cookie Bakeries (through the date of the Insomnia Cookies divestiture), and other defined points at both Company-owned and franchise locations as of the end of the respective reporting period. We monitor Global Points of Access as a metric that informs the growth of our omni-channel presence over time and believe this metric is useful to investors to understand our footprint in each of our segments and by asset type. 
 The following table presents our Global Points of Access, by segment and type, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2023, respectively:

Table of Contents 

 As of September 29, 2024, we had 15,811 Global Points of Access, with 2,032 Krispy Kreme branded shops, 47 Carts and Food Trucks, and 13,732 DFD Doors. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we added a net 35 additional Krispy Kreme branded shops globally, including two Hot Light Theater Shops and 33 Fresh Shops. We added a net 210 new DFD Doors during the quarter as we continue to focus on the deployment of our Hub and Spoke model and our expansion into QSR channels. We plan to continue adding new locations and expanding our digital platform in order to extend the availability of and access to our products. We are excited about our partnership with McDonald s and the phasing of a U.S. national rollout, which we believe has validated the attractiveness of the QSR channel. 
 We also utilize Hubs as a key performance indicator. Our transformation is driven by the implementation of an omni-channel strategy to reach more consumers where they are and drive revenue growth, and this strategy is supported by a capital-efficient Hub and Spoke distribution model that provides a route to market and powers profitability. Our Hot Light Theater Shops and Doughnut Factories serve as centralized production facilities Hubs ). From these Hubs, we deliver doughnuts to our Fresh Shops, Carts and Food Trucks, and DFD Doors Spokes primarily through an integrated network of Company-operated delivery routes, designed to ensure quality and freshness. We are currently exploring an increase in third-party managed delivery to DFD customers in the U.S., an approach we have used in several international markets. Specific to the U.S. segment, certain legacy Hubs have not historically had Spokes. Many Hubs in the U.S. segment are being converted to add Spokes while certain legacy Hubs do not currently have the ability or need to add Spokes. 
 The following table presents our Hubs, by segment and type, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2023, respectively:

 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management evaluates our results of operations using, among other measures, organic revenue growth, Sales per Hub, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA ), Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS as we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are not universally consistent calculations, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Other companies may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently than we do or may not calculate them at all. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our historical Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Organic Revenue Growth 
 Organic revenue growth measures our revenue growth trends excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, and we believe it is useful for investors to understand the expansion of our global footprint through internal efforts. We define organic revenue growth as the growth in revenues, excluding (i) acquired shops owned by us for less than 12 months following their acquisition, (ii) the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, (iii) the impact of shop closures related to restructuring programs such as the shop portfolio optimization program initiated for Krispy Kreme U.S. during fiscal 2022, (iv) the impact of the Branded Sweat Treats business exit, (v) the impact of the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies, and (vi) revenues generated during the 53 rd week for those fiscal years that have a 53 rd week based on our fiscal calendar defined in Note 1 , Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Results of Operations for our organic growth calculations for the periods presented.

 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for share-based compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, and other certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense items. Adjusted EBITDA is a principal metric that management uses to monitor and evaluate operating performance and provides a consistent benchmark for comparison across reporting periods. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income, Diluted as net loss attributable to common shareholders, adjusted for interest expense, share-based compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the tax impact of adjustments, and other certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense items. Adjusted EPS is Adjusted Net Income, Diluted converted to a per share amount. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations, including adjustments for income and expense items that are required by GAAP. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as share-based compensation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments.

 Sales Per Hub 
 In order to measure the effectiveness of our Hub and Spoke model, we use Sales per Hub on a trailing four-quarter basis, which includes all revenue generated from a Hub and its associated Spokes. Sales per Hub equals Fresh Revenues from Hubs with Spokes, divided by the average number of Hubs with Spokes during the period. Fresh Revenues include product sales generated from our Doughnut Shop business (including digital channels), as well as DFD sales, but excluding all Insomnia Cookies revenues as the measure is focused on the Krispy Kreme business. The Average Hub with Spokes for a period is calculated as the average of the number of Hubs with Spokes at the end of the five most recent quarters. The Sales per Hub performance measure allows us and investors to measure our effectiveness at leveraging the Hubs in the Hub and Spoke model to distribute product and generate cost efficiencies and profitability. 
 Sales per Hub was as follows for each of the periods below: 
 Trailing Four Quarters Ended Fiscal Year Ended (in thousands, unless otherwise stated) September 29, 2024 December 31, 2023 January 1, 2023 U.S.: Revenues 1,109,621 1,104,944 1,010,250 Non-Fresh Revenues (1)

 (1) Includes the exited Branded Sweet Treats business revenues as well as licensing royalties from customers for use of the Krispy Kreme brand. 
 (2) Includes Insomnia Cookies revenues (through the date of the divestiture) and Fresh Revenues generated by Hubs without Spokes. 
 (3) Total International net revenues is equal to Fresh Revenues from Hubs with Spokes for that business segment. 
 (4) International Sales per Hub comparative data has been restated in constant currency based on current exchange rates. 
 In our International segment, where the Hub and Spoke model originated, Sales per Hub reached 10.1 million, up from 10.0 million generated in the full fiscal year 2023, and up from 9.7 million generated in the full fiscal year 2022. The International segment illustrates the benefits of leveraging our Hub and Spoke model as the most efficient way to grow the business, as shown by the consistent Sales per Hub and higher Adjusted EBITDA margins despite elevated commodity costs and macroeconomic conditions. In the U.S. segment, we had Sales per Hub of 4.9 million, consistent with the 4.9 million generated in the full fiscal year 2023 and up from 4.5 million generated in the full fiscal year 2022. In the U.S. we continue our efforts to increase the number of quality DFD Doors served by our Hubs as we make progress toward optimizing the segment to look more like our International segment. As we further extend the Hub and Spoke model into existing and new markets around the world, we expect to see our Sales per Hub continue to grow.

 The following table presents a further breakdown of total net revenue and organic revenue growth by segment for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to the quarter ended October 1, 2023: 
 (in thousands, except percentages) U.S. 
 International 
 Market Development 
 Total Company 
 Total net revenues in third quarter of fiscal 2024 228,376 130,697 20,794 379,867 Total net revenues in third quarter of fiscal 2023 
 260,177 126,077 21,113 407,367 Total Net Revenues Growth (31,801) 4,620 (319) (27,500) Total Net Revenues Growth -12.2 3.7 -1.5 -6.8 Less: Impact of Insomnia Cookies divestiture (43,531) (43,531) Adjusted net revenues in third quarter of fiscal 2023 216,646 126,077 21,113 363,836 Adjusted net revenue growth 11,730 4,620 (319) 16,031 Impact of acquisitions (6,228) (1,108) 2,127 (5,209) Impact of foreign currency translation 1,770 1,770 Organic Revenue Growth 5,502 5,282 1,808 12,592 Organic Revenue Growth 2.5 4.2 8.6 3.5 
 Total net revenue declined 27.5 million, or approximately 6.8 , primarily due to the 43.5 million reduction associated with the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies in July 2024, partially offset by 5.2 million from shops acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Organic revenue growth of 12.6 million, or approximately 3.5 , was driven by the continued and successful execution of our omni-channel growth strategy globally, high impact brand activations, and product premiumization efforts. We have continued to increase availability through 2,417, or 18.0 , additional Global Points of Access, primarily including new capital-light DFD Doors, and via digital channels. Additionally, we have continued to take pricing actions to offset cost inflation, with average pricing increasing approximately 4 , partially offset by transaction volume declines from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Our U.S. segment net revenue declined 31.8 million, or approximately 12.2 , primarily due to the 43.5 million reduction associated with the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies in July 2024, partially offset by 6.2 million from shops acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Organic revenue increased 5.5 million, or approximately 2.5 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by Points of Access growth of 969, or 13.7 , compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and growth in Krispy Kreme branded digital channel revenues of 21 . Our organic growth has been supplemented by effective pricing increases with average pricing increasing approximately 4 from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, leading to an increase in the average transaction size, but partially offset by transaction volume declines. 
 Our International segment net revenue grew 4.6 million, or approximately 3.7 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, in spite of foreign currency translation impacts of 1.8 million primarily from a weaker Mexican peso. International organic revenue grew 5.3 million, or approximately 4.2 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven primarily by increased pricing of approximately 4 and Points of Access growth of 1,312, or 31.8 , compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. International organic revenue growth was partially offset by lower transaction volume compared to last year, particularly in the U.K. 
 Our Market Development segment net revenue declined 0.3 million, or approximately 1.5 , due to the 2.1 million impact of franchise acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Market Development organic revenue grew 1.8 million, or approximately 8.6 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 due to the continued expansion of our international franchise business. 
 Product and distribution costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): Product and distribution costs decreased 5.5 million, or 5.4 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, largely in line with and attributable to the same factors as our revenue decline. As a percentage of revenue, product and distribution costs increased by approximately 30 basis points from 24.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 25.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to sales mix shift, increased DFD returns, and impacts from increased discounting.

Table of Contents 

 Operating expenses: Operating expenses decreased 3.4 million, or 1.7 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven mainly by a 21.2 million impact from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies partially offset by increases of 17.8 million in operating expenses for the global Krispy Kreme brand. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by approximately 260 basis points, from 48.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 50.6 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the impact of discounting and lower transaction volumes on operating leverage. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense: Selling, general and administrative SG A expense increased 2.8 million, or 4.1 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, SG A expense increased approximately 190 basis points, from 16.8 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 18.7 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by 11.3 million related to preparing for and executing the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (including share-based compensation expenses), partially offset by cost control initiatives and lower employee cash incentive compensation by 3.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Other income, net: Other income, net of 5.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by a gain of 5.6 million related to the remeasurement of equity method investments to fair value immediately prior to the acquisition of Krispy Kreme shops referenced in Note 2 , Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other income, net of 1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by business interruption insurance recoveries for the Krispy Kreme U.S. business. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 0.6 million, or 2.0 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 40 basis points, from 7.9 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 8.3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by higher capital spend and assets placed into service to support the Hub and Spoke model evolution, including preparing for the acceleration of our U.S. national DFD rollout discussed in Significant Events and Transactions above. 
 Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net increased 3.5 million, or 27.1 , from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase primarily relates to a 3.0 million impact from the maturity of our prior interest rate swap agreements in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We have entered into a cumulative 500.0 million notional new interest rate swap agreements as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which will mature in March 2028. Refer to Note 7 , Derivative Instruments to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Gain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies: In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies in exchange for cash proceeds. Following the transaction, we owned approximately 34.7 of Insomnia Cookies and lost the ability to exercise control. Accordingly, we deconsolidated Insomnia Cookies and recorded a gain on divestiture of 87.1 million. Refer to Note 2 , Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Income tax expense: Income tax expense was 17.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 24.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease of 6.7 million was primarily driven by lower pre-tax results compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, offset by the tax impact of the gain on the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies. 
 Net (loss)/income attributable to noncontrolling interest: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was 2.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, while net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 0.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The fluctuation of 2.2 million was driven by losses allocated to certain consolidated subsidiaries, particularly WKS Krispy Kreme.

 U.S. segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.3 million, or 37.5 , with margin decline of 250 basis points to 6.1 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily driven by a decline in operating leverage, incremental vehicle accident claims costs of 2.8 million, and certain McDonald s start-up costs, partially offset by pricing and productivity benefits from Hub and Spoke expansion. 
 International segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2.2 million, or 8.7 , with margin decline of 240 basis points to 17.4 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, as lower transaction volumes continued to impact operating leverage for the International equity markets. International Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as actions taken to reduce costs delivered improved sequential results. 
 Market Development segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5 million, or 14.8 , with margin expansion of 770 basis points to 54.2 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, driven mainly by savings in SG A and marketing costs, and the continued expansion of our international franchise business.

 Total net revenue growth of 26.2 million, or approximately 2.1 , and organic revenue growth of 72.2 million, or approximately 6.1 , was driven by the continued and successful execution of our growth strategy deploying our omni-channel approach globally. We have continued to increase availability through 2,417 additional Global Points of Access, including 2,483 new capital-light DFD Doors, and via digital channels . Additionally, we have continued to take pricing actions to offset cost inflation, with average pricing increasing approximately 6 , partially offset by transaction volume declines from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. 
 Our U.S. segment net revenue grew 4.7 million, or approximately 0.6 , and organic revenue increased 48.3 million, or approximately 6.4 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. G rowth was driven primarily by 969 additional Points of Access compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 and growth in Krispy Kreme branded digital channel revenues of 26 . Our organic growth has been supplemented by effective pricing increases with average pricing increasing approximately 7 from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, leading to an increase in the average transaction size, but partially offset by transaction volume declines. 
 O ur International segment ne t revenue grew 22.1 million, or approximately 6.2 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, in spite of foreign currency translation i mpacts of 1.3 million . International organic rev enue grew 22.3 million , or approximately 6.2 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, driven primarily by increased pricing of approximately 5 and Points of Access growth of 1,312 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. International organic revenue growth was partially offset by the lower transaction volume compared to last year. 
 Our Market Development segment net revenue declined 0.6 million, or approximately 0.8 , due to the 2.1 million impact of acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Market Development organic revenue grew 1.6 million , or approximately 2.3 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 due to the continued expansion of our international franchise business. 
 Product and distribution costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): Product and distribution costs decreased 19.6 million, or 5.9 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, product and distribution c osts decreased by approximately 210 basis points from 26.7 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 24.6 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, primarily due to benefits from pricing actions taken to offset materials cost inflation of approximately 4 . Additionally, we benefited from the exit of the lower-margin Branded Sweet Treats business, and lapping the related 10.4 million inventory write-offs and employee severance expenses incurred during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023.

Table of Contents 

 Operating expenses: Operating expenses increased 33.8 million, or 5.9 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, driven mainly by labor cost inflation of approximately 5 and investments to support growth, with shop and delivery labor expenses increasing 20.8 million. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 170 basis points, from 46.6 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 48.3 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the impact of lower transaction volumes on operating leverage. This has been partially offset by efficiency benefits from Hub and Spoke expansion. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense: SG A expense increased 14.8 million, or 7.7 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, SG A expense increased approximately 80 basis points, from 15.6 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 16.4 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by 14.2 million related to preparing for and executing the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (including share-based compensation expenses), partially offset by lower employee cash incentive compensation by 7.6 million and cost control initiatives in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. 
 Other income, net: Other income, net of 6.4 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 was driven by a gain of 5.6 million related to the remeasurement of equity method investments to fair value immediately prior to the acquisition of Krispy Kreme shops referenced in Note 2 , Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other income, net of 6.1 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by a gain on a sale-leaseback transaction of 9.6 million, partially offset by property, plant and equipment impairments associated with the exit of the Branded Sweet Treats business. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense: Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10.4 million, or 11.7 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 70 basis points, from 7.2 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 7.9 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by higher capital spend and assets placed into service to support the Hub and Spoke model evolution, including preparing for the acceleration of our U.S. national DFD rollout discussed in Significant Events and Transactions above. 
 Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net increased 7.6 million, or 20.6 , from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily driven by a higher average debt balance in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and also includes a 3.0 million impact from the maturity of our prior interest rate swap agreements in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We have entered into a cumulative 500.0 million notional new interest rate swap agreements as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which will mature in March 2028. 
 Gain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies: In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies in exchange for cash proceeds. Following the transaction, we owned approximately 34.7 of Insomnia Cookies and lost the ability to exercise control. Accordingly, we deconsolidated Insomnia Cookies and recorded a gain on divestiture of 87.1 million. Refer to Note 2 , Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Income tax expense: Income tax expense was 18.3 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, while income tax expense was 17.1 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The fluctuation of 1.2 million from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower pre-tax results compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, offset by the tax impact of the gain on the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies.

 U.S. segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.3 million, or 0.4 , with margin flat at 11.0 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, as benefits from lapping the exited Branded Sweet Treats business, productivity benefits from Hub and Spoke expansion, and lower employee cash incentive compensation were offset by impacts from lower transaction volume on operating leverage and incremental vehicle accident claims costs. 
 International segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.7 million, or 5.4 , with margin decline of 200 basis points to 17.1 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, as lower transaction volume continued to impact operating leverage for the International equity markets. 
 Market Development segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.2 million, or 13.1 , with margin expansion of 670 basis points to 53.8 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, driven mainly by savings in SG A and the continued expansion of our international franchise business.

 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity to date have included cash from operating activities, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit facility, vendor financing including our SCF programs and structured payables programs, and proceeds from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies. Our primary use of liquidity is to fund the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other commitments. 
 Our future obligations primarily consist of our debt and lease obligations, as well as commitments under ingredient and other forward purchase contracts. As of December 31, 2023, we had the following future obligations: 
 An aggregate principal amount of 837.5 million outstanding under the 2023 Facility; 
 An aggregate principal amount of 11.0 million outstanding under short-term, uncommitted lines of credit; 
 Non-cancellable future minimum operating lease payments totaling 759.2 million; 
 Non-cancellable future minimum finance lease payments totaling 63.3 million; and 
 Purchase commitments under ingredient and other forward purchase contracts of 130.5 million. 
 As of September 29, 2024, the principal amount outstanding under our 2023 Facility was 798.8 million. The decrease from the 2023 Facility balance as of December 31, 2023 was driven by our use of a portion of the proceeds from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies to pay down outstanding balances associated with the 2023 Facility. Refer to Note 9 , Long-Term Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 25.4 million and 38.2 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations could vary because of, and our future capital requirements will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending on business acquisitions, the growth of our presence in new markets, and the expansion of our omni-channel model in existing markets. We may enter into arrangements in the future to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.

 Cash Flows 
 We typically generate cash from operations and have substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures and debt repayments. Our requirement for working capital is not significant because our consumers pay us in cash or on debit or credit cards at the time of the sale and we are able to sell many of our inventory items before payment is due to the vendor of such items. The following table and discussion present, for the periods indicated, a summary of our key cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities: 
 Three Quarters Ended (in thousands) 
 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 18,787 44,032 Net cash provided by/(used for) investing activities 44,745 (78,358) Net cash (used for)/provided by financing activities (77,348) 27,533 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operations totaled 18.8 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, a decrease of 25.2 million compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily due to less operating income generated in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, as well as our receipt of 7.7 million cash proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swap derivative contracts in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 discussed in Note 7 , Derivative Instruments to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities totaled 44.7 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, a fluctuation of 123.1 million compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of 117.6 million from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies and an additional 45.0 million from the repayment of an intercompany loan due from Insomnia Cookies in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. These proceeds were partially offset by our use of 26.6 million cash for the acquisition of franchised shops in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, discussed in Note 2 , Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We expect to incur additional capital expenditures related to our accelerated U.S. expansion, including via QSR channels such as the McDonald s U.S. national rollout discussed in Significant Events and Transactions above. We plan to support much of this expansion using existing capacity, and do not expect a significant increase in capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2024. While we do expect U.S. capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues to increase in fiscal 2025 and 2026 associated with acceleration of the overall U.S. business expansion, these capital expenditures support the overall DFD and retail channels and are not directly attributable to, or required by, the agreement with McDonald s. We are not subject to capital expenditure commitments or obligations specific to the relationship with McDonald s. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used for financing activities totaled 77.3 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, a fluctuation of 104.9 million compared with the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by the pay down of long term debt balances with a portion of the net proceeds received from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies. 
 Proceeds from our structured payables resulted in a net 48.7 million change in cash flows (net proceeds from structured payables of 34.2 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to net payments on structured payables of 14.5 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023). The proceeds from structured payables in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 primarily related to our purchase of all shares held by the noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated subsidiary Awesome Doughnut. Refer to Note 8 , Vendor Finance Programs to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.

 Debt 
 Our long-term debt obligations consist of the following: 
 (in thousands) 
 September 29, 2024 December 31, 2023 2023 Facility term loan 656,250 682,500 2023 Facility revolving credit facility 142,500 155,000 Short-term lines of credit 2,500 11,000 Less: Debt issuance costs (3,584) (4,371) Finance lease obligations 54,549 47,117 Total long-term debt 852,215 891,246 Less: Current portion of long-term debt (47,577) (54,631) Long-term debt, less current portion 804,638 836,615 
 2023 Secured Credit Facility 
 The 2023 Facility consists of a 300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a term loan with an original principal amount of 700.0 million. Refer to Note 9 , Long-Term Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Under the terms of the 2023 Facility, we are subject to a requirement to maintain a leverage ratio of less than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each quarterly Test Period (as defined in the 2023 Facility) through maturity in March 2028. The leverage ratio under the 2023 Facility is defined as the ratio of (a) Total Indebtedness (as defined in the 2023 Facility, which includes all debt and finance lease obligations) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to (b) a defined calculation of Adjusted EBITDA (2023 Facility Adjusted EBITDA) for the most recently ended Test Period. Our leverage ratio was 3.51 to 1.00 as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 3.48 to 1.00 as of the end of fiscal 2023. 
 We were in compliance with the financial covenants related to the 2023 Facility as of September 29, 2024 and expect to remain in compliance over the next 12 months. If we are unable to meet the 2023 Facility financial or other covenants in future periods, it may negatively impact our liquidity by limiting our ability to draw on the revolving credit facility, could result in the lenders accelerating the maturity of such indebtedness and foreclosing upon the collateral pledged thereunder, and could require the replacement of the 2023 Facility with new sources of financing, which there is no guaranty we could secure. 
 Short-Term Lines of Credit 
 We are party to two agreements with existing lenders providing for short-term, uncommitted lines of credit up to 25.0 million. Borrowings under these short-term lines of credit are payable to the lenders on a revolving basis for tenors up to a maximum of three months and are subject to an interest rate of adjusted term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 plus a margin of 1.75 . 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as related disclosures. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate, or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates, and assumptions could have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from the estimates made by management. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Effects of Changing Prices Inflation 
 We are exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations in the cost of ingredients of our products, of which flour, sugar, and shortening are the most significant. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we have continued to experience headwinds from commodity inflation globally. We have undertaken efforts to effectively manage inflationary cost increases through rapid inventory turnover and reduced inventory waste, increased focus on resiliency of our supply chains, and an ability to adjust pricing of our products. Additionally, from time to time we may enter into forward contracts for supply through our vendors for raw materials which are ingredients of our products or which are components of such ingredients, including wheat, sugar, and soybean oil. 
 We are also exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations in the cost of gasoline used by our delivery vehicles. To mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price of our fuel purchases, we may directly purchase commodity futures contracts. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates on any borrowings under our debt facilities, which bear interest based on the one-month SOFR (with a floor of zero). Generally, interest rate changes could impact the amount of our interest paid and, therefore, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. To mitigate the impact of changes in SOFR on interest expense for a portion of our variable rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swaps on 500.0 million notional of our 801.3 million of outstanding debt under the 2023 Facility and short-term lines of credit as of September 29, 2024, which we account for as cash flow hedges. The interest rate swap agreements are scheduled to mature in March 2028. Based on the 301.3 million of unhedged outstanding as of September 29, 2024, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the one-month SOFR would result in a 3.0 million increase or decrease, respectively, in interest expense for a 12-month period, based on the daily average of the one-month SOFR for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency translation risk on the operations of our subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, whose revenues accounted for approximately 30 of our total net revenues through the three quarters ended September 29, 2024. A substantial majority of these revenues, or approximately 380.7 million through the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, were attributable to subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Mexican peso, and the Japanese yen. A 10 increase or decrease in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Mexican peso, and the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a decrease or increase of approximately 38.1 million in our total net revenues for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024. 
 From time to time, we engage in foreign currency exchange and credit transactions with our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which we typically hedge. To date, the impact of such transactions, including the cost of hedging, has not been material. We do not engage in foreign currency or hedging transactions for speculative purposes. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we completed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 There were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
