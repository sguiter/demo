Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain
statements that we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. These statements,
among other things, relate to our business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our future operations, prospects, plans and objectives
of management. The words anticipate , believe , continue , could , estimate ,
 expect , intend , may , plan , predict , project , will ,
and similar terms and phrases are used to identify forward-looking statements in this presentation. 

Our
operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could
materially affect our results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. We have based
these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may
affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives,
and financial needs. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements reflecting management s
expectations for future financial performance and operating expenditures (including our ability to continue as a going concern, to raise
additional capital and to succeed in our future operations), expected growth, profitability and business outlook and increased operating
expenses. 

Forward-looking
statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our
actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements.
These factors include, among other things, the unknown risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from
these forward looking statements as set forth under the heading, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us
to predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation,
risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to: 

reverse the recent decline
 in our revenue and resume growing our revenue; 

resolve the various litigation
 proceedings pending against us on favorable terms or at all; 

obtain additional financing
 in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms so that we can fund our business plan; 

reduce our dependence on
 third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on our contracts; 

mitigate the impact of
 new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business; 

mitigate the impact of
 the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues; 

adopt and master new technologies
 and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry s and customers evolving demands; and 

mitigate the impact of
 changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including
 those resulting from natural or man-made disasters. 

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. In light of inherent risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future
events and trends discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated
or implied in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we are under no duty to update or revise any of such forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Form 10-Q. 

You
should read this Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances
may be materially different from what we expect. 

All
references to SCWorx, we, us, our or the Company mean SCWorx Corp.,
a Delaware corporation, and where appropriate, its wholly owned subsidiaries.

. To facilitate the
planned acquisition by Alliance MMA, Inc., a Delaware corporation Alliance ), on June 27, 2018, SCW LLC merged with and
into a newly-formed entity, SCWorx Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation SCW Acquisition ), with SCW Acquisition being
the surviving entity. Subsequently, on August 17, 2018, SCW Acquisition changed its name to SCWorx Corp. On November 30, 2018, the Company
and certain of its stockholders agreed to cancel shares of common stock. In June 2018, the Company began to collect subscriptions
for common stock. From June to November 2018, the Company collected in subscriptions and issued shares of common stock
to new third-party investors. In addition, on February 1, 2019, (i) SCWorx Corp. (f/k/a SCWorx Acquisition Corp.) changed its name to
SCW FL Corp. (to allow Alliance to change its name to SCWorx Corp.) and (ii) Alliance acquired SCWorx Corp. (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) in a
stock-for-stock exchange transaction and changed Alliance s name to SCWorx Corp., which is the Company s current name, with
SCW FL Corp. becoming the Company s subsidiary. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCWorx established a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Direct-Worx, LLC to endeavor to source and provide critical, difficult-to-find items for the healthcare industry which it
has since ceased. 

On
October 6, 2023, following stockholder approval at the Company s annual meeting, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation
to implement a reverse split of its common stock. The reverse stock split was effective at the opening of the trading day on October
11, 2023. 

The
effects of the reverse stock split have been reflected in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for all periods presented. 

On
October 16, 2023, the Company entered into a letter of intent to merge with American Energy Partners, Inc. American Environmental and subsequently entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement on December 22, 2023. The
Merger Agreement was mutually terminated on March 26, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, American Environmental contributed
an aggregate to the Company to assist in covering its operating expenses.

for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and
 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accumulated deficit as of March 31, 2024 was . The Company has not yet
achieved profitability and expects to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that its operating losses will
continue and, as a result, the Company will eventually need to generate significant increases in product revenues to achieve profitability.
These conditions indicate that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the financial statement issuance date. 

As
of the filing date of this Report, the Company has only limited cash on hand, and management believes that there may not be sufficient
capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements in order to meet operating expenses and working capital requirements
for the next twelve months. 

Accordingly, the Company is
evaluating various alternatives, including reducing operating expenses, securing additional financing through debt or equity securities
to fund future business activities and other strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate
the level of operating revenues in its business plan, or if additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms, if
at all. If no additional sources of financing are available, our future operating prospects may be adversely affected. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

. The Company did not have amounts in excess of the FDIC insured limit as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES ACT ). The funds were received from Bank of America through
a loan agreement pursuant to the CARES Act. The CARES Act was established in order to enable small businesses to pay employees during
the economic slowdown caused by COVID-19 by providing forgivable loans to qualifying businesses for up to 2.5 times their average monthly
payroll costs. The amount borrowed under the CARES Act and used for payroll costs, rent, mortgage interest, and utility costs during the
24 week period after the date of loan disbursement is eligible to be forgiven provided that (a) the Company uses the PPP Funds during
the eight week period after receipt thereof, and (b) the PPP Funds are only used to cover payroll costs (including benefits), rent, mortgage
interest, and utility costs. While the full loan amount may be forgiven, the amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if, among other
reasons, the Company does not maintain staffing or payroll levels or less than of the loan proceeds are used for payroll costs. Principal
and interest payments on any unforgiven portion of the PPP Funds (the PPP Loan will be deferred to the date the SBA remits

space in New York, New York under a similar month-to-month arrangement. 

The Company has operating
leases for corporate, business and technician offices. Leases with a probable term of 12 months or less, including month-to-month agreements,
are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, unless the arrangement includes an option to purchase the underlying asset,
or an option to renew the arrangement, that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (short-term leases). The Company recognizes
lease expense for these leases on a straight-line bases over the lease term. The Company s only remaining lease is month-to-month.
As a practical expedient, the Company elected, for all office and facility leases, not to separate non-lease components (common-area maintenance
costs) from lease components (fixed payments including rent) and instead to account for each separate lease component and its associated
non-lease components as a single lease component.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Company s operations
and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread throughout
the United States and the world. The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations
of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak. 

In addition, the Company s
customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented
demand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company s customers 
business, the Company s customers were focused on meeting the nation s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources on expanding the utilization of the Company s
services, which has adversely impacted the Company s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic subside.
In addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due
to the Company for services, which could negatively impact the Company s cash flows.

Revenues 

Revenue for the three months
ended March 31, 2024 was 812,099 as compared to 997,449 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to
the expiration and non-renewal of certain customer contracts. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues was 603,465
for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 689,462 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of staffing
reductions. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses decreased
 320,314 to 387,090 for the three months March 31, 2024, as compared to 707,404 in the same period of 2023. The decrease is primarily
attributable to decreases in legal and professional fees of approximately 128,000, salaries and wages of 18,000, and stock-based compensation
of 148,000. We expect operating expenses to remain relatively flat during the rest of 2024. 

Other income (expense) 

We had other expenses of 203
and 473 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, comprised of interest expense. 

Net Loss 

For the three months ended
March 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 178,659 compared to a net loss of 399,890 for the same period in 2023 due to the factors detailed
above.

Operating Activities 

Cash used in operating activities
was approximately 59,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly related to the net loss of approximately 180,000, a 86,000
increase in accounts receivable and a 31,000 increase in prepaid expenses, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of 174,000 and deferred revenue of 32,000. 

Cash provided by operating
activities was approximately 19,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, mainly related to the net loss of approximately 400,000,
and a 21,000 increase in prepaid expenses, partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of 148,000, an increase in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities of 145,000 and an increase in deferred revenue of 155,000. 

Investing Activities 

The Company did not have any
investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

21 

Financing Activities 

Cash provided by financing
activities was 7,647 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, consisting of proceeds from accounts payable and accrued liabilities
- related party of approximately 123,000 partially offset by repayments on these accounts payable and accrued liabilities - related party
of approximately 96,000 and repayments of loans payable of 19,000. 

Cash used in financing activities
was 19,090 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, consisting of net repayments on loans payable. 

Management has concluded that
on our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern since we may not have sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements
to meet our operating expenses and working capital requirements. We have historically incurred operating losses and may continue to incur
operating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. This may hinder our future ability to obtain financing or may force us to obtain financing on less favorable terms than
would otherwise be available. If we are unable to develop sufficient revenues and additional customers for our products and services,
we may not generate enough revenue to sustain our business, and we may fail, in which case our stockholders would suffer a total loss
of their investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, as required by Rules
13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based on the 2013 framework and criteria established
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system
of Disclosure Controls. Accordingly, even effective Disclosure Controls can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control
objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, due to deficiencies in the design
of internal controls and lack of segregation of duties, our Disclosure Controls were not effective as of March 31, 2024, such that
the Disclosure Controls did not ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is
(i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

During the quarter ended March
31, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

22 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

In conducting our business,
we may become involved in legal proceedings. We will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in
the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in
the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside
legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.

is authorized to determine or alter the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions granted
to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and within the limitations or restrictions stated in any resolution
or resolutions of the Board of Directors adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the total number of Directors
then in office, originally fixing the number of shares constituting any series of Preferred Stock to increase or decrease (but
not below the number of shares of any such series of Preferred Stock, then outstanding) the number of shares of any such series
of Preferred Stock and to fix the number of shares of any series of Preferred Stock. In the event that the number of shares of
any series of Preferred Stock shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status which such shares
had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series of Preferred Stock subject to
the requirements of applicable law. The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of each
series of Preferred Stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions granted to or imposed upon, any such series of
Preferred Stock may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside the resolutions or resolutions providing for the issue of
such Preferred Stock, adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the total number of Directors then in office, provided
that the manner in which such facts shall operate upon the powers, preferences and rights of, and the qualifications, limitations
and restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Any of the powers,
preferences and rights of, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions granted to or imposed upon, such series of Preferred
Stock is clearly and expressly set forth in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such series of Preferred Stock
adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the total number of Directors then in office. 

5. Preemptive
Rights. Other than pursuant to a written agreement between the Corporation and a holder of Preferred Stock, no holder of Preferred
Stock shall have any preemptive rights with respect to the Common Stock or any other securities of the Corporation, or to any obligations
convertible (directly or indirectly) into securities of the Corporation, whether now or hereafter authorized. 

FIFTH:
 Subject to any additional vote required by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, in furtherance and not in limitation
of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind any
or all of the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

SIXTH:
 Subject to any additional vote required by the Certificate of Incorporation, the number of directors of the Corporation
shall be determined in the manner set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

Article Ninth to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability
of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law
as so amended. 

Any repeal
or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Ninth by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability of any director of

entitled to be indemnified under this Article Tenth or otherwise. 

3. Claims
by Directors and Officers. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article Tenth is not paid in

joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorney s fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with such Proceeding. The ultimate determination of entitlement to indemnification of persons who are non-director or officer employees
or agents shall be made in such manner as is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such person

limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or other enterprise. 

8. Insurance. The
Board of Directors may, to the full extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be
amended from time to time, authorize an appropriate officer or officers to purchase and maintain at the Corporation s expense
insurance: (a) to indemnify the Corporation for any obligation
which it incurs as a result of the indemnification of directors, officers and employees under the provisions of this Article
Tenth; and (b) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and employees against liability in instances in which they may not
otherwise be indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this Article Tenth. 

9. Amendment
or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Tenth shall not adversely affect any right
or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
The rights provided hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such person s heirs, executors and
administrators. 

4

 The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any interest or expectancy of the Corporation in,
or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity. An

any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within
ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. If any
provision or provisions of this Article Twelfth shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person
or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability
of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article Twelfth (including, without limitation,
each portion of any sentence of this Article Twelfth containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or entities
and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

regard to any limitations on conversion) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and distributions.

4. Conversion. 
Provided shareholders having the requisite number of shares of the Company s Common Stock have approved the Purchase Agreement
and all transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Preferred Shares and shares issuable upon exercise of
the Warrant issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and further provided that Nasdaq has issued an approval letter with respect
to the Purchase Agreement and the issuance of the Preferred Shares and shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants being issued
pursuant to the Warrants, each Preferred Share shall be convertible into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock (as defined below) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4 (collectively, the Approvals ). 

(a) Holder s
Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(e), at any time or times on or after the Approvals, each Holder shall
be entitled to convert any whole number of Preferred Shares into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). 

(b) Conversion

Preferred Share pursuant to Section 4(a) shall be determined according to the following formula (the Conversion Rate ): 

Base Amount 

 Conversion Price 

No fractional
shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares. If the issuance would result in the issuance
of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole
share. 

(c) Mechanics
of Conversion. The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner: 

(i) Holder s
Conversion. To convert a Preferred Share into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock on any date
(a Conversion Date ), a Holder shall deliver (whether via email or otherwise), for receipt on or prior to 11:59
p.m., New York time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion of the share(s) of Preferred Shares subject to such
conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the Conversion Notice to the Company. If
required by Section 4(c)(vi), within five (5) Trading Days following a conversion of any such Preferred Shares as aforesaid, such
Holder shall surrender to a nationally recognized overnight delivery service for delivery to the Company the original certificates
representing the share(s) of Preferred Shares (the Preferred Share Certificates so converted as aforesaid. 

16 

(ii) Company s
Response. On or before the first (1st) Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall
transmit by email an acknowledgment of confirmation, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit II, of receipt of such
Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer Agent
to process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms herein. On or before the second (2 nd Trading
Day following the date of receipt by the Company of such Conversion Notice, the Company shall (I) provided that the Transfer Agent
is participating in DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which
such Holder shall be entitled to such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian
system, or (2) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver
(via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name
of such Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled. If the number
of Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion pursuant to Section 4(c)(vi) is
greater than the number of Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall if requested by such Holder, as soon as practicable
and in no event later than three (3) Trading Days after receipt of the Preferred Share Certificate(s) and at its own expense, issue
and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a new Preferred Share Certificate representing the number of Preferred Shares not
converted. 

(iii) Record
Holder. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. 

17 

(iv) Company s
Failure to Timely Convert. If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, to issue to a Holder within two (2)
Trading Days after the Company s receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via email or otherwise) (the Share Delivery Deadline ),
a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled and register such shares of Common Stock
on the Company s share register or to credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for such number of shares
of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion of any Preferred Shares (as the case may be) (a
 Conversion Failure ), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, such Holder, upon written
notice to the Company, may void its Conversion Notice with respect to, and retain or have returned (as the case may be) any Preferred
Shares that have not been converted pursuant to such Holder s Conversion Notice, provided that the voiding of a Conversion Notice
shall not affect the Company s obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to
the terms of this Certificate of Designations or otherwise and (y) the Company shall pay in cash to such Holder on each day after
such third (3 rd Trading Day that the issuance of such shares of Common Stock is not timely effected an amount equal
to 1.5 of the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock not issued to such Holder on a timely basis and to
which the Holder is entitled and (B) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the last
possible date on which the Company could have issued such shares of Common Stock to the Holder without violating Section 4(c).
In addition to the foregoing, if within two (2) Trading Days after the Company s receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via email
or otherwise), the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to such Holder and register such shares of Common Stock
on the Company s share register or credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case may be), and if on or after
such second (2nd) Trading Day such Holder (or any other Person in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) purchases (in an open
market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of all or any portion
of the number of shares of Common Stock, or a sale of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to all or any portion of the number
of shares of Common Stock, issuable upon such conversion that such Holder so anticipated receiving from the Company, then, in addition
to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days after such Holder s request and
in such Holder s discretion, either (i) pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holder s total purchase price (including
brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (including, without
limitation, by any other Person in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) (the Buy-In Price ), at which point
the Company s obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate or credit such Holder s balance account with DTC for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case may be) (and to
issue such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to so issue and deliver to such Holder
a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit such Holder s balance account with DTC for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case may be)
and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of
shares of Common Stock multiplied by (B) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period
commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending on the date of such issuance and payment under this clause 

18 

(v) Pro
Rata Conversion: Disputes. In the event the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same Conversion
Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert
from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative
to the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 22. 

(vi) Book-Entry. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4, upon conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with
the terms hereof, no Holder thereof shall be required to physically surrender the certificate representing the Preferred Shares
to the Company following conversion thereof unless (A) the full or remaining number of Preferred Shares represented by the certificate
are being converted (in which event such certificate(s) shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(vi))
or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting
reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of any Preferred Shares. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records
showing the number of Preferred Shares so converted by such Holder and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method,
reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of the certificate representing
the Preferred Shares upon each such conversion. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge
and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred
Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each certificate
for Preferred Shares shall bear the following legend: 

ANY TRANSFEREE
OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO
THE SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(vi) THEREOF. THE NUMBER OF SHARES
OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK STATED
ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(vi) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED
STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 

19 

(d) Taxes. 
The Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp, transfer (but only in respect of the registered holder thereof), issuance
and other similar taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion
of Preferred Shares. 

(e) Limitation
on Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Designations, the Preferred
Shares held by a Holder shall not be convertible by such Holder, and the Company shall not effect any conversion of any Preferred
Shares held by such Holder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially
own in excess of 4.99 (the Maximum Percentage of the Common Stock. To the extent the above limitation applies,
the determination of whether the Preferred Shares held by such Holder shall be convertible (vis-a-vis other convertible, exercisable
or exchangeable securities owned by such Holder or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall be convertible, exercisable
or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by such Holder and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage
limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case
may be). No prior inability of a Holder to convert Preferred Shares, or of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock to such
Holder, pursuant to this Section 4(e) shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section 4(e) with respect
to any subsequent determination of convertibility or issuance (as the case may be). For purposes of this Section 4(e), beneficial
ownership and all determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage ownership)
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The
provisions of this Section 4(e) shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section
4(e) to correct this Section 4(e) (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum Percentage
beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect
to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section 4(e) shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred
Shares. The holders of Common Stock shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 4(e) and the Company may not waive this
Section 4(e). For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two (2) Business
Days confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, including by virtue of
any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation, pursuant
to this Certificate of Designations or securities issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. By written notice to the Company,
any Holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99 specified in such notice;
provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and
(ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to such Holder sending such notice and not to any other Holder. 

20 

(f) Mandatory
conversion. If the 20-day VWAP is greater than one hundred thirty percent (130 of the Conversion Price, for twenty consecutive
trading days and there is an effective registration statement registering the Conversion Shares Mandatory Conversion Date ),
all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert to Common Stock (a Mandatory Conversion ).
However, to the extent that such Mandatory Conversion would result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder
shall not be required to participate in such Mandatory Conversion to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common
Stock as a result of such Mandatory Conversion to such extent) and such Mandatory Conversion to such extent shall be held in abeyance
for such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage
and at such time such shares will automatically convert to Common Stock in one or more series of issuances. Within two Business
Days of the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver to each Holder the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion
of such Holder s Series A Preferred Stock, and, within two Business Days after receipt of such Conversion Shares, each Holder shall
return the certificates for its Series A Preferred Stock to the Company, provided that, any failure by the Holder to return a certificate
for Series A Preferred Stock will have no effect on the Mandatory Conversion pursuant to this Section, which Mandatory Conversion
will be deemed to occur on the Mandatory Conversion Date. 

5. Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events. 

(a) Purchase
Rights. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) below, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any
Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all of the record
holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon
the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder
had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without taking into
account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares) held by such Holder immediately before the
date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date
as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided,
however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder exceeding
the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial
ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent
shall be held in abeyance for such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding
the Maximum Percentage). 

21 

(b) Other
Corporate Events. In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental
Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect
to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision
to insure that each Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred Shares held by such
Holder (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which
such Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such
Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility
of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise
receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection
with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares
of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. The provisions of this Section
5(b) shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on
the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations. 

6. Rights
Upon Fundamental Transactions. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and
be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designations
and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may
exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of
Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company
herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver
to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at any time after the consummation
of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property (except
such items still issuable under Sections 5 and 11, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the conversion
of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity)
or other consideration which each Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction
had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard
to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations), as adjusted in accordance
with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to
successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares. 

22 

7. Certain Adjustments. 

(a) Issuance
of Lower Priced Securities. If, at any time while the Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Company or any subsidiary, as applicable,
sells or grants any option to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues (or announces
any sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition), any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents (other than shares
of Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with the Company s stock option plan, shares underlying currently outstanding securities
(or shares/rights to acquire shares issued in settlement of existing indebtedness, provided that the number of shares of Common
Stock issued to satisfy such indebtedness, shall not exceed 750,000 shares), entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock
at an effective price per share that is lower than the then Conversion Price (such lower price, the Base Exercise Price ),
then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal at all times the lower of the Base Exercise Price or the Conversion Price as
set forth above. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents are issued (each a Dilutive
Issuance ). If the Company enters into a variable rate transaction, the Company shall be deemed to have issued Common Stock
or Common Stock equivalents at the lowest possible conversion price at which such securities may be converted or exercised. The
Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than three (3) Trading Days following the issuance of any Common Stock or
Common Stock equivalents subject to this Section), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price,
exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the Dilutive Issuance Notice ). For purposes
of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section, upon the occurrence
of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Common Shares based upon the Base Conversion Price on or
after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Conversion Price in the
Notice of Conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing in no event shall the Conversion Price be reduced to an amount less than 20 
of closing bid price of Common Stock on the Trading Day prior to initial closing. 

(b) Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Sections 5 and
11 , if the Company at any time on or after the Initial Issuance Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization
or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision of Sections 5
 and 11 , if the Company at any time on or after the Initial Issuance Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split
or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(b)
shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment
under this Section 7(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such
Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c) Other
Events. In the event that the Company (or any Subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not
strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect any Holder from dilution or if any event occurs of the
type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without
limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the
Board shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the
rights of such Holder, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 7 will increase the Conversion Price as
otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7, provided further that if such Holder
does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then the Board and
such Holder shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate
adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by the Company. 

23 

(d) Calculations. 
All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made by rounding to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a cent or the nearest
1/100 th of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include
shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue
or sale of Common Stock. 

8. Authorized Shares. 

(a) Reservation. 
The Company shall, following receipt of the Approvals, initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to 200 of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Base Amount of each Preferred Share as of the
Initial Issuance Date (assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
have been issued, such Preferred Shares are convertible at the Conversion Price and without taking into account any limitations
on the conversion of such Preferred Shares set forth in herein) issuable pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations
from the Initial Issuance Date through the second anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date (assuming for purposes hereof, that
all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement have been issued and without taking into account any limitations
on the issuance of securities set forth herein). So long as any of the Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Company shall, following
receipt of the Approvals, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of
Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares, as of any given date, 200 of the number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Preferred Shares issued
or issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement have been issued and without taking into account any limitations on the issuance of securities set forth
herein), provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so available be less than the number of shares required
to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions contained in this Certificate of Designations)
(the Required Amount ). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Preferred
Shares and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number
of Preferred Shares held by each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares (as the case
may be) (the Authorized Share Allocation ). In the event a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such
Holder s Preferred Shares, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation.
Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to
the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares, pro rata based on the number of Preferred Shares then held by such Holders. 

24 

(b) Insufficient
Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 8(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time, following receipt of the Approvals,
while any of the Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares
of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to have available for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall
promptly take all action necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow
the Company to reserve and have available the Required Amount for all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure,
but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting
of its stockholders or conduct a consent solicitation for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common
Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its
Board to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 8 shall limit any obligations
of the Company under any provision of the Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing shares of
Common Stock upon a conversion of any Preferred Share due to the failure by the Company to have sufficient shares of Common Stock

Failure Shares ), in lieu of delivering such Authorization Failure Shares to such Holder of such Preferred Shares, the
Company shall pay cash in exchange for the cancellation of such Preferred Shares convertible into such Authorized Failure Shares
at a price equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) such number of Authorization Failure Shares and (y) the Closing Sale Price
on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date such Holder delivers the applicable Conversion Notice with respect to such Authorization
Failure Shares to the Company and (ii) to the extent such Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares

and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any, of such Holder incurred in connection therewith.

not in excess of the conversion limitations set forth in Section 4(e) herein. Except as otherwise required by law, the holders

10. Optional and Triggered Redemption 

(a) Company
Redemption. At any time commencing at the earlier of (i) six months after the Initial Issuance Date, or (ii) upon registration
for resale of the Conversion Shares under the Securities Act, and provided that no Equity Conditions Failure (as defined below)
exists, the Company shall have the right to redeem all or part of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the Company Redemption
Amount ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption described herein shall be redeemed by the Company, in cash at a price
per Preferred Share (the Company Redemption Price equal to one hundred and twenty percent (120 of the Stated
Value. The Company may exercise its redemption option under this Section 10(a) by delivering a written notice thereof by facsimile
or electronic mail to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company Redemption Notice and the date
all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Redemption Notice Date ). The Company Redemption
Notice shall be irrevocable. The Company Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Redemption shall occur
(the Company Redemption Date which date shall not be less than fifteen (15) Trading Days nor more than twenty-five
(25) Trading Days following the Company Redemption Notice Date, (y) certify that there has been no Equity Conditions Failure and
(z) state the aggregate Company Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such Company Optional Redemption
from such Holder and all of the other Holders of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section 10(a) on the Company Optional Redemption
Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if no Equity Conditions Failure has occurred as of the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date but an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Company Redemption Date, (A) the Company
shall provide each Holder a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such Holder waives the Equity Conditions Failure, the
Company Redemption with respect to such Holder shall be cancelled and the applicable Company Redemption Notice shall be null and
void and (ii) at any time prior to the date the Company Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Redemption Amount may be
converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts converted
by a Holder after the Company Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the Company Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares of such
Holder required to be redeemed on the Company Redemption Date. In the event of the Company s redemption of any of the Preferred
Shares under this Section 10(a), a Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability
to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such
Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium due under this Section 10(a) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed,
a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company shall have no right to effect a Company Redemption if any Triggering Event has occurred and is continuing, but any
Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. Equity Conditions
Failure means that that on the date specified, the Equity Conditions are not met in whole or in part.

(i) Triggering
Event. Each of the following events shall constitute a Triggering Event :

b. the
Company s shareholders do not approve the Transaction Documents on or before January 31, 2019, subject to extension for up to 30

(ii) Notice
of a Triggering Event: Redemption Right. Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event with respect to the Preferred Shares, the
Company shall within one (1) Business Day deliver written notice thereof via facsimile or electronic mail (a Triggering
Event Notice to each Holder. At any time after the earlier of a Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice and such
Holder becoming aware of a Triggering Event, at the written election of any Holder, the Company shall redeem such Holder s Preferred
Shares at a price equal to one hundred percent (100 of the Stated Value, which amount shall be paid to the Holder within five
(5) Trading Days of receipt of written notice from the Holder of its election to redeem the Preferred Shares. 

11. Participation .
In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(b), on and after the date of the Approvals, the Holders shall, as holders
of Preferred Shares, be entitled to receive such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of shares of Common Stock
to the same extent as if such Holders had converted each Preferred Share held by each of them into shares of Common Stock (without
regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such
dividends and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution
to the holders of shares of Common Stock (provided, however, to the extent that a Holder s right to participate in any such dividend
or distribution would result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate
in such dividend or distribution to such extent (or the beneficial ownership of any such shares of Common Stock as a result of
such dividend or distribution to such extent) and such dividend or distribution to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the
benefit of such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage).

written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of Incorporation,

of the holders of at least a majority in interest of the outstanding Preferred Shares (the Required Holders ), voting
together as a single class, the Company shall not: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, its Certificate
of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or articles of amendment of any series of shares of preferred
stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions
provided for the benefit, of the Preferred Shares, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the
authorized number of Preferred Shares; (c) issue any Preferred Shares; or (d) without limiting any provision of Section 16, whether

d) enter

directors of the Corporation (even if less than a quorum otherwise required for board approval); or 

e) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. 

14. Lost
or Stolen Certificates. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any certificates representing Preferred Shares (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of the certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new certificate(s) of like tenor and date.

shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations and any of the other

herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach

4. Conversion. 
Provided shareholders having the requisite number of shares of the Company s Common Stock have approved the Purchase Agreement
and all transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance of the Preferred Shares and shares issuable upon exercise of
the Warrant issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and further provided that Nasdaq has issued an approval letter with respect
to the Purchase Agreement and the issuance of the Preferred Shares and shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants being issued
pursuant to the Warrants, each Preferred Share shall be convertible into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock (as defined below) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4 (collectively, the Approvals ). 

(a) Holder s
Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(e), at any time or times on or after the Approvals, each Holder shall
be entitled to convert any whole number of Preferred Shares into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below).

Preferred Share pursuant to Section 4(a) shall be determined according to the following formula (the Conversion Rate : 

Base Amount 

 Conversion Price 

No fractional
shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares. If the issuance would result in the issuance
of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole
share. 

(c) Mechanics
of Conversion. The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner: 

(i) Holder s
Conversion. To convert a Preferred Share into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock on any
date (a Conversion Date ), a Holder shall deliver (whether via email or otherwise), for receipt on or prior
to 11:59 p.m., New York time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion of the share(s) of Preferred Shares subject
to such conversion in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the Conversion Notice to the Company.
If required by Section 4(c)(vi), within five (5) Trading Days following a conversion of any such Preferred Shares as aforesaid,
such Holder shall surrender to a nationally recognized overnight delivery service for delivery to the Company the original certificates
representing the share(s) of Preferred Shares (the Preferred Share Certificates so converted as aforesaid. 

(ii) Company s
Response. On or before the first (1 Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall
transmit by email an acknowledgment of confirmation, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit II, of receipt of such
Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer Agent
to process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms herein. On or before the second (2 nd Trading Day following
the date of receipt by the Company of such Conversion Notice, the Company shall (1) provided that
the Transfer Agent is participating in DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled to such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC through its
Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (2) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities
Transfer Program, issue and deliver (via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a
certificate, registered in the name of such Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder
shall be entitled. If the number of Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion
pursuant to Section 4(c)(vi) is greater than the number of Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall if requested
by such Holder, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Trading Days after receipt of the Preferred Share
Certificate(s) and at its own expense, issue and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a new Preferred Share Certificate representing
the number of Preferred Shares not converted. 

2 

(iii) Record
Holder. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. 

(iv) Company s
Failure to Timely Convert. If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, to issue to a Holder within two (2)
Trading Days after the Company s receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via email or otherwise) (the Share Delivery Deadline ),
 a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled and register such shares of Common
Stock on the Company s share register or to credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for such number of
shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion of any Preferred Shares (as the case may
be) (a Conversion Failure ), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, such Holder, upon
written notice to the Company, may void its Conversion Notice with respect to, and retain or have returned (as the case may be)
any Preferred Shares that have not been converted pursuant to such Holder s Conversion Notice, provided that the voiding of a Conversion
Notice shall not affect the Company s obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant
to the terms of this Certificate of Designations or otherwise and (y) the Company shall pay in cash to such Holder on each day
after such third (3rd) Trading Day that the issuance of such shares of Common Stock is not timely effected an amount equal to 1.5 
of the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock not issued to such Holder on a timely basis and to which the
Holder is entitled and (B) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the last possible
date on which the Company could have issued such shares of Common Stock to the Holder without violating Section 4(c). In addition
to the foregoing, if within two (2) Trading Days after the Company s receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via email or otherwise),
the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to such Holder and register such shares of Common Stock on the Company s
share register or credit such Holder s or its designee s balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case may be), and if on or after such second (2nd) Trading
Day such Holder (or any other Person in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise)
shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of all or any portion of the number of shares of Common
Stock, or a sale of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to all or any portion of the number of shares of Common Stock, issuable
upon such conversion that such Holder so anticipated receiving from the Company, then, in addition to all other remedies available
to such Holder, the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days after such Holder s request and in such Holder s discretion, either
(i) pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holder s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other
out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (including, without limitation, by any other Person
in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) (the Buy-In Price ), at
which point the Company s obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate or credit such Holder s balance account with DTC
for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case
may be) (and to issue such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to so issue and deliver
to such Holder a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit such Holder s balance account with
DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder s conversion hereunder (as the case
may be) and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such
number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (B) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during
the period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending on the date of such issuance and payment under
this clause.

(v) Pro
Rata Conversion; Disputes. In the event the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same Conversion
Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert
from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder s Preferred Shares submitted
for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative
to the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of
shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 22. 

(vi) Book-Entry. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4, upon conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with
the terms hereof, no Holder thereof shall be required to physically surrender the certificate representing the Preferred Shares
to the Company following conversion thereof unless (A) the full or remaining number of Preferred Shares represented by the certificate
are being converted (in which event such certificate(s) shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(vi))
or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting
reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of any Preferred Shares. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records
showing the number of Preferred Shares so converted by such Holder and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method,
reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of the certificate representing
the Preferred Shares upon each such conversion. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge
and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number
of Preferred Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof.
Each certificate for Preferred Shares shall bear the following legend: 

4 

ANY TRANSFEREE OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS
CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF SERIES
A PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(vi) THEREOF. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED
STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAYBE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF
PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(vi) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED
BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 

(d) Taxes. 
The Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp, transfer (but only in respect of the registered holder thereof), issuance
and other similar taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion
of Preferred Shares. 

(e) Limitation
on Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Designations, the Preferred
Shares held by a Holder shall not be convertible by such Holder, and the Company shall not effect any conversion of any Preferred
Shares held by such Holder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially
own in excess of 4.99 (the Maximum Percentage of the Common Stock. To
the extent the above limitation applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Shares held by such Holder shall be convertible
(vis-a-vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by such Holder or any of its affiliates) and of which
such securities shall be convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by such Holder and its affiliates)
shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Company for conversion,
exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability of a Holder to convert Preferred Shares, or of the Company to issue
shares of Common Stock to such Holder, pursuant to this Section 4(e) shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions
of this Section 4(e) with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility or issuance (as the case may be). For purposes
of this Section 4(e), beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect
to calculations of percentage ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section 4(e) shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict
conformity with the terms of this Section 4(e) to correct this Section 4(e) (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Maximum Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary
or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section 4(e) shall
apply to a successor holder of Preferred Shares. The holders of Common Stock shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
4(e) and the Company may not waive this Section 4(e). For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of a Holder,
the Company shall within two (2) Business Days confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number
of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable
securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or securities issued
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. By written notice to the Company, any Holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage
to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99 specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective
until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to such
Holder sending such notice and not to any other Holder. 

5 

(f) Mandatory
conversion . If the 20-day VWAP is greater than one hundred thirty percent (130 of the Conversion Price, for twenty consecutive
trading days and there is an effective registration statement registering the Conversion Shares Mandatory Conversion Date ),
all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert to Common Stock (a Mandatory Conversion ).
However, to the extent that such Mandatory Conversion would result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder
shall not be required to participate in such Mandatory Conversion to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common
Stock as a result of such Mandatory Conversion to such extent) and such Mandatory Conversion to such extent shall be held in abeyance
for such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage
and at such time such shares will automatically convert to Common Stock in one or more series of issuances. Within two Business
Days of the Mandatory Conversion Date, the Company shall deliver to each Holder the Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion
of such Holder s Series A Preferred Stock, and, within two Business Days after receipt of such Conversion Shares, each Holder shall
return the certificates for its Series A Preferred Stock to the Company, provided that, any failure by the Holder to return a certificate
for Series A Preferred Stock will have no effect on the Mandatory Conversion pursuant to this Section, which Mandatory Conversion
will be deemed to occur on the Mandatory Conversion Date. 

5. Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events . 

(a) Purchase
Rights . In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) below, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any
Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all of the record
holders of any class of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon
the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder
had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without taking into
account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares) held by such Holder immediately before the
date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date
as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided,
however, to the extent that such Holder s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder exceeding
the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial
ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent
shall be held in abeyance for such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding
the Maximum Percentage). 

6 

(b) Other
Corporate Events. In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental
Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect
to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a Corporate Event ), the Company shall make appropriate provision
to insure that each Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred Shares held by such
Holder (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which
such Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such
Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility
of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise
receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection
with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares
of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. The provisions of this Section
5(b) shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on
the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations. 

6. Rights
Upon Fundamental Transactions. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and
be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designations
and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Company shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may
exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of
Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company
herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver
to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at any time after the consummation
of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property (except
such items still issuable under Sections 5 and 11, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the conversion
of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity)
or other consideration which each Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction
had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard
to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations), as adjusted in accordance
with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to
successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares. 

7 

7. Certain
Adjustments. 

(a) Issuance
of Lower Priced Securities . If, at any time while the Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Company or any subsidiary, as applicable,
sells or grants any option to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues (or announces
any sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition), any Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents (other than shares
of Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with the Company s stock option plan, shares underlying currently outstanding securities
(or shares/rights to acquire shares issued in settlement of existing indebtedness, provided that the number of shares of Common
Stock issued to satisfy such indebtedness, shall not exceed 750,000 shares), entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock
at an effective price per share that is lower than the then Conversion Price (such lower price, the Base Exercise Price ),
then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to equal at all times the lower of the Base Exercise Price or the Conversion Price as
set forth above. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents are issued (each a Dilutive
Issuance ). If the Company enters into a variable rate transaction, the Company shall be deemed to have issued Common Stock
or Common Stock equivalents at the lowest possible conversion price at which such securities may be converted or exercised. The
Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than three (3) Trading Days following the issuance of any Common Stock or
Common Stock equivalents subject to this Section), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price,
exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the Dilutive Issuance Notice ). For purposes
of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section, upon the occurrence
of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Common Shares based upon the Base Conversion Price on or
after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Conversion Price in the
Notice of Conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing in no event, until after the Approvals have been obtained, shall the Conversion
Price be reduced to an amount less than 20 of closing bid price of Common Stock on the Trading Day prior to initial closing. 

(b) Adjustment
of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock . Without limiting any provision of Sections 5 and 11, if
the Company at any time on or after the Initial Issuance Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization
or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price
in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision of Sections 5 and
11, if the Company at any time on or after the Initial Issuance Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise)
one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall become effective
immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under this Section
7(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Conversion Price shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 

(c) Other
Events. In the event that the Company (or any Subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not strictly
applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect any Holder from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated
by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting
of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Board shall in good faith determine
and implement an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of such Holder, provided that no such
adjustment pursuant to this Section 7 will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section?, provided
further that if such Holder does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution,
then the Board and such Holder shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing
to make such appropriate adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne
by the Company. 

(d) Calculations. 
All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made by rounding to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a cent or the nearest
1/100th of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares
owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale
of Common Stock. 

8 

8. Authorized
Shares. 

(a) Reservation. 
The Company shall, following receipt of the Approvals, initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to 200 of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Base Amount of each Preferred Share as of the
Initial Issuance Date (assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
have been issued, such Preferred Shares are convertible at the Conversion Price and without taking into account any limitations
on the conversion of such Preferred Shares set forth in herein) issuable pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations
from the Initial Issuance Date through the second anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date (assuming for purposes hereof, that
all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement have been issued and without taking into account any limitations
on the issuance of securities set forth herein). So long as any of the Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Company shall, following
receipt of the Approvals, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of
Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares, as of any given date, 200 of the number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Preferred Shares issued
or issuable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement have been issued and without taking into account any limitations on the issuance of securities set forth
herein), provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so available be less than the number of shares required
to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions contained in this Certificate of Designations)
(the Required Amount ). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Preferred Shares
and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of Preferred
Shares held by each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares (as the case may be) (the
 Authorized Share Allocation ). In the event a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder s Preferred
Shares, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common
Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders
of Preferred Shares, pro rata based on the number of Preferred Shares then held by such Holders. 

(b) Insufficient
Authorized Shares . If, notwithstanding Section 8(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time, following receipt of the Approvals,
while any of the Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares
of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to have available for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Amount (an Authorized Share Failure ), then the Company shall
promptly take all action necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow
the Company to reserve and have available the Required Amount for all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure,
but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting
of its stockholders or conduct a consent solicitation for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common
Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit its stockholders approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its
Board to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 8 shall limit any obligations
of the Company under any provision of the Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing shares of
Common Stock upon a conversion of any Preferred Share due to the failure by the Company to have sufficient shares of Common Stock
available out of the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock (such unavailable number of shares of Common Stock, the Authorization
Failure Shares ), in lieu of delivering such Authorization Failure Shares to such Holder of such Preferred Shares, the Company
shall pay cash in exchange for the cancellation of such Preferred Shares convertible into such Authorized Failure Shares at a price
equal to the sum of(i) the product of(x) such number of Authorization Failure Shares and (y) the Closing Sale Price on the Trading
Day immediately preceding the date such Holder delivers the applicable Conversion Notice with respect to such Authorization Failure
Shares to the Company and (ii) to the extent such Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of Authorization Failure Shares, any brokerage commissions and other
out-of-pocket expenses, if any, of such Holder incurred in connection therewith. 

9 

9. Voting
Rights . Except as otherwise expressly required by law, upon any vote held after the Approvals, each holder of Preferred Shares
shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to shareholders of the Company and shall be entitled to the number of votes
for each Preferred Share owned at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on such matter or, if
no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders is solicited, equal to
the number of shares of Common Stock such Preferred Shares are convertible into (voting as a class with Common Stock), but not
in excess of the conversion limitations set forth in Section 4(e) herein. Except as otherwise required by law, the holders of Preferred
Shares shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock on all matters and shall not vote as a separate class. 

10. Optional
and Triggered Redemption 

(a) Company
Redemption. At any time commencing at the earlier of (i) six months after the Initial Issuance Date, or (ii) upon registration
for resale of the Conversion Shares under the Securities Act, and provided that no Equity Conditions Failure (as defined below)
exists, the Company shall have the right to redeem all or part of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (the Company Redemption
Amount ). The Preferred Shares subject to redemption described herein shall be redeemed by the Company, in cash at a price
per Preferred Share (the Company Redemption Price equal to one hundred and twenty percent (120 of the Stated
Value. The Company may exercise its redemption option under this Section I0(a) by delivering a written notice thereof by facsimile
or electronic mail to all, but not less than all, of the Holders (the Company Redemption Notice and the date
all of the Holders received such notice is referred to as the Company Redemption Notice Date ). The Company Redemption
Notice shall be irrevocable. The Company Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Redemption shall occur
(the Company Redemption Date which date shall not be less than fifteen (15) Trading Days nor more than twenty-five
(25) Trading Days following the Company Redemption Notice Date, (y) certify that there has been no Equity Conditions Failure and
(z) state the aggregate Company Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares which is being redeemed in such Company Optional Redemption
from such Holder and all of the other Holders of the Preferred Shares pursuant to this Section IO(a) on the Company Optional Redemption
Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if no Equity Conditions Failure has occurred as of the Company Optional
Redemption Notice Date but an Equity Conditions Failure occurs at any time prior to the Company Redemption Date, (A) the Company
shall provide each Holder a subsequent notice to that effect and (B) unless such Holder waives the Equity Conditions Failure, the
Company Redemption with respect to such Holder shall be cancelled and the applicable Company Redemption Notice shall be null and
void and (ii) at any time prior to the date the Company Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Redemption Amount may be
converted, in whole or in part, by any Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 4. All Conversion Amounts converted
by a Holder after the Company Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the Company Redemption Amount of the Preferred Shares of such
Holder required to be redeemed on the Company Redemption Date. In the event of the Company s redemption of any of the Preferred
Shares under this Section l0(a), a Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability
to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for such
Holder. Accordingly, any redemption premium due under this Section 10(a) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed,
a reasonable estimate of such Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company shall have no right to effect a Company Redemption if any Triggering Event has occurred and is continuing, but any
Triggering Event shall have no effect upon any Holder s right to convert Preferred Shares in its discretion. Equity Conditions
Failure means that that on the date specified, the Equity Conditions are not met in whole or in part. 

10 

(b) Triggering
Event Redemption. 

(i) Triggering
Event . Each of the following events shall constitute a Triggering Event : 

a. the
suspension from trading or failure of the Common Stock to be traded or listed (as applicable) on the Nasdaq market on or prior
to 90 days after the closing of the SCWorx Acquisition (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), for a period of five (5) consecutive
Trading Days; or 

b. the
Company s shareholders do not approve the Transaction Documents on or before January 31, 2019, subject to extension for up to 30
days upon the mutual agreement of the Company and a majority in interest of the Holders. 

(ii) Notice
of a Triggering Event; Redemption Right. Upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event with respect to the Preferred Shares, the
Company shall within one (1) Business Day deliver written notice thereof via facsimile or electronic mail (a Triggering
Event Notice to each Holder. At any time after the earlier of a Holder s receipt of a Triggering Event Notice and such
Holder becoming aware of a Triggering Event, at the written election of any Holder, the Company shall redeem such Holder s Preferred
Shares at a price equal to one hundred percent (100 of the Stated Value, which amount shall be paid to the Holder within five
(5) Trading Days of receipt of written notice from the Holder of its election to redeem the Preferred Shares. 

11. Participation .
In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(b), on and after the date of the Approvals, the Holders shall, as holders
of Preferred Shares, be entitled to receive such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of shares of Common Stock
to the same extent as if such Holders had converted each Preferred Share held by each of them into shares of Common Stock (without
regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such
dividends and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution
to the holders of shares of Common Stock (provided, however, to the extent that a Holder s right to participate in any such dividend
or distribution would result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate
in such dividend or distribution to such extent (or the beneficial ownership of any such shares of Common Stock as a result of
such dividend or distribution to such extent) and such dividend or distribution to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the
benefit of such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage). 

11 

12. Vote
to Change the Terms of or Issue Preferred Shares . In addition to any other rights provided by law, except where the vote or
written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of Incorporation,
without first obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting
of the holders of at least a majority in interest of the outstanding Preferred Shares (the Required Holders ), voting
together as a single class, the Company shall not: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, its Certificate
of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or articles of amendment of any series of shares of preferred
stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions
provided for the benefit, of the Preferred Shares, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the
authorized number of Preferred Shares; (c) issue any Preferred Shares; or (d) without limiting any provision of Section 16, whether
or not prohibited by the terms of the Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares. 

13. Negative
Covenants. As long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, unless the holders of at least 67 in Stated Value of the then
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall have otherwise given prior written consent, the Corporation shall not, and shall not
permit any of the Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly: 

a) amend
its charter documents, including, without limitation, its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in any manner that materially
and adversely affects any rights of the Holder; 

b) repay,

Common Stock Equivalents or Junior Securities, other than as to the Conversion Shares as permitted or required under the Transaction
Documents; 

c) pay
cash dividends or distributions on Junior Securities of the Corporation; 

d) enter
into any transaction with any Affiliate of the Corporation which would be required to be disclosed in any public filing with the
Commission, unless such transaction is made on an arm s-length basis and expressly approved by a majority of the disinterested
directors of the Corporation (even if less than a quorum otherwise required for board approval); or 

e) enter
into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. 

14. Lost
or Stolen Certificates . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any certificates representing Preferred Shares (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of the certificate(s), the Company shall execute and deliver new certificate(s) of like tenor and date. 

12 

15. Remedies,
Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief . The remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations
shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations and any of the other
Transaction Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and no
remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy. Nothing herein
shall limit any Holder s right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms
of this Certificate of Designations. The Company covenants to each Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this
instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion
and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by a Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided
herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach
by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such breach may
be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, each Holder shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any such breach or any such threatened breach, without
the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. The Company shall provide all information
and documentation to a Holder that is requested by such Holder to enable such Holder to confirm the Company s compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Certificate of Designations. 

16. Noncircumvention. 
The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or
through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities,
or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate of
Designations, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all
action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision
of this Certificate of Designations, the Company (i) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable
upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (ii) shall take all such actions as may
be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares and (iii) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action
necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting
the conversion of the Preferred Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to
effect the conversion of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). 

17. Failure
or Indulgence Not Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other
or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and
signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to be jointly drafted
by the Company and all Holders and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof. 

18. Notices. 
The Company shall provide each Holder of Preferred Shares with prompt written notice of all actions taken pursuant to the terms
of this Certificate of Designations, including in reasonable detail a description of such action and the reason therefor. Whenever
notice is required to be given under this Certificate of Designations, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice must be in
writing and shall be given in accordance with Section 5.4 of the Purchase Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall give written notice to each Holder (i) promptly following any adjustment of the Conversion Price, setting forth
in reasonable detail, and certifying, the calculation of such adjustment and (ii) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date
on which the Company closes its books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the Common Stock,
