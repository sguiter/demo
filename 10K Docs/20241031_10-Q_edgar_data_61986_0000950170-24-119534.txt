 tradition of providing high-quality, customer-focused products and support services to its markets. Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States, Manitowoc is one of the world's leading providers of engineered lifting solutions. Manitowoc, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, markets, distributes, and supports comprehensive product lines of mobile hydraulic cranes, lattice-boom crawler cranes, boom trucks, and tower cranes under the Aspen Equipment, Grove, Manitowoc, MGX Equipment Services, National Crane, Potain, and Shuttlelift brand names. The Company serves a wide variety of customers, including dealers, rental companies, contractors, and government entities, across the petrochemical, industrial, commercial construction, power and utilities, infrastructure and residential construction end markets. Due to the ongoing and predictable maintenance needed by cranes, as well as the high cost of crane downtime, Manitowoc s aftermarket support operations provide the Company with a consistent stream of recurring revenue. The Company has reportable segments, the Americas segment, the Europe and Africa ("EURAF") segment and the Middle East and Asia Pacific MEAP segment. The Americas segment includes the North America and South America continents. The EURAF reporting segment includes the Europe and Africa continents, excluding the Middle East region. The MEAP reporting segment includes the Asia and Australia continents and the Middle East region. The segments were identified using the management approach, which designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Refe r to Note 16, Segments, for additional information. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the cash flows for the same nine month periods and the financial positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and except as otherwise discussed, such adjustments consist of only those of a normal recurring nature. The audited balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited annual financial statements.

See Note 10, Debt, for a description of the 2031 Notes and the related carrying value. The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company estimates the fair value of its 2031 Notes based on quoted market prices of the instruments; because these markets are typically actively traded, the liabilities are classified as Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term variable debt, including any amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility, approximate fair value, without being discounted as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to the short-term nature of these instruments. FX Forward Contracts are valued through an independent valuation source which uses an industry standard data provider, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2. See Note 5, Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information. The Deferred Compensation Plan utilizes a rabbi trust to hold assets intended to satisfy the Company s corresponding future benefit obligations. The plan assets and corresponding obligations for Program B under the Deferred Compensation Plan are classified within Level 1.

 reportable segments: Americas, EURAF, and MEAP. The Company's operating segments were identified as its reportable segments. The CODM evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Segment net sales are recognized in the geographic region where the product is sold. The Company does not include intercompany sales between segments for management reporting purposes. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, cost of sales directly attributable to the segment, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Manufacturing variances generated within each operating segment are maintained in each segment s operating income. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, income taxes, nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs.

. As of September 30, 2024, the largest self-insured retention level for new occurrences currently maintained by the Company is million per occurrence and applies to product liability claims arising in North America. As of September 30, 2024, current and long-term product liability reserves were million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, current and long-term product liability reserves were million and million, respectively. Current product liability reserves are included within other liabilities and long-term product liability reserves are included within other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts are not reduced for insurance recoveries for claims above the Company's self-insured retention level. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had and million, respectively, of estimated insurance recoveries included in other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Reserves for product-related lawsuits were estimated using a combination of actual case reserves and actuarial methods. Based on the Company s experience in defending product liability claims, management believes the reserves are adequate for estimated case resolutions on aggregate self-insured claims and insured claims. Any recoveries from insurance carriers are dependent upon the legal sufficiency of claims and solvency of insurance carriers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had reserves of million and million, respectively, for warranty and other related claims included in product warranties and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain of these warranty and other related claims involve matters in dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation, arbitration, or litigation. See Note 18, Guarantees, for further information. It is reasonably possible that the estimates for warranty and other related claims, product liability, asbestos-related claims, and other various legal matters may change based upon new information that may arise or matters that are beyond the scope of the Company s historical experience. Presently, there are no reliable methods to estimate the amount of any such potential changes. The ultimate resolution of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2017, the Company received an Information Request from the United States Environmental Protection Agency U.S. EPA relating to the sales of cranes manufactured between January 1, 2014 and July 31, 2017 and the Company s related participation in the Transition Program for Equipment Manufacturers (the TPEM program). The TPEM program allowed equipment manufacturers to delay installing engines meeting Tier 4 final emission standards in their products, subject to certain percentage allowance restrictions. The Company has provided, and continues to provide, information to the U.S. EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice U.S. DOJ on the approximately 1,420 engines included in the Company s cranes relating to the TPEM program and other certification matters. The Company is engaged in confidential discussions with the U.S. EPA and U.S. DOJ with respect to these matters. Based on management's current assessment of the facts underlying these matters, the Company recorded an additional charge of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. The total recorded estimated liability in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. Other than the foregoing, the Company is unable to provide further meaningful quantification as to the final resolution of these matters. However, the Company calculated the statutory maximum penalties under the Clean Air Act to be approximately million. The Company believes it has strong legal and factual defenses and will vigorously defend any allegations of noncompliance and the factors that could apply in the assessment of any civil penalty. Final resolution of these matters may have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

million and million, respectively. The total amount of buyback commitments given by the Company and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. These amounts are not reduced for amounts the Company would recover from the repossession and subsequent resale of the cranes. The buyback commitments expire at various times through 2032. The Company also has various loss guarantees with maximum liabilities of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These amounts are not reduced for amounts the Company would recover from the repossession and subsequent resale of the cranes securing the related guarantees. In the normal course of business, the Company provides its customers a warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured by the Company. Such warranties generally provide that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from to . In addition, the Company may incur other warranty related costs outside of its standard warranty period. Costs for other warranty-related work are recorded in the period a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.

 Orders and Backlog 
 Orders and backlog are not measures defined by GAAP and our methodology for determining orders and backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies. Management uses orders and backlog for capacity and resource planning. The Company believes this information is useful to investors to provide an indication of future revenues. Backlog represents the dollar value of orders which are expected to be recognized in net sales in the future. Orders are included in backlog when an executed binding contract with a price that has a floor has been received but has not been recognized in net sales. 
 Orders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 20.0 to 424.7 million from 531.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower demand in the Americas. Demand was impacted by uncertainty related to the U.S. presidential election and the high-interest rate environment. Orders were favorably impacted by 1.5 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Orders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 12.4 to 1,407.2 million from 1,606.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower demand in the Americas and EURAF segments. Demand in 
 23 

the Americas was impacted by uncertainty related to the U.S. presidential election and the high-interest rate environment. Orders were favorably impacted by 1.5 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, total backlog was 742.1 million, a 19.1 decrease from the December 31, 2023 backlog of 917.2 million, and a 27.8 decrease from the September 30, 2023 backlog of 1,028.1 million. The decrease in backlog from December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to lower demand during the year. Backlog was favorably impacted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates by 1.4 million and 11.4 million from December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Engineering, selling and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at 238.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 240.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to 2.9 million of lower costs associated with a legal matter with the U.S. EPA when compared to the prior year. Engineering, selling, and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.4 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.6 million as compared to 8.4 million for the same period in 2023. Interest expense increased year-over-year primarily due to higher average debt during the period and higher interest rates on borrowings from the Company's ABL revolving credit facility. See further detail at Note 10, Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.4 million as compared to 25.5 million for the same period in 2023. Interest expense increased year-over-year primarily due to higher average debt during the period and higher interest rates on borrowings from the Company's ABL revolving credit facility. See further detail at Note 10, Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) - Net 
 Other income (expense) - net was (4.9) million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.1 million for the same period in 2023. Other income (expense) net during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily composed of 3.2 million of currency loss and 1.1 million of non-cash losses associated with the refinancing of the Company s 2026 Notes. Other income (expense) net during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily composed of 3.0 million of net foreign currency transaction gains, partially offset by 1.5 million of pension benefit and postretirement health costs. 
 
 Other income (expense) - net was (3.9) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and (10.0) million for the same period in 2023. Other income (expense) - net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily composed of 2.2 million of pension related costs, 1.4 million of currency loss, and 1.1 million of non-cash losses associated with the refinancing of the Company s 2026 Notes, partially offset by 0.7 million of interest income. Other income (expense) net during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily composed of a 9.3 million non-cash write-off of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the curtailment of operations in Russia and 4.5 million of pension benefit and postretirement health costs, partially offset by 4.8 million of net foreign currency transaction gains. 
 
 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of 0.3 million and zero, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the Company s benefit for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is driven by the tax impact of lower income compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by 2.0 million of discrete tax expense recorded in the current year as compared to 3.1 million of discrete tax benefit recorded in the prior year. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of 3.2 million and a benefit for income taxes of 1.0 million, respectively. The increase in the Company s tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relative to the prior year primarily relates to changes in the discrete tax recorded year over year, partially offset by lower income compared to the prior year. 
 Segment Operating Performance 
 The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company has three reportable segments: the Americas segment, EURAF segment and MEAP segment. Further information regarding the Company s reportable segments can be found in Note 16, Segments, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Americas 
 Americas segment net sales increased 3.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 287.1 million from 276.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher new crane shipments. Non-new machine sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6 million when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher used crane shipments and remanufacturing work. 
 
 Americas segment operating income remained relatively flat at 23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 23.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decline was primarily due to unfavorable product mix, offset by higher net sales. 
 
 Americas segment net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 867.0 million as compared to the 860.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher new crane shipments. Non-new machine sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were flat when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Americas segment operating income decreased 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 76.5 million from 81.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix, 2.3 million of higher engineering, selling, and administrative expenses and 0.6 million of higher restructuring costs. This was partially offset by higher net sales. 
 
 EURAF 
 EURAF segment net sales decreased 15.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 126.8 million from 150.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower number of new crane shipments, primarily in the Company s tower crane product offering. Non-new machine sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.7 million when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in field service work. Segment net sales was favorably impacted by 1.6 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 EURAF segment operating loss increased 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 14.9 million from 7.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to the lower net sales and lower absorbed costs due to lower manufacturing volume. 
 
 EURAF segment net sales decreased 13.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 446.0 million from 514.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower number of new crane shipments. Non-new machine sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 declined 6.2 million when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower aftermarket parts and used crane shipments. Segment net sales was favorably impacted by 2.3 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 EURAF segment operating loss increased 35.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 33.5 million from operating income of 2.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to the lower net sales and lower absorbed costs due to lower manufacturing volume. 
 
 MEAP 
 MEAP segment net sales increased 18.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 110.9 million from 93.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to 9.1 million of higher non-new machine sales, as a 
 26 

result of higher used crane shipments. Segment net sales was favorably impacted by 0.8 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 MEAP segment operating income decreased 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 10.0 million from 12.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix. 
 
 MEAP segment net sales increased 4.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 269.0 million from 256.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to 11.2 million of higher non-new machine sales, as a result of higher used crane shipments. Segment net sales was unfavorably impacted by 0.6 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 MEAP segment operating income decreased 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 27.5 million from 40.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable product mix.

The increase in net cash used for operating activities was primarily due to lower net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and an increase in net working capital primarily related to higher inventory. 
 Cash Flows From Investing Activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities of 29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 25.5 million from 54.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash used for investing activities was due to 25.5 million of lower capital expenditures. 
 Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 81.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 73.6 million from 7.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to 77.4 million of additional proceeds from the revolving credit facility and a 9.6 million increase of proceeds from other debt net when compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by 6.7 million of payments for other financing activities and 6.2 million of payments for debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2026 Notes.

The Company believes its liquidity and expected cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet expected working capital, capital expenditure, and other general ongoing operational needs in the subsequent twelve months. 
 Cash Sources 
 The Company has historically relied primarily on cash flows from operations, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and overdraft facilities, issuances of notes, and other forms of debt financing as its sources of cash. 
 The maximum availability under the Company s current ABL Revolving Credit Facility is 325.0 million. The borrowing capacity under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is based on the value of inventory, accounts receivable and certain fixed assets of the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, by substantially all of the personal property and fee-owned real property of the Loan Parties. The liens securing the ABL Revolving Credit Facility are senior in priority to the second-priority liens securing the obligations under the 2031 Notes and the related guarantees. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 18, 2029, and includes a 75.0 million letter of credit sub-facility, 10.0 million of which is available to the German Borrower. 
 In addition to the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has access to committed and non-committed lines of credit to fund working capital in Europe and China. There are six lines of credit, of which five are denominated in Euros totaling 37.0 million and one denominated in Chinese Yuan for 30.0 million. Total U.S. dollar availability as of September 30, 2024 for the six lines of credit is 45.5 million, with 39.5 million outstanding.

Both the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2031 Notes include customary covenants and events of default. Refer to Note 10, Debt, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussions of covenants for the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and 2031 Notes. Based upon management s current plans and outlook, the Company believes it will be able to comply with these covenants during the subsequent twelve months. From time to time, the Company seeks to opportunistically raise capital in the debt capital markets and bank credit markets.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 The Company uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, Adjusted ROIC and free cash flows, which are financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, as additional metrics to evaluate the Company s performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to readers regarding business trends that can be used in evaluating its results because these financial measures provide a consistent method of comparing financial performance and are commonly used by investors to assess performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and are not substitutes for, the GAAP financial information provided herein. 
 Adjusted ROIC 
 Adjusted ROIC measures how efficiently the Company uses invested capital in its operations. Adjusted ROIC is not a measure defined by GAAP and the Company s methodology for determining Adjusted ROIC may vary from the methodology used by other companies. Management and the Board of Directors use Adjusted ROIC as a measure to assess operational performance and capital allocation. The Company believes this information is useful to investors as it provides a measure of value creation as a percentage of capital invested. 
 Adjusted ROIC is determined by dividing adjusted net operating profit after tax Adjusted NOPAT for the trailing twelve-months ended by the five-quarter average of invested capital. Adjusted NOPAT is calculated for each quarter by taking operating income plus the addback of amortization of intangible assets, and the addback or subtraction of restructuring expenses, other non-recurring items net, and provision for income taxes, which is determined using a 15 tax rate. Invested capital is defined as net total assets less cash and cash equivalents and income tax assets - net plus short-term and long-term debt. Income taxes are defined as income tax payables/receivables, net deferred tax assets/liabilities, and uncertain tax positions. 
 
 The Company s Adjusted ROIC as of September 30, 2024 was 6.2 . Below is the calculation of Adjusted ROIC as of September 30, 2024.
