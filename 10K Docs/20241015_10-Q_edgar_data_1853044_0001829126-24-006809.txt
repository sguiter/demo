CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Some of the statements contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 

the market opportunity of Aeries; 

our ability to maintain the listing of the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants on Nasdaq, and the potential liquidity and trading of such securities; 

our ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, our ability to grow and manage growth profitably and retain our key employees; 

our business development efforts to maximize our potential value and to retain and expand our customer base; 

our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

our financial performance; 

our ability to continue as a going concern; 

the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; 

our success in retaining or recruiting officers, key employees or directors, or any necessary changes to these positions; 

changes in applicable laws or regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions; 

our ability to develop and maintain effective internal controls; 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy; 

general economic and political conditions, such as the effects of the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflicts, pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak, recessions, interest rates, inflation, local and national elections, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters; and 

other factors discussed in this report. 

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties may be amplified in the future and there may be additional risks that we currently consider immaterial or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

AERIES TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands of United States dollars except share and per share amounts) 

 (Unaudited) 

of the issued and outstanding shares of AARK and the Former AARK Sole Shareholder of AARK owning the balance . Pursuant to the Business Combination, ATI has a right to appoint two out of the three directors on the board of directors of AARK and therefore has an ability to control the activities undertaken by AARK in ordinary course of business, resulting in AARK being classified as a subsidiary of ATI. Finally, the Business Combination has been accounted for as reverse recapitalization. Refer to the section Reverse Recapitalization below for details. 

Reverse Recapitalization 

As mentioned above Demerger and Business Combination , the Business Combination was closed on November 6, 2023 and has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization because AARK has been determined to be the accounting acquirer under ASC 805 based on the evaluation of the following facts and circumstances taken into consideration: 

The Former AARK Sole Shareholder, who controlled AARK prior to the Business Combination, will retain a majority of the outstanding shares of ATI after giving effect to the Exchange Agreements. The Exchange Agreements are further discussed in Note 10; 

AARK has the ability to elect a majority of the members of ATI s governing body; 

AARK s executive team makes up the executive team of ATI; 

AARK represents an operating entity (group) with operating assets, revenues, and earnings significantly larger than WWAC. 

Under a reverse recapitalization, while ATI was the legal acquirer, it has been treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of pre-combination AARK issuing stock for the net assets of ATI, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of ATI have been stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of pre-combination AARK and relate to the management consulting business. 

Immediately following the Business Combination, there were Class A ordinary shares outstanding with a par value of . Additionally, there were Private Placement Warrants (defined below) and Public Warrants (defined below) outstanding with a right to purchase Class A ordinary shares. 

Upon closing of the Business Combination, the total number of ATI s Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding was . Further, certain Class A ordinary shareholders entered into non-redemption agreements executed on November 3, 2023 and November 5, 2023, to reverse redemptions for an aggregate of 1,652,892 Class A ordinary shares while waiving their right to receive any Bonus Shares issued under the Merger Agreement. In connection with the closing, holders of Class A ordinary shares of ATI were redeemed at a price per share of approximately 10.69. AARK incurred approximately in transaction costs relating to the Business Combination and recorded those costs against additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

The number of Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination were: 

Shares held by Worldwide Webb Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (the Sponsor and other initial holders (2)(3) 

Shares held by Innovo Consultancy DMCC (4) 

Shares held by FPA (as defined below) Holders (5) 

Total (6)

As a result of the Business Combination, the Company s Class A ordinary shares trades under the ticker symbol AERT and its public warrants (the Public Warrants trade under the ticker symbol AERTW on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company s Class A ordinary shares were traded on Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol WWAC. 

Differences between allocations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated balance sheets are reflected in equity as a part of Net shareholders investment and additional paid-in-capital in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Non-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for condensed consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100 of the interests. Changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions. 

in cash and cash equivalents and also generated positive cash flows for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

The Company has historically financed its operations and expansions with cash generated from operations, a revolving credit facility from Kotak Mahindra Bank, and loans from related parties. Management expects to have sufficient cash from the operations, cash reserves and debt capacity for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future to finance our operations, our growth, expansion plans. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, successfully executing our mitigation plan, which includes, (i) raising additional funds from existing or new credit facilities, (ii) raising funds through FPAs or private placements, and (iii) restructure the current liabilities into equity or long-term liabilities. The Company is hopeful of accomplishing its objectives through these measures in the anticipated time frame and also expects that the funds available through the above-mentioned arrangements will be sufficient to alleviate the doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue to operate for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 

Class A ordinary shares to the FPA holders at the redemption price (i.e., 10.69 per share) and, purchase of Recycled Shares through redemption reversals. The amount to be received by ATI from the FPA holders on such issuance of around 3,711,667, shares, are held with the FPA holders as prepaid with respect to the forward transaction. Pursuant to the FPA, ATI was obligated to pay a prepayment amount of which was settled as below: 

against the consideration receivable by ATI for a new issuance of Class A ordinary shares to the FPA holders; and 

representing the cash paid by ATI to the FPA holders to fund the purchase price of the Recycled Shares. 

At the end of the contract period of one year, for each unsold share held by the FPA holders, ATI is obligated to pay FPA holders an amount of in cash or a variable number of ATI s Class A ordinary shares in order to provide a return of per FPA share determined based on the 30-day volume weighted average price of ATI s Class A ordinary shares Maturity Consideration ). The FPA holders have the option to select the form of Maturity Consideration. 

The Optional Termination Right held by the FPA holders economically results in the prepaid forward contract being akin to a written put option with the FPA holders right to sell all or a portion of the Class A ordinary shares to ATI. ATI is entitled over the 12-month maturity period to either a return of the prepayment or the underlying shares, which the FPA holders will determine at their sole discretion depending on the movement in ATI s stock price. 

On April 8, 2024, the Company completed a Private Investment in Public Equity PIPE transaction, with the Class A ordinary shares quoted at approximately 2.21 per share at that time. The Company has Forward Purchase Agreements with Sandia Investment Management LP, Sea Otter Trading, LLC, YA II PN, Ltd, and Meteora Capital Partners, LP (collectively, the FPA Holders ). These agreements contain a price reset feature that allows for adjustments to the share price based on certain predefined conditions, including those triggered by the PIPE transaction. As of the reporting date, this price reset feature was activated, resulting in a new share price of 2.21 per share for the over-the-counter (OTC) Equity Prepaid Forward Transaction. 

This adjustment has implications for the fair value of the derivative liability initially recorded on the balance sheet. Future fluctuations in this fair value will be recognized in earnings. For more details, please refer to Note 13: Fair Value Measurement 

The FPAs consist of two freestanding financial instruments that are accounted for as follows:

The Company uses the BSM option-pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock options on the grant date is affected by the estimated underlying share price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends. The grant date fair value of the Company s stock options granted to employees were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: 

years 

Expected volatility 

Risk free interest rate 

Annual dividend yield 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of and within Selling, general administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated statements of operations, respectively.

The corporate guarantee required the Company to make payment in the event the borrower fails to perform any of its obligations under the credit facilities. The guarantee was withdrawn with effect from June 1, 2023, and the bank communicated the withdrawal on August 23, 2023. Subsequent to the withdrawal, the amount for expected credit loss recognized were reversed in entirety. Pursuant to the arrangement, beginning April 1, 2021, the Company charged a fee of 0.5 of the guarantee outstanding. In the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a guarantee fee income of Nil and within Other income, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 

Indemnification obligations 

In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to a variety of agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These obligations typically arise in contracts where the Company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants for certain matters, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, data privacy violations, and certain tortious conduct in the course of providing services. The duration of these indemnifications varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. 

The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances of each agreement and the fact that certain indemnifications provide for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments under the indemnification. Management is not aware of any such matters that would have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, the Company may be involved in proceedings and litigation, claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, penalties, nonmonetary sanctions, or relief. Management is not currently aware of any material pending legal proceedings, except for ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, in which we or any of our subsidiaries are involved, or where our property is subject to such proceedings. 

Exchange Agreements

Class A ordinary shares issuance to certain vendors

The Company accounted for the Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 given that certain provisions within the warrant agreement either preclude the warrants from being considered indexed to the ATI s own stock or the fixed-for-fixed option criteria are not met. On this basis the Public and Private Placement Warrants are classified as a liability and are measured at fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

Each whole Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value 0.0001 per share, for per share, subject to adjustment as described herein. Only whole Warrants are exercisable. A holder of the Warrants will not be able to exercise any fraction of a Warrant.

The exchange is also subject to certain other specified conditions being met, including achieving certain financial and stock price milestones. Given that this is not solely in control of ATI, the noncontrolling interests have been accounted for in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-1. The redeemable noncontrolling interest has initially been measured at the proportionate share in the net assets of AARK and its subsidiaries in accordance with ASC 805-40-30-3. The cash redemption is not considered to be probable on June 30, 2024 because the specified conditions in relation to EBITDA and revenue have already been met and the Reserve Bank of India and / or applicable regulatory approvals are expected to be received. On this basis the redeemable noncontrolling interest has subsequently been measured by attributing the net income/ loss of AARK pursuant to ASC 810-10.

The valuation of the forward purchase agreement put option liability was made using the following assumptions as of June 30, 2024: 

Risk free Interest Rate 

Volatility 

Reference Price for one Class A ordinary share 

Note: 
 The private placement announced and completed on April 8, 2024. Quoted share price of Class A ordinary shares of the Company when PIPE (Private Investment in Public Entity) transaction took place was 2.21 approx. 

Given that the Public Warrants have a listed price available, the Company classified them as Level 1. The Company has classified the privately placed warrants within Level 3 of the hierarchy as the fair value derived using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses a combination of observable (Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3) inputs. There were no transfers between fair value levels during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

The valuation of the liability for the Private Placement Warrants was made using the following assumptions as of June 30, 2024:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read the following discussion and analysis
together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Among other
things, the condensed consolidated financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the
financial data than included in the following discussion. 

In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our expectations for future performance, liquidity and capital resources that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described under Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, discussed in this quarterly report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31,2024. You should consider these factors carefully in evaluating forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. It is impossible for us to predict new events or circumstances that may arise in the future or how they may affect us. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this quarterly report. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to we, us, our, Aeries, Aeries Technology, and the Company refer to the business and operations of AARK and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Business Combination (excluding the associated legacy financial technology and investing business activities) and to Aeries Technology, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, following the consummation of the Business Combination. 

Overview 

Aeries Technology is a global provider of professional and management services and technology consulting, specializing in the establishment and management of dedicated delivery centers known as Global Capability Centers GCCs for portfolio companies of private equity firms and mid-market enterprises. Our engagement models are designed to provide a mix of deep vertical specialty, functional expertise, and digital systems and solutions to scale, optimize and transform a client s business operations. By leveraging AI, implementing process improvements, and recruiting talent in cost-effective geographies, we are positioned to deliver significant cost savings to our clients. With over a decade of experience, we are committed to delivering transformative business solutions that drive operational efficiency, innovation, and strategic growth. 

We support and drive our clients global growth by providing a range of services, including professional advisory services and operations management services, to build and manage GCCs in suitable and cost-effective locations based on client business needs. With a focus towards digital enterprise enablement, these GCCs are designed to act as seamless extensions of the client organization, providing access to top-tier resources. We believe this empowers our clients to remain competitive and nimble and to achieve their goals of enduring cost efficiencies, operational excellence, and value creation, without sacrificing functional control and flexibility. 

Our advisory services involve the active participation of senior leadership, recommending strategies and best practices related to operating model design, consultation on various areas, market availability for resources with appropriate skillsets required for specific roles contemplated in the service model, regulatory compliance, optimization of tax structure, and more. Our clients can customize the services based on options we provide, and we subsequently firm up the execution plan with the clients. 

A key aspect of our service is our focus on digital transformation. We aim to leverage cutting-edge technologies, including AI, to drive innovation and streamline operations. Our technology services are designed to enhance decision-making, automate processes, and deliver significant business value. We believe this approach through GCC set-up improves operational efficiencies, enabling us to deliver digital transformation services that align with our clients growth strategies and support their competitiveness in an evolving digital landscape. 

30 

Our clients also use our services to manage their organizational operations, including software development, information technology, data analytics, cybersecurity, finance, human resources, customer service and operations. We hire appropriate talent and personnel on our payroll for deployment on client operations. We work with our clients collaboratively to select the appropriate candidates and create functional alignment with the clients organizations. While our talent becomes an extension of our clients team, Aeries continues to provide them with the opportunity for promotion, recognition and career path progression, which we believe results in higher employee satisfaction and lower voluntary attrition rates. We manage the regulatory, tax, recruiting, human resources compliance and branding for each of our GCCs. 

Our purpose-built business model aims to create a more flexible and cost-effective talent pool for deployment on clients operations, while fostering innovation through strategic alignment at senior levels and visibility across the organization. The model also aims to insulate our clients from regulatory and tax issues and provides flexibility in scaling teams up or down based on their changing business needs. We are committed to delivering best practices and success factors by leveraging our visibility into successful strategies from multiple companies, addressing many of the deficiencies associated with the traditional outsourcing and offshoring models. 

As of June 30, 2024, Aeries had more than 30 clients spanning across industry segments, including companies in the industries of e-commerce, telecom, security, healthcare, engineering and others. 

Key Factors Affecting Performance and Comparability 

Market Opportunity 

Our current markets are North America, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East, with a primary focus on the United States. Within these regions we are focused on two primary areas, the private equity ecosystem and the mid-market enterprises. 

Companies are looking out for service providers who not only have the experience and expertise in providing the right-sized solution in this age of ever shortening business cycles but also a trusted partner with a transparent engagement model to lead the customers through the digital transformation journey. Aeries model is purpose-built to provide this experience, expertise and transparent engagement model to accelerate and enhance our clients businesses. 

Private Markets 

As private market investing evolves and the landscape of venture-backed and late-stage private growth companies transforms, our service offerings will adapt accordingly, aligning with the shifting dynamics of potential investors and portfolio companies seeking our expertise. While periods of macroeconomic growth in the United States, particularly in private equity markets, typically foster an upsurge in overall investment activity, any economic slowdowns, downturns, or volatility in the broader market and private equity landscape could potentially dampen this growth momentum. 

Macro-economic headwinds 

Our operational performance is influenced by prevailing economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary climate, and business sentiment. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, there was persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, including concerns over wage inflation, the potential of decelerating global economic growth, and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. These factors have impacted and may continue to impact our business operations. 

31 

Customer Retention and Early Termination of Long-Term Contracts 

Maintaining long-term customer relationships is important to our business, as a significant portion of our revenue is derived from these contracts. Although we have auto-renewal service agreements with clients, they may choose to terminate or not renew, in which case they must provide a notice period, typically ranging from 90 to 180 days, and pay a termination fee based on the commercial margin if termination occurs without cause. There is an increasing likelihood that clients may choose to terminate our service agreements after we have established and operated delivery centers for them, as it becomes more feasible and cost-efficient for them to take over. While the above-described contractual provisions provide some financial protection, the termination fee may not fully offset the long-term revenue loss, and replacing clients can be challenging due to the lengthy customer acquisition cycle. To mitigate this risk, we focus on maintaining strong relationships, expanding our customer base, diversifying service offerings, and delivering high-quality service to encourage renewals or alternative service arrangements when terminations occur. Our operational results and financial condition may still be negatively affected if multiple key customers terminate their agreements around the same time, as replacing this revenue can take time. 

Income Taxes 

We are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and have operations in India, Mexico, Singapore and the United States. Our effective tax rate has historically varied and will continue to vary from year to year based on the tax rate in the jurisdiction of our organization, the geographical sources of our earnings and the tax rates in those countries, the tax relief and incentives available to us, the financing and tax planning strategies employed by us, changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof, and movements in our tax reserves, if any. 

Currently, the Company is liable to pay income tax in India, Mexico, Singapore, and the United States. In India, the Company has chosen to pay taxes according to the newly introduced tax regime in 2019 while forgoing some exemptions and deductions. Consequently, the Company calculates its consolidated provision for income taxes based on the asset and liability method. This involves determining deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the condensed consolidated financial statements and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. These deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which these temporary differences are anticipated to be settled or recovered. If there is evidence that indicates some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, the deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions to determine if they are likely to be sustained upon examination, and a liability is recorded when such uncertainties fail to meet the more likely than not threshold. 

Financing Costs 

We regularly evaluate our variable and fixed-rate debt obligations. We have historically used short and long-term debt to finance our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other investments. In May 2023, Aeries amended its revolving credit facility Amended Credit Facility ), whereby the total borrowing capacity was increased to 3.8 million (at the exchange rate in effect on June 30, 2024), with Kotak Mahindra Bank. The revolving facility is available for Aeries operational requirements. The interest rate is equal to the 6 months Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate MCLR plus a margin of 0.80 as of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Aeries is required to pay interest on the outstanding balance of the credit facility at this financing cost basis, calculated based on the actual number of days for which the funds are utilized. Any changes in the prevailing MCLR rates and the interest rate charged by the bank will affect the financing cost basis and the overall cost of borrowing. 

Aeries also has an outstanding unsecured loan from director of Aeries Technology Group Business Accelerators Pvt Ltd., Mr. Vaibhav Rao, amounting to 0.8 million at an interest rate of 10 per annum. The principal amount of the loan was outstanding in entirety as of and for the period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and year ended March 31, 2024. 

The Company also has an outstanding four-year vehicle loan of 0.1 million at the exchange rate in effect on June 30, 2024 at 10.75 per annum. 

Refer to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements titled Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on our indebtedness.

Results of Operations 

Overview 

The Company has one operating segment and presents and discusses revenues by customer location. The Company believes this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by industry, market and other economic factors. 

The following table shows the disaggregation of the Company s revenues by major customer location. Substantially all of the revenue in our North America region relates to business with customers in the United States.

Our revenues were primarily earned in U.S. dollars. Our costs were primarily incurred in Indian rupees, U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos. We bear a substantial portion of the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and therefore our operating results could be negatively affected by adverse changes in inflation rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Revenue, net 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 0.3 million or 2 , to 16.7 million from 16.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. We experienced revenue growth of 3.3 million primarily due to the addition of new clients, which was offset by a 2.9 million decrease in revenue due to the ramp-down in our existing client engagements and the completion and closure of certain consulting projects. 

Cost of Revenue 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, our cost of revenue increased by 0.8 million or 7 , to 12.7 million from 11.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the increase included a 1.6 million increase in employee compensation and benefits, reflecting an expansion in client-serving headcount to support revenue growth. These cost increases were offset by a 0.9 million decrease in cost related to fees to external consultants. 

Gross Profit 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profit decreased by 0.4 million or 10 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The lower gross profit was primarily due to flat revenue showing 0.3 million increase, against increase of 0.8 million in cost of revenue mainly due to the increased compensation costs and benefits offset by decrease in cost related to fees to external consultants. 

Gross Profit Margin 

For the three months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profit margin decreased by 300 basis points compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributed to decrease in business from the project-based consulting business, which typically yield higher margins due to billing being based on fixed hourly rates. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A expenses increased by 16.8 million, or 457 to 20.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 3.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This significant increase was primarily driven by a 11.4 million increase in stock-based compensation related expense, a 1.5 million increase in legal and professional charges related to the Business Combination, and a 1 million provision for expected credit loss on customer receivables. Additionally, employee compensation and benefits increased by 2.8 million due to the expansion of operations, which required increased hiring, resulting in increased personnel related costs, and travel expenses. 

Total Other Income (expense), net 

Total other income / (expense), net was 0.01
million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to total other expense, net of (0.07) million for the three months ended
June 30, 2023, a 0.08 and 118 change. 

Income tax expenses / (benefit) 

Income tax expense / (benefit) for the three
months ended June 30, 2024, was (1.1) million, a 1.3 million or 600 decrease compared to provision of income taxes of 0.2 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to significant increase in recognition of deferred tax
benefit on losses in certain subsidiaries having a lower jurisdictional tax rates along with a reduction in taxable income resulting
in lower current tax.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate the business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the categories of non-cash items, other than costs related to the Business Combination. We believe the non-GAAP measures presented herein should always be considered along with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the related US GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the US GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures below, and we also discuss our underlying US GAAP results throughout the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, business combination-related costs, and changes in fair value of derivative liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance indicator that we use to evaluate our operating performance and in making financial, operating, and planning decisions. 

We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the reporting period. 

We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful insight to investors by offering a clearer view of Aeries operating performance. This information is frequently utilized by securities analysts and other stakeholders as a measure of financial information and debt service capabilities, and it has been used by our management for internal reporting and planning procedures, including aspects of our consolidated operating budget and capital expenditures. 

The following table provides a reconciliation from net income (US GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Non-GAAP measures) for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the
Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. For the three months ended June 30,
2024, the Company has reported a net loss of 15.3 million. This may raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern for at least 12 months from the date when these financial statements are available to be filed with the SEC. 

The Company acquired approximately 8.7 million in cash shortly following the closing of the Business Combination. The outflow of cash since the closing is primarily attributed to payments of transaction expenses related to the Business Combination. In addition, pursuant to the FPAs entered in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, at the end of the contract period of one year under the FPAs, we may be required to pay the maturity consideration (approximately up to 8 million in cash or a number of Class A ordinary shares valued at 2.50 per share, at the option of the FPA holders) in respect of the FPA Shares held by the FPA holders. We may not have sufficient cash from operations or cash reserves to pay the maturity consideration in the event the FPA holders elect to receive the maturity consideration in cash. Therefore, we may need to rely on our available debt capacity to pay some or all of the maturity consideration. Payment of the maturity consideration in cash would reduce the amount of cash on hand or available debt capacity to fund our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to make necessary investments, and, therefore, could affect our results of operations. 

Our working capital needs are primarily to finance our payroll and other administrative and information technology expenses in advance of the receipt of accounts receivable, as well as increased expenses due to being a public reporting company. Our primary capital requirements include expanding existing operations to support our growth, financing acquisitions and enhancing capabilities, including building certain digital solutions. 

The Company has historically financed its
operations and expansions with cash generated from operations, the revolving credit facility from Kotak Mahindra Bank, and loans
from related parties. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 4.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and the Company also
generated overall positive cash flows totalling 2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Management expects to have
sufficient cash from the operations, cash reserves and debt capacity for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future to
finance our operations, our growth and expansion plans. In addition, we may attempt to raise additional funds through public or
private debt or equity financing. In April 2024, we received net proceeds of 4.68 million by selling 2,261,778 newly issued
Class A ordinary shares in a private placement at a purchase price of 2.21 per share. Also, we are in ongoing negotiations with
relevant parties to potentially restructure the current liabilities into equity or long-term liabilities. The Company is hopeful of
accomplishing its objectives through these measures in the anticipated time frame and also expects that the funds available through
the above-mentioned arrangements will be sufficient to alleviate the doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. However, there is no guarantee that these measures will achieve the desired objectives, and these is no assurance that we
may raise additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Analysis of Cash Flow Changes between the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 

Operating Activities - The decrease of 1.8 million in net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to decrease in net income by 15.8 million as a result of higher cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses; partially offset by increase in adjustment by 11.1 million mainly pertaining to stock-based compensation, and increase due to better working capital management by 2.9 million.

The following is a summary of the basis of preparation and significant accounting policies which have been applied in the preparation of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements. A full description of significant accounting policies is provided in our consolidated carve-out financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates 

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our condensed consolidated financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. A thorough understanding of these critical accounting policies is essential when reviewing our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe the current assumptions, judgments and estimates used to determine amounts reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate; however, actual results may differ under different conditions. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this document. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates contained in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 (the 2024 Form 10-K for a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting estimates since the 2024 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 

Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

On December 11, 2023, the Company concluded that it should restate certain of its previously issued carve-out consolidated financial statements of AARK and subsidiaries to correct the misreporting of basic and diluted earnings per share and number of issued and paid-up common stock, resulting from one of the material weaknesses described below. 

In connection with this restatement, our management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that are primarily attributable to improper segregation of duties, inadequate processes for timely recording of significant events and material transactions, and inadequate design and implementation of information and communication policies, procedures, and monitoring activities. 

Remediation Plan 

In light of these facts, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is in the process of implementing processes and controls and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described above, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with US GAAP. 

To address our material weaknesses, we are improving our processes of reviewing financial statements, increasing our communication with third-party service providers and implementing additional procedures to ensure that the review of the Company s financial statements is supported by sufficient documentation to determine accuracy. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and the controls have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

While management is working to remediate the material weaknesses, there is no assurance that these remediation efforts, when economically feasible and sustainable, will successfully remediate the identified material weaknesses. If we are unable to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence in us and the value of our Class A ordinary shares could be materially and adversely affected and the Company could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Effective process and controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. For as long as we are a smaller reporting company under the U.S. securities laws, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that our management s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. 

38 

Moreover, we do not expect that process and controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In light of the material weaknesses described above, we are taking the actions described above to remediate such material weaknesses. Except as described above, there was not any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may be involved in various proceedings and litigation, claims and other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines, penalties, nonmonetary sanctions, or relief. Management is not currently aware of any material pending legal proceedings, except for ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, in which we or any of our subsidiaries are involved, or where our property is subject to such proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Summary Risk Factors 

A description of the risk factors associated with our business is contained in the Risk Factors section of the 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our Risk Factors as therein previously reported. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 

The following list sets forth information as to all of our securities sold in the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that were not registered under the Securities Act. 

Recent Private Placement 

On April 8, 2024, the Company entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with an institutional accredited investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 2,261,778 newly issued Class A ordinary shares at a purchase price of 2.21 per share; provided, that the issuance of delivery of the shares thereunder shall be subject to a 4.99 beneficial ownership limitation as describe in the agreement, as elected by the investor. At the closing of the private placement, the Company received net proceeds of approximately 4.68 million, after deducting a 6.5 commission paid to a placement agent. The issuance of the shares to the investor pursuant to the Share Subscription Agreement has been conducted in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

Issuance of Adjustment Shares 

In December 2023, the Company settled vendor balances amounting to 0.9 million owed to certain vendors by issuing 361,338 Class A ordinary shares. If the VWAP of the Class A ordinary shares over the three trading days immediately preceding the agreement date is higher than the VWAP over the three trading days immediately preceding the six-month anniversary from the agreement date, additional Class A ordinary shares of the Company would need to be issued for the difference (the Adjustment Shares ). Following the six-month anniversary, the Company issued 54,074 Adjustment Shares to the vendors, in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
