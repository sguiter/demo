Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
 You should read the following discussion together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those which we discuss under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies targeting cancer. Our initial disease target is lung cancer, a serious medical condition with an incidence of over 236,000 new cases in the US in 2022, representing 12.3 of all cancers, and over 130,000 deaths, or 21.4 of all cancers. Worldwide, lung cancer incidence is over 2,200,000 per year (ranking second only after breast cancer), and mortality over 1,800,000 (ranking first). Specifically, we are targeting Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer NSCLC ), which represents 85 of all lung cancers. THIO (6-thio-dG or 6-thio-2 -deoxyguanosine), our lead asset, is an investigational dual mechanism of action drug candidate incorporating telomere targeting and immunogenicity. 
 We have accomplished the following key milestones: 
 In November 2018, we in-licensed THIO from the University of Texas Southwestern UTSW ), in Dallas. The patent license is global and exclusive for the duration of the patients lives. 

In 2019, we generated the first data for THIO demonstrating complete regression with no recurrence when administered in advance of atezolizumab (TecentriQ Genentech), in colorectal and lung cancer preclinical models. 

In the first quarter 2020, we filed a provisional patent application for THIO in sequential combination with checkpoint inhibitors, covering all tumor types. The patent has been allowed as of March 12, 2021, but has not been issued to date. The patent will have an expiration date in 2041, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent extension. 

In the first quarter 2021, we entered into a Drug Supply Agreement with Regeneron. Under the Drug Supply Agreement, Regeneron will provide cemiplimab (Libtayo anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) at no charge for the THIO-101 trials, testing THIO administration for immune activation followed by cemiplimab in NSCLC. The Drug Supply Agreement replaces direct drug purchase expense that we would be otherwise required to incur. In exchange, Regeneron received development exclusivity in NSCLC for the duration of the trial meaning we cannot conduct trials in NSCLC with another checkpoint inhibitor during the time of the trial. All other areas of study and development in any other tumor types remain open. 

In the first quarter 2021, we initiated our clinical supply manufacturing under Good Manufacturing Practices conditions to provide clinical supply for THIO-101 and other development needs. 

In the first half of 2022, we completed a crossover round consisting of sales of 274,840 shares of our common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Common Stock ), at a price of 9.00 per shares for gross proceeds of approximately 2.5 million. 

In the first quarter 2022, THIO received approval by the Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee HREC in Australia to initiate the THIO-101 Phase 2 clinical study. 

23 

In March 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation ODD to THIO for the treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma HCC (liver cancer), and in May 2022, the FDA granted ODD to THIO for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. The FDA s Office of Orphan Products Development may grant orphan designation status to drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases, or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. ODD provides certain benefits, including financial incentives, to support clinical development and the potential for up to seven years of market exclusivity for the drug for the designated orphan indication in the U.S. if the drug is ultimately approved for its designated indication. 

In May 2022, we entered into a research and collaboration agreement with the Nationwide Children s Hospital to evaluate the potential of THIO in combination with current standard-of-care therapies for brain cancer. The organizations are conducting preclinical studies to assess the efficacy and safety of THIO in combination with radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in vitro and in vivo models. 

In July 2022, we completed our selection process for the clinical sites for our Phase 2 study in Australia and Europe and our application to start the Phase 2 study in Australia has been approved. In July 2022, the first patient was administered with THIO in our Phase 2 human trial THIO-101 in Australia. We have also submitted a similar application to conduct the same Phase 2 study in Europe. 

On July 28, 2022, the Company s Common Stock began trading on the NYSE American under the symbol MAIA. On August 1, 2022, the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at 5.00 per share for gross proceeds of 10,000,000 in an IPO, prior to deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. On August 3, 2022, the Company sold an additional 300,000 shares of Common Stock at 5.00 per share when the underwriter exercised the overallotment for net proceeds of 1,500,000 prior to deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. We believe we have raised sufficient capital to fund the THIO-101 lead-in and preliminary efficacy of the phase 2 THIO-101 trial. 

In November 2022, we completed a pre-investigational new drug meeting with the FDA for the planned U.S. expansion of the THIO-101 Phase 2 trial evaluating THIO, an investigational telomere-targeting agent, in patients with advanced NSCLC. 

In December 2022, regulatory authorities in three European countries, Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria, approved the implementation of THIO-101, MAIA s Phase 2 clinical trial. THIO-101 is a critical component of THIO s clinical development process and it is of the utmost importance that we collaborate with leading cancer institutes in Australia and now in Europe, for a target total of 30 clinical trial sites in six countries. 

In the first week of March 2023, the first two patients were dosed in Europe in MAIA s Phase 2 clinical trial, THIO-101 evaluating THIO in patients with advanced NSCLC. Following regulatory clearances in Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria, nine clinical sites have been activated in these three European countries. 

On April 11, 2023, we announced positive topline data related to the completion of Part A, safety lead-in portion of the THIO-101 trial which showed that administration of THIO, at the highest dose of 360 mg/cycle in sequential combination with Regeneron s anti-PD-1 therapy, Libtayo was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities or significant treatment-related adverse events reported. 

On April 18, 2023, we published data in HCC models: as monotherapy, THIO achieved complete and durable responses in HCC, the dominant histology in primary liver cancer (90 ), in in vivo models. When combined with Libtayo , duration of response was further potentiated. Upon rechallenge with two times more cancer cells and no additional treatment, tumor growth was completely prevented. Administration of THIO alone and in combination with Libtayo generated anti-cancer immune memory. 

24 

On April 20, 2023, we announced preliminary survival data from Part A of THIO-101. The first two patients enrolled in Part A of the study continue to be alive, approximately 10 and 9 months respectively, from treatment initiation. Both patients have advanced Stage IV metastatic disease and are heavily pretreated, receiving third and fourth line of therapy respectively after previously failing treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. They continue to be progression free following their last dose of THIO, 7 and 6 months respectively, with no new treatment. The current treatment options in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory NSCLC who failed two or more therapy regimens are limited and show minimal benefit. Furthermore, discontinuation of treatment is rapidly followed by physical decline and death, therefore seeing patients with such survival and no disease progression in this clinical setting, is noteworthy. In real-world clinical practice, observed survival in such heavily pretreated patients is typically 3-4 months. 

On April 27, 2023, we closed a follow-on offering and sold 2,555,500 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of 2.25 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately 5.75 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The shares sold in the offering include the exercise in full by the underwriter of its option to purchase an additional 333,300 shares of Common Stock, in addition to the 2,222,200 shares of Common Stock which the underwriters initially agreed to purchase. 

On June 20, 2023, we announced updates in enrollment in THIO-101 in Europe. To that date, 29 patients had been dosed in THIO-101. With the addition of sites in Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria in March 2023, THIO-101 has rapidly increased the number of patients enrolled and dosed with THIO. Thirteen sites were activated with another two new additional sites ready to open shortly afterward. 

In July 2023, we announced that the first 2 patients dosed with THIO continue to be alive for approximately 12.2 and 11.5 months respectively, from treatment initiation. They have remained free of disease progression for 10.2 and 8.5 months, respectively, without requiring any additional therapy. We also highlighted that out of the first 11 patients with post-baseline scans, 82 (9 patients) met the disease control primary endpoint at first response assessment. For contrast, in similar heavily treated NSCLC patients, typical disease control rates are in the 25-35 range. 

On August 23, 2023, our universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-273984) Form S-3 for possible future offerings was declared effective by the SEC. 

On September 1, 2023, we entered into an at-the-market Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with ThinkEquity LLC (the Sales Agent ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 7,000,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement. The shares will be offered and sold pursuant to the Company s prospectus supplement, filed September 1, 2023 with the SEC to the prospectus forming a part of the Form S-3. We terminated the Sales Agreement on November 15, 2023. We sold 758,388 shares of our Common Stock through the Sales Agent for which the Company received net proceeds of approximately 1,238,688. 

On September 28, 2023, we announced that the Company s board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to 800,000 of the Company s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock through September 2024. The Company expects to fund repurchases by using cash on hand and expected cash flow to be generated in the future. As of September 30, 2023, no repurchases under the program have been executed. 

On October 3, 2023, we announced that the FDA has cleared its investigational new drug application for THIO to be evaluated in the U.S. as part of THIO-101, the Company s ongoing global phase 2 clinical study in patients with advanced NSCLC. THIO is being tested in sequential combination with Regeneron s anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody cemiplimab (Libtayo to evaluate anti-tumor activity and immune response in NSCLC patients. 

On October 10, 2023, we announced that 49 patients have been dosed in MAIA s Phase 2 clinical trial, THIO-101, evaluating THIO in sequential combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced NSCLC. 

On October 24, 2023, we announced the unprecedented interim disease control rate DCR of 100 in second-line treatment that far surpasses standard of care SoC DCR of 53-64 , presented at the 

25 

European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2023. DCR is far stronger than overall response rate ORR in predicting overall survival benefit, as shown in a recent meta-analysis of 74 clinical trials worldwide in NSCLC. 

On November 10, 2023, we announced that the FDA granted THIO ODD as a treatment for glioblastoma. This is the third orphan drug designation granted to THIO following the receipt of orphan drug designations for HCC and small cell lung cancer SCLC in 2022. 

On November 17, 2023, we announced the closing of a 4 million registered direct offering for the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 2,424,243 of its shares of Common Stock at a purchase price of 1.65 per share. In a concurrent private place, MAIA also issued and sold unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,424,243 share of its Common Stock. 

On December 19, 2023, we announced dose selection for THIO-101, a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating its lead asset, THIO, in sequential combination with Regeneron s anti-PD-1 cemiplimab (Libtayo in patients with advanced NSCLC. During the dose-finding stage of THIO-101, patients were administered either 60mg, 180mg, or 360mg of THIO per cycle, followed by 350mg of cemiplimab (Libtayo ). The selected dose, 180mg/cycle, presented better safety profile and outperformed the other doses in the key measures of efficacy for NSCLC trials. Subsequently, all future trial participants will be treated with THIO 180mg/cycle. 

On January 17, 2024, we announced new interim data for our ongoing THIO-101 Phase 2 trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the latest available data from THIO-101 (November 13, 2023), 60 patients had been dosed with THIO in sequential combination with Libtayo . The patients received either 60mg, 180mg, or 360mg of THIO per dose, and 42 had at least one post baseline assessment completed. The observed disease control was well sustained compared to previous scans. 

On February 7, 2024, we announced publication of international Patent Cooperation Treaty PCT application titled Dinucleotides and Their Use in Treating Cancer. The new dinucleotides disclosed in the patent application are telomere-targeting molecules, such as THIO fragments or other THIO analogues. These compounds are key next-generation telomere-targeting agents, an important extension of MAIA s innovative cancer treatment platform. The PCT system streamlines the process for obtaining patent protection globally. Under the PCT, applicants can seek patent protection in a large number of countries. 

On February 14, 2024, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ), to sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to 1,445,000, from time to time, through an at-the-market offering program under which Wainwright will act as sales agent. Effective March 25, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to amend, supplement and supersede certain information contained in the earlier prospectus and prospectus supplement, which increased the number of shares of Common Stock the Company may offer and sell under the ATM Agreement to an aggregate offering price of up to 4,950,000 from time to time. Effective May 15, 2024, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to amend, supplement and supersede certain information contained in the earlier prospectus and prospectus supplement, which increased the number of Shares the Company may offer and sell under the ATM Agreement to an aggregate offering price of up to 11,280,000 from time to time. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have sold 2,985,953 shares of our Common Stock under the ATM Agreement at an average price of 3.16 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 9,440,950, for which we paid Wainwright 283,228 in commissions resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 9,157,722. 

On February 22, 2024, we announced completion of enrollment in Phase 2 THIO-101 go-to-market clinical trial. The trial reached the enrollment target of 41 patients for the 180mg/dose on February 19, 2024. As of the latest data available for the trial, 79 patients had received either 60mg (24 patients), 180mg (41 patients) or 360mg (14 patients). The original trial design targeted up to 182 patients, including all patients in the safety lead-in and 41 patients in each of the 3 tested doses (60mg, 180mg, and 360mg). Following the selection of 180 mg/cycle as the optimal dose in December 2023, all patients were subsequently enrolled at the 180mg/cycle dose and trial enrollment was completed ahead of schedule. 

On March 6, 2024, we announced interim efficacy data for THIO-101 Phase 2 trial in NSCLC. In the latest data available (as of January 8, 2024), the ORR, characterized as partial or complete response to therapy, 

26 

was 38 (3 out of 8 patients) in the efficacy evaluable population for combination THIO 180mg + cemiplimab (Libtayo in third-line treatment for NSCLC patients who failed treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in prior lines of therapy, with or without chemotherapy. 

On March 14, 2024, we issued and sold 2,496,318 shares of our Common Stock and warrants to purchase 2,496,318 shares of our Common Stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors and certain of our directors pursuant to securities purchase agreements dated March 11, 2024 at a price per share of 1.17 for which we received gross proceeds of approximately 2.92 million.

At such time, a total of 68 patients have been dosed and had a post-baseline scan in MAIA s Phase 2 clinical trial, THIO-101, evaluating THIO in sequential combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced NSCLC. Preliminary efficacy across all lines of therapy in this March 2024 data cut were consistent with previous reports including: (i) 75 of patients receiving THIO 180mg as third-line therapy for NSCLC have surpassed the overall survival OS threshold of 5.8 months; (ii) 88 of patients in the same setting (3L, 180mg) also crossed the 2.5 months progression free survival PFS threshold and have shown ORR of 38 , greatly improving on current chemo treatment that have ORRs of around 6-10 ; and (iii) across all third-line patients, DCR of 85 remained superior to current chemotherapy options, which ranges from 25-35 DCR. 

On April 25, 2024, we issued and sold 494,096 shares of our Common Stock and warrants to purchase 494,096 shares of our Common Stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors and Company directors pursuant to securities purchase agreements dated April 22, 2024 at a price per share of 2.034, for which we received gross proceeds of approximately 1.0 million. The warrants issued in the private placement have an exercise price of 2.26, are exercisable six months after issuance and expire 5-years after the initial exercise date. The securities sold to our directors participating in the April 25, 2024 private placement were issued pursuant to the MAIA 2021 Plan. 

On June 4, 2024, we announced new preliminary efficacy data from the Phase 2 THIO-101 clinical trial. The updated included that as of April 30, 2024: (i) all evaluable patients had completed 1 post-baseline assessment; (ii) third-line treatment across all doses had shown DCR of 85 for THIO, 65 of patients crossed the 5.8-month OS threshold identified in literature, 85 of patients crossed the 2.5-month PFS threshold, median survival follow-up time was 9.1 months; and (iii) third-line treatment with THIO 180mg had shown median PFS of 5.5 months, 78 OS rate at 6 months, 38 ORR, 75 of patients crossed the 5.8-month OS threshold, 88 of patients crossed the 2.5-month PFS threshold and median survival follow-up time observed was 9.1 months. 

On June 6, 2024, we announced Company highlights and key achievements year-to-date, including: (i) exceptional measures of efficacy by lead drug THIO in Phase 2 clinical trial, with 38 ORR in third-line (3L) setting (THIO 180mg) compared to ~6 for currently available treatments in a similar population and 5.5 months median progression-free survival (PFS) (3L, THIO 180mg); and (ii) secured continued insider investment through independent board members participation in private placement equity financings, with funding of more than 12M year-to-date. 

On June 7, 2024, we announced the validation of clinical and regulatory pathways for viable therapies leveraging the cell s telomeric functions as evidenced by the FDA approval of imetelstat, a treatment for low- to intermediate-risk hematologic malignancies (myelodysplastic syndromes) from Geron Corporation, illuminating the role of telomere targeting as a viable therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. 

27 

On July 23, 2024, we announced treatment updates from our Phase 2 clinical trial of THIO. As of June 12, the latest clinical cut-off date: (i) 6 patients remain on treatment following at least 12 months of therapy; (ii) treatment with THIO followed by cemiplimab has been well tolerated throughout the trial, with lower toxicity compared to standard-of-care treatments; and (iii) the longest-treated patients have completed 21 cycles of THIO sequenced with cemiplimab. 

On September 10, 2024, we announced updates from our lead clinical candidate THIO, in our Phase 2 clinical trial, THIO-101. The updates included: (i) As of August 1, 2024, 16 patients had survival follow-up surpassing 12 months, including 9 in third line treatment (3L); (ii) Interim median survival follow-up in 3L was 10.6 months.; and (iii) THIO's substantial survival benefit in third line surpasses comparable standard-of-care overall survival of 5.8 months. 

On October 15, 2024, we announced that an abstract related to the Company s second generation of proprietary telomere-targeting THIO prodrugs was accepted for poster presentation at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, taking place October 23-25, 2024, in Barcelona, Spain. MAIA s presentation included results of preclinical studies for its new THIO-based prodrugs, designated as MAIA-2021-20 and MAIA-2022-12, which are lipid-conjugated compounds derived from THIO. The preclinical studies were designed to evaluate the efficacy of the new molecules alone and in combination with or without immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies (anti-PD-L1). 

On November 1, 2024, we issued and sold 1,079,784 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 1,079,784 shares of our common stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors and Company directors pursuant to securities purchase agreements dated October 28, 2024 at a price per share of 2.259 for which we received gross proceeds of approximately 2.44 million. The warrants issued in the private placement have an exercise price of 2.51, are exercisable six months after issuance and expire 5-years after the initial exercise date. The securities sold to our directors participating in the private placement were issued pursuant to our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. 

On November 5, 2024, we announced that a late-breaking abstract (LBA) detailing new updates from its Phase 2 THIO-101 clinical trial was selected for oral and poster presentation at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), being held November 6-10, 2024, in Houston, Texas. The updates include new data on efficacy and safety from its clinical trial evaluating THIO sequenced with Regeneron s immune checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab (Libtayo in patients with advanced NSCLC who have failed two or more standard-of-care therapy regimens. 

In addition to NSCLC, we plan to conduct clinical trials evaluating THIO in sequential combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in several other cancer indications. THIO-102 is a Phase 2 clinical trial planned to target: (i) colorectal cancer, in which THIO demonstrated 100 complete response in pre-clinical setting, with no tumor recurrence after long-term follow-up; (ii) HCC (90 of primary liver cancers), a deadly cancer indication to which MAIA holds an ODD awarded by the FDA in April 2022; (iii) SCLC, the deadliest type of lung cancer, MAIA was also awarded ODD for this indication in August 2022; and (iv) solid tumors, such as breast, prostate, gastric, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. THIO-103 is a Phase 2 clinical trial planned to evaluate treatment with THIO in first-line patients for both NSCLC and SCLC. 

Impact of the War in Ukraine and War in Israel on Our Operations 
 
 The short and long-term implications of war in Ukraine and war in Israel are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of sanctions and counter sanctions may have an adverse effect on the economic markets generally and could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of these events, the Company terminated any planned research activities in the impacted areas.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash totaled approximately 8,691,000 which represented an increase of approximately 1,540,000 compared to December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of approximately 5,631,000 which represents an increase of approximately 3,004,000 compared to December 31, 2023. We have generated no revenues as of September 30, 2024. Our current operating plan indicates that we will continue to incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities given ongoing expenditures related to the completion of its ongoing clinical trials and our lack of revenue generating activities. Based on our cash reserves as of September 30, 2024 of 8,691,000 and current financial condition as of the date of this Quarterly Report, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 To meet the Company s future working capital needs, we will need to raise additional equity or enter into debt financing. While we have historically been able to raise additional capital through issuance of equity and/or debt financing, and we have implemented a plan to control its expenses in order to satisfy its obligations due within one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements, we cannot guarantee that it will be able to raise additional equity, raise debt, or contain expenses. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after these financial statements are issued. 
 
 Sales of Common Stock 
 
 On March 14, 2024, we issued and sold 2,496,318 shares of our Common Stock and warrants to purchase 2,496,318 shares of our Common Stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors and to our participating directors pursuant to securities purchase agreements dated March 11, 2024 at a price 1.17 per share, for which we received gross proceeds of approximately 2.92 million. The securities sold to our directors participating in the March 14, 2024 private placement were issued pursuant to the MAIA 2021 Plan. 
 
 On March 28, 2024, we issued and sold 578,643 shares of our Common Stock and warrants to purchase 578,643 shares of our Common Stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors pursuant to securities purchase agreements dated March 25, 2024 at a price of 2.295 per share, for which we received gross proceeds of approximately 1.33 million. 
 
 Between February 14, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we sold 507,754 shares of Common Stock at an average price of approximately 1.47 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 745,251 under the ATM Agreement dated February 14, 2024, for which we paid Wainwright approximately 22,357 in commissions resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 722,894. Between April 1, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we sold 2,015,122 shares of our Common Stock at an average price of 3.53 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 7,116,978 under the ATM Agreement dated February 14, 2024 with Wainwright, for which we paid Wainwright 213,509 in commissions, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 6,903,469. Between July 1, 2024 and September 30, 2024, we sold 177,606 shares of Common Stock at an average price of approximately 3.72 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 660,437 under the ATM Agreement dated May 15, 2024, for which we paid Wainwright approximately 19,813 in commissions, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately 640,624. 
 
 On April 25, 2024, we issued and sold 494,096 shares of our Common Stock and warrants to purchase 494,096 shares of our Common Stock in a private placement to certain accredited investors and to our participating directors pursuant to securities purchase agreements dated April 25, 2024 at a price of 2.034 per share, for which we received gross proceeds of approximately 1.0 million. The securities sold to our directors participating in the April 25, 2024 private placement were issued pursuant to the MAIA 2021 Plan. 
 
 We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, to develop and commercialize THIO, and to develop, acquire or in-license other products. We may seek to fund our operations through public equity, private equity, or 
 31 

debt financings, as well as other sources. We cannot make any assurances that additional financings will be available to us and, if available, on acceptable terms or at all. This could negatively impact our business and operations and could also lead to the reduction of our operations.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, and our Head of Finance, who is our principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as set forth in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Head of Finance concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are not party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 
 Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 21, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, except as set forth below, there are no additional risk factors added to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American, then our Common Stock would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors ability to effect transactions in our Common Stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
 
 Our Common Stock is currently listed on the NYSE American and the continued listing of our Common Stock on the NYSE American is contingent on our continued compliance with a number of listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American, our Common Stock would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors ability to effect transactions in our Common Stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders equity and a minimum number of public stockholders, as well as satisfy other listing requirements of the NYSE American. In addition to these objective standards, NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer for other reasons involving the judgment of NYSE American. 
 
 While our stockholders equity was approximately 1.62 million as of September 30, 2024, and while we have had losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in each of our fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, we are nevertheless currently in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards as we satisfy alternate compliance standards provided in Section 1003(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide since: (i) the total value of our market capitalization is at least 50,000,000; and (ii) we have at least 1,100,000 shares publicly held, a market value of publicly held shares of at least 15,000,000 and 400 round lot shareholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards and/or continue our listing on the NYSE American in the future. 
 
 If the NYSE American delists our Common Stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect the Common Stock would qualify to be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

reduced liquidity for our securities; 

substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds; 

the loss of institutional investor interest and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; 

35 

a determination that our Common Stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 

potential breaches of representations or covenants of our agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements, which, regardless of merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.
