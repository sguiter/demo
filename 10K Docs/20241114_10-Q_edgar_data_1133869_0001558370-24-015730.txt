NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. The Company has historically financed its research and development activities as well as operational expenses primarily from equity financings, government grants, and payments from distribution agreements and collaboration partners. The Company s principal uses of cash are for research and development expenses, expenses in development of manufacturing capabilities, general and administrative expenses, capital expenditures and other working capital requirements. On June 21, 2021, the Company established an at-the-market program (the ATM Program with an aggregate offering price of up to million, pursuant to a Common Stock Sales Agreement with Wainwright. From June 21, 2021 through October 1, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of common stock under the ATM Program at an average price of approximately per share for gross proceeds of approximately million which represents

 million from Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. Nippon Shinyaku ), which was triggered upon completion of the interim futility analysis of the HOPE-3 trial whereby the outcome was determined to be not futile. In September 2024, the Company completed a private placement with Nippon Shinyaku whereby we issued and sold an aggregate of shares of common stock at a price per share of for an aggregate purchase price of million (see Note 2 Stockholder s Equity ). Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold an aggregate of shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for gross proceeds of approximately million (see Note 9 - Subsequent Events ). The Company s future expenditures and capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the timing and costs associated with our research and development activities, clinical trials and preclinical studies, including the enrollment and progress of our ongoing HOPE-3 Phase 3 clinical trial of deramiocel (also referred to as CAP-1002) in DMD; the timing and costs associated with the manufacturing of our product candidates, including the expansion of our manufacturing capacity to support the potential commercialization of deramiocel for DMD; the timing and costs associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates; the number and scope of our research programs, including the expansion of our exosomes program; the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the costs associated with pursuing marketing approval and potential commercialization of deramiocel in countries outside the United States. 
 The Company s options for raising additional capital include potentially seeking additional financing primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity or debt securities, the licensing or sale of its technology and other assets, potential distribution and other partnering opportunities, and from government grants. The Company has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. The Company s plan to address its financial position may include potentially seeking additional financing primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity or debt securities, the licensing or sale of its technology and from government grants. The Company will require substantial additional capital to fund its operations. The Company cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, financing will be available on favorable or acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing when and if required, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business and results of operations. The Company would likely need to delay, curtail or terminate portions of its clinical trials and research and development programs. To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities, its existing stockholders would experience substantial dilution. in ERC for applicable 2020 and 2021 periods, receiving in 2021 and in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a receivable for for the remainder of funds for which we are still awaiting receipt.

 and shares of common stock, respectively, have been excluded from the computation of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock, which primarily consist of stock options issued to employees, consultants, and directors as well as warrants issued, have been excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation because their effect is anti-dilutive. Because the impact of these items is anti-dilutive during periods of net loss, there was no difference between basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturity. The carrying amounts of the Company s marketable securities are based on market quotations from national exchanges at the balance sheet date. Interest and dividend income are recognized separately on the income statement based on classifications provided by the brokerage firm holding the investments. The fair value of borrowings is not considered to be significantly different from its carrying amount because the stated rates for such debt reflect current market rates and conditions.

Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has filed with the SEC a registration statement to register for resale the shares sold in the Private Placement, which registration statement was declared effective on November 8, 2024. ATM Program The Company established an ATM Program on June 21, 2021, with an aggregate offering price of up to million, pursuant to a Common Stock Sales Agreement with Wainwright by which Wainwright sold our common stock at the market prices prevailing at the time of sale. Wainwright is entitled to compensation for its services at a commission rate of of the gross sales price per share of common stock sold plus reimbursement of certain expenses.

At this time, the Company only issues options under the 2020 Plan and the 2021 Plan and no longer issues options under the 2006 Stock Option Plan, the 2012 Plan, or the 2012 Non-Employee Director Plan. In June 2021, the Company s stockholders approved the 2021 Plan, which authorized shares of common stock reserved under the 2021 Plan for the issuance of stock awards. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan shall be automatically increased on January 1 of each year, commencing with January 1, 2022, by an amount equal to the lesser of of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or such number of shares determined by the compensation committee of the Board. On January 1, 2024 and 2023, and shares were added under the 2021 Plan, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, options remain available for issuance under the respective stock option plans. The Company s stock option plans are administered by the Board, in conjunction with the compensation committee of the Board, which determines the recipients and types of awards to be granted, as well as the number of shares subject to the awards, the exercise price and the vesting schedule. Each stock option granted will be designated in the award agreement as either an incentive stock option or a nonstatutory stock option. Notwithstanding such designation, however, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by the participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any parent or subsidiary) exceeds , such options will be treated as nonstatutory stock options.

 and per share, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of each option award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The company used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: - - Expected term 5 - 5 - Dividend yield Risk-free interest rates - - Employee and non-employee stock-based compensation expense was as follows: Research and development Total The Company does not recognize an income tax benefit as the Company believes that an actual income tax benefit may not be realized. For non-qualified stock options, the loss creates a timing difference, resulting in a deferred tax asset, which is fully reserved by a valuation allowance. Common stock, stock options or other equity instruments issued to non-employees (including consultants) as consideration for goods or services received by the Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company calculates the fair value for non-qualified options as of the date of grant and expenses over the applicable vesting periods. The Company accounts for forfeitures upon occurrence. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized fair value compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was approximately million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years.

The Company s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in excess of the FDIC insured limits as of September 30, 2024, were approximately million. The Company monitors the financial stability of the financial institutions with which it maintains accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.

Pursuant to terms of the CIRM Award, the disbursements were tied to the achievement of specified operational milestones. In addition, the terms of the CIRM Award included a co-funding requirement pursuant to which Capricor was required to spend approximately million of its own capital to fund the CIRM funded research project. The CIRM Award is further subject to the conditions and requirements set forth in the CIRM Grants Administration Policy for Clinical Stage Projects. Such requirements include, without limitation, the filing of quarterly and annual reports with CIRM, the sharing of intellectual property pursuant to Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) Sections 100600-100612, and the sharing with the State of California of a fraction of licensing revenue received from a CIRM funded research project and net commercial revenue from a commercialized product which resulted from the CIRM funded research as set forth in Title 17, CCR Section 100608. The maximum royalty on net commercial revenue that Capricor may be required to pay to CIRM is equal to times the total amount awarded and paid to Capricor. After completing the CIRM funded research project and at any time after the award period end date (but no later than the anniversary of the date of the award), Capricor has the right to convert the CIRM Award into a loan, the terms of which will be determined based on various factors, including the stage of the research and development of the program at the time the election is made. On June 20, 2016, Capricor entered into a Loan Election Agreement with CIRM whereby, among other things, CIRM and Capricor agreed that if Capricor elects to convert the grant into a loan, the term of the loan could be up to from the date of execution of the applicable loan agreement; provided that the maturity date of the loan will not surpass the anniversary of the grant date of the CIRM Award. Beginning on the date of the loan, the loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance, plus the interest that has accrued prior to the election point according to the terms set forth in the CIRM Loan Policy and CIRM Grants Administration Policy for Clinical Stage Projects (the New Loan Balance ), at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR rate for a three-month deposit in U.S. dollars, as published by the Wall Street Journal on the loan date, plus percent. Interest shall be compounded annually on the outstanding New Loan Balance commencing with the loan date and the interest shall be payable, together with the New Loan Balance, upon the due date of the loan. If Capricor elects to convert the CIRM Award into a loan, certain requirements of the CIRM Award will no longer be applicable, including the revenue sharing requirements. Capricor has not yet made its decision as to whether it will elect to convert the CIRM Award into a loan. Depending on the timing of our election, additional funds may be owed. If we elect to do so, Capricor would be required to repay the amounts awarded by CIRM; therefore, the Company accounts for this award as a liability rather than income. In 2019, Capricor completed all milestones and close-out activities associated with the CIRM Award and expended all funds received. As of September 30, 2024, Capricor s liability balance for the CIRM Award was approximately million.

The JHU License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect in each applicable country until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent within the patent rights, or, if no patents are issued, then for from the effective date. Under the terms of the JHU License Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement should the other party become insolvent or file a petition in bankruptcy, or fail to cure a material breach within after notice. In addition, Capricor may terminate for any reason upon written notice. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center License Agreements License Agreement for CDCs On January 4, 2010, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the Original CSMC License Agreement ), for certain intellectual property related to its cardiosphere-derived cell CDC technology. In 2013, the Original CSMC License Agreement was amended twice resulting in, among other things, a reduction in the percentage of sublicense fees which would have been payable to CSMC. Effective December 30, 2013, Capricor entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the Amended CSMC License Agreement ), which amended, restated, and superseded the Original CSMC License Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, certain definitions were added or amended, the timing of certain obligations was revised and other obligations of the parties were clarified. The Amended CSMC License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marb n on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license for any future rights, Capricor will have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations. Pursuant to the Original CSMC License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor was obligated to reimburse CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the prosecution of certain patent rights. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain spending and development milestones. Pursuant to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, Capricor remains obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights, subject to certain exclusions. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty-bearing product. The Amended CSMC License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Amended CSMC License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within for non-payment of royalties; (v) after notice from CSMC if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within ; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights.

 notice from CSMC, instead of terminating the license, CSMC has the option to convert any exclusive license to Capricor to a non-exclusive or co-exclusive license. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within after notice. Capricor and CSMC have entered into several amendments to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to add and delete certain patent applications from the list of scheduled patents and extend the timing of certain development milestones, among other things. Capricor reimbursed CSMC for certain attorneys fees and filing fees incurred in connection with the additional patent applications. License Agreement for Exosomes On May 5, 2014, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the Exosomes License Agreement ), for certain intellectual property rights related to CDC-derived exosomes technology. The Exosomes License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) in order to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and to develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marb n on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license, Capricor shall have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations. Pursuant to the Exosomes License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor reimbursed CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the preparation and prosecution of certain patent applications. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain non-monetary development milestones and is obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a single-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty bearing product. The Exosomes License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Exosomes License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within for non-payment of royalties; (v) after if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within ; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights. If Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights and fails to cure that breach after notice from CSMC, instead of terminating the license, CSMC has the option to convert any exclusive license to Capricor to a non-exclusive or co-exclusive license. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within after notice. Capricor and CSMC have entered into several amendments to the Exosomes License Agreement. Collectively, these amendments added additional patent applications and patent families to the Exosomes License Agreement, added certain defined product development milestone payments, modified certain milestone deadlines, added certain performance milestones with respect to product candidates covered by certain future patent rights in order to maintain an exclusive license to those future patent rights, and converted certain exclusive rights to co-exclusive rights. These amendments also obligated Capricor to reimburse CSMC for certain attorneys fees and filing fees in connection with the additional patent applications and patent families.

 million in 2022. The first milestone payment of million was paid upon completion of the interim futility analysis of the HOPE-3 trial whereby the outcome was determined to be not futile. Additionally, there are potential milestones totaling up to million leading up to and including the BLA approval. Further, there are various potential sales-based milestones, if commercialized, tied to the achievement of certain sales thresholds for annual net sales of deramiocel of up to million. Subject to regulatory approval, Capricor will have the right to receive a meaningful mid-range double-digit share of product revenue which falls between and percent. The Company has evaluated the U.S. Distribution Agreement in accordance with ASU 606, Revenue for Contracts from Customers . At the inception, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the performance obligation is the conduct of the HOPE-3, Phase 3 clinical study. The Company determined the transaction price totaled million, which was the upfront payment of million and million milestone payment. The Company has excluded any future milestone or shared revenue payments from this transaction price to date based on probability. The Company has allocated the million transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation. Revenue will be recognized using a proportional performance method in relation to the completion of the HOPE-3 clinical study, Cohort A arm, to determine the extent of progress towards completion. Under this method, the transaction price is recognized over the contract s entire performance period using a cost percentage per patient visit relative to the total estimated cost of patient visits. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million as revenue compared to approximately million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately million as revenue compared to approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In relation to the U.S. Distribution Agreement, as of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded approximately million as current deferred revenue on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company had no opening or closing contract asset balances recognized. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company s contract liability results from the Company performance of services in connection to its performance obligation. The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. As of September 30, 2024, remaining performance obligations related to the U.S. Distribution Agreement were approximately million. At this time, we estimate of the remaining performance obligations are expected to be recognized over the next . Remaining performance obligations estimates are subject to change.

 million in the first quarter of 2023, and in addition, Capricor may potentially receive additional development and sales-based milestone payments of up to approximately million, subject to foreign currency exchange rates, and a meaningful double-digit share of product revenue. Nippon Shinyaku will be responsible for the distribution of deramiocel in Japan. Capricor will be responsible for the conduct of clinical development and regulatory approval in Japan, as may be required, as well as the manufacturing of deramiocel. In addition, Capricor or its designee will hold the Marketing Authorization in Japan if the product is approved in that territory. The Company has evaluated the Japan Distribution Agreement in accordance with ASU 606, Revenue for Contracts from Customers . The Company determined the initial transaction price totaled million, which was the upfront payment fee. The Company has excluded any future milestone or shared revenue payments from this transaction price to date based on probability. At this time, the Company is evaluating the regulatory pathway to achieve potential product approval in this territory. Until such time, the Company cannot identify any distinct performance obligation. As such, the Company has recorded the entire upfront payment fee of million as current deferred revenue on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. Binding Term Sheet with Nippon Shinyaku (Territory: Europe) On September 16, 2024, Capricor entered into a Binding Term Sheet (the Term Sheet with Nippon Shinyaku for the commercialization and distribution of deramiocel for the treatment of DMD in the European region, as defined in the Term Sheet. Subject to finalization of a definitive agreement, under the terms of the Term Sheet, Capricor would be responsible for the development and manufacturing of deramiocel for potential approval in the European region. Nippon Shinyaku would be responsible for the sales and distribution of deramiocel in the European region. Subject to regulatory approval, Capricor would receive a double-digit share of product revenue and additional development and sales-based milestone payments. If the definitive agreement is entered into on the same economic terms as the term sheet, Capricor will receive an upfront payment of million upon execution of the definitive agreement, with potential additional development and sales-based milestone payments of up to million. Upon execution of the definitive agreement, the Company will evaluate the terms in accordance with ASU 606, Revenue for Contracts from Customers . As of September 30, 2024, nothing has been recorded or received. per month for consulting services. The agreement is terminable upon notice. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to this Consulting Agreement.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the condensed consolidated notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to Capricor Therapeutics, the Company, we, us, our or similar terms include Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary. References to Capricor are with respect to Capricor, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary. Overview Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of transformative cell and exosome-based therapeutics for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD ), a rare form of muscular dystrophy which results in muscle degeneration and premature death, and other diseases with high unmet medical needs. Since our inception, we have devoted substantial resources to developing deramiocel (also referred to as CAP-1002) and our other product candidates including our exosomes platform technology, developing our manufacturing processes, staffing our company and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for commercial sale. Our ability to eventually generate any product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful development, approval and eventual commercialization of deramiocel for the treatment of DMD and our other product candidates. If successfully developed and approved, we intend and plan to commercialize deramiocel in the United States, Europe and Japan with our partner, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation Nippon Shinyaku ), and may enter into licensing agreements or strategic collaborations in other markets. If we generate product sales or enter into licensing agreements or strategic collaborations, or further distribution relationships, we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year as a result of the timing and amount of any product sales, license fees, milestone payments and other payments. If we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected. Our core program is focused on the development and commercialization of a cell therapy technology (referred herein as deramiocel) comprised of cardiosphere-dervied cells CDCs ), which are a population of stromal cells isolated from donated cells of healthy human hearts, for the treatment of DMD. Deramiocel is designed to slow disease progression in DMD through the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic actions of CDCs, which are mediated by secreted exosomes laden with bioactive cargo. Among the cargo elements known to be bioactive in CDC-exosomes are microRNAs. Collectively, these non-coding RNA species alter gene expression in macrophages and other target cells, dialing down generalized inflammation and stimulating tissue regeneration in DMD (and in a variety of other inflammatory diseases). This mechanism of action, consistent with the changes observed in clinical studies to date in circulating inflammatory biomarkers, contrasts with that of exon-skipping oligonucleotides and gene therapy approaches, which aim to restore dystrophin expression. DMD pathophysiology is driven by the impaired production of functional dystrophin which normally functions as a structural protein in muscle. The reduction of functional dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In DMD patients, heart muscle cells progressively die and are replaced with scar tissue. This cardiomyopathy eventually leads to heart failure, which is currently the leading cause of death among those with DMD. The annual cost of care for patients with DMD is very high and increases with disease progression. There is no currently approved treatment for cardiomyopathy in DMD, therefore, we believe that DMD represents a significant market opportunity for our product candidate, deramiocel. To date, we have completed multiple promising clinical trials investigating deramiocel for treatment of DMD. The results of our Phase 2, HOPE-2 study were published in The Lancet showing that the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of the mid-level dimension of the Performance of the Upper Limb PUL v1.2 (p=0.01) and additional positive 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 endpoints of full PUL v2.0 (p=0.04) and a cardiac endpoint of left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.002). Deramiocel was generally safe and well-tolerated throughout the study. Additionally, we are currently conducting an open label extension OLE study of the HOPE-2 trial in which 12 patients have elected to continue treatment of deramiocel. We recently presented three-year data showing a statistically significant benefit (+3.7 points, p In August 2024, we held a pre-BLA meeting with FDA, where we discussed our rolling BLA submission schedule, potential label expansion, plans for commercial manufacturing as well as other topics. Subsequent to this meeting, we held several additional meetings with FDA and announced our intent to file a Biologics License Application BLA based on existing cardiac data from the Phase 2 HOPE-2 and HOPE-2 OLE trials compared to patient-level natural history data to treat all patients diagnosed with DMD-cardiomyopathy. We initiated the BLA filing in October of 2024 and the full submission is expected to be completed by year end 2024. To support potential label expansion to treat DMD, we plan to provide clinical data on skeletal muscle myopathy by combining Cohorts A and B of the Phase 3 HOPE-3 clinical trial to serve as a post-approval study and do not intend to unblind Cohort A at this time, which was originally planned to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024. Furthermore, if necessary, the HOPE 3 study will also be supporting ex-U.S. marketing authorizations. Currently, we have initiated regulatory activities in Europe and Japan and will be working with the various health authorities to develop the most efficient path for regulatory approval of deramiocel in these regions. The regulatory pathway for deramiocel in the U.S. is supported by RMAT designation as well as orphan drug designation. In addition, if Capricor were to receive FDA marketing approval for deramiocel for the treatment of DMD, Capricor would be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher PRV based on its previous receipt of a rare pediatric disease designation. Capricor retains full rights to the PRV, if received. Further, Capricor has entered into two Commercialization and Distribution Agreements with Nippon Shinyaku appointing Nippon Shinyaku as its exclusive distributor of deramiocel in the United States and Japan. We continue to develop our engineered exosome technology using our proprietary StealthX platform focused on the areas of targeted therapeutics and vaccines to potentially treat and prevent a diverse array of diseases. Exosomes are membrane-bound extracellular vesicles that contain lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. They act as messengers to regulate the functions of neighboring or distant cells. Their size, low or null immunogenicity and ability to communicate in native cellular language potentially make them an exciting new class of therapeutic agents with the potential to expand our ability to address complex biological responses. Our StealthX platform is focused on developing precision-engineered exosomes that have the ability to deliver defined sets of effector molecules that exert their effects through defined mechanisms of action to the defined target. Our platform builds on advances in fundamental RNA and protein science, targeting technology and manufacturing, providing us the opportunity to potentially build a broad pipeline of new therapeutic candidates. At this time, we are developing exosome-based vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases, monogenic diseases and other potential indications. Our current strategy is focused on securing partners who will provide capital and additional resources to enable us to bring this program into the clinic. In the first quarter of 2024, we announced that we have been selected to be part of Project NextGen, an initiative by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to advance a pipeline of new, innovative vaccines providing broader and more durable protection for COVID-19. As part of Project NextGen, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID ), part of the National Institutes of Health, will conduct a Phase 1 clinical study with our StealthX vaccine, subject to regulatory approval. Currently, our StealthX vaccine candidate is in the manufacturing phase with current plans to deliver it to NIAID in the first quarter of 2025. At this time, we are updating the Investigational New Drug Application IND we have previously submitted to the FDA for our StealthX vaccine, so that the NIAID IND can refer to it. Subject to FDA clearance, NIAID plans to initiate this trial in the first quarter of 2025 and we expect to have preliminary data available in the second quarter of 2025, subject to availability from NIAID. Furthermore, if NIAID finds 

 30 

Table of Contents 
 that our StealthX vaccine meets its criteria for safety and efficacy, they may consider funding our program further into a Phase 2 study. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling approximately 85.0 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 5,073,800 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 86.3 million. We believe that our existing cash balance will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. We have not generated any revenues from the commercial sale of products. We will not be able to generate any product revenues until, and only if, we receive approval to sell our drug candidates from the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Due to our significant research and development expenditures, and general administrative costs associated with our operations, we have generated substantial operating losses in each period since our inception. Our net losses were approximately 12.6 million and 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net losses were approximately 33.4 million and 21.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 192.7 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. As we seek to develop and commercialize deramiocel or any other product candidates including those related to our exosomes program, we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly and that we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations. Until such time when we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity financings, debt financings or other sources, which may include licensing agreements or strategic collaborations or other distribution agreements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, if at all. If we fail to raise capital or other potential funding or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of deramiocel or our other product candidates. Financial Operations Overview We have no commercial product sales to date and will not have the ability to generate any commercial product revenue until after we have received approval from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling our product candidates. Developing biological products is a lengthy and very expensive process. Even if we obtain the capital necessary to continue the development of our product candidates, whether through a strategic transaction or otherwise, we do not expect to complete the development of a product candidate for several years, if ever. To date, most of our development expenses have related to our product candidates, consisting of deramiocel and our exosome technologies. As we proceed with the clinical development of deramiocel, and as we further develop our exosome technologies, our expenses will further increase. Accordingly, our success depends not only on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, but also on our ability to finance the development of our products and our clinical programs. Our recent major sources of working capital have been primarily proceeds from public equity sales of securities and upfront payments pursuant to our Distribution Agreements with Nippon Shinyaku. While we pursue our preclinical and clinical programs, we continue to explore potential partnerships for the development of one or more of our product candidates in the US and in other territories across the world. Our results have included non-cash compensation expense due to the issuance of stock options and warrants, as applicable. We expense the fair value of stock options and warrants over their vesting period as applicable. When more precise pricing data is unavailable, we determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The terms and vesting schedules for share-based awards vary by type of grant and the employment status of the grantee. Generally, the awards vest based upon time-based conditions. Stock-based compensation expense is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations under general and administrative G A or research and development R D expenses, as applicable. We expect to record additional non-cash compensation expense in the future, which may be significant.

 Results of Operations Revenue Clinical Development Income . Clinical development income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 2.3 million and 6.2 million, respectively. Clinical development income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 11.1 million and 13.1 million, respectively. The Company currently recognizes 40.0 million in payments received from Nippon Shinyaku related to an Exclusive Commercialization and Distribution Agreement (the U.S. Distribution Agreement ). Revenue is ratably recognized using a proportional performance method in relation to the completion of the HOPE-3 clinical trial (Cohort A). Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses. R D expenses consist primarily of compensation and other related personnel costs, supplies, clinical trial costs, patient treatment costs, rent for laboratories and manufacturing facilities, consulting fees, costs of personnel and supplies for manufacturing, costs of service providers for preclinical, clinical and manufacturing, certain legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution, stock-based compensation expense and other expenses relating to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our product candidates. The following table summarizes our R D expenses by category for each of the periods indicated:

The increase was primarily driven by the following: 0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to increases in headcount; 0.1 million increase in compensation and other personnel expenses related to increases in headcount: 0.2 million increase in depreciation primarily related to leasehold improvements of our San Diego headquarters; and 0.2 million increase in other corporate expenses. Other Income Investment Income . Investment income for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 0.5 million. Investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 1.5 million and approximately 1.3 million, respectively. The increase in investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due to increased interest rates and the higher principal balance in our marketable securities, savings and money market fund accounts. Products Under Active Development Deramiocel for the treatment of DMD We are currently conducting our HOPE-3, Phase 3 study for DMD and our ongoing OLE study of the HOPE-2 trial for which we expect to spend approximately 30.0 million to 35.0 million in 2024. The expenses for our DMD program will include costs for personnel, clinical, regulatory and manufacturing-related expenses, including expenses related to the scale-up for potential commercial scale manufacturing if our deramiocel product is approved. Exosome-Based Therapeutics and Vaccines Our exosome platform is in preclinical development. We expect to spend approximately 3.0 million to 5.0 million during 2024 on development expenses related to our exosomes program, which includes personnel, preclinical studies and manufacturing related expenses for these technologies. Our expenses for this program are primarily focused on the expansion of our engineered exosomes platform including the manufacturing of our StealthX vaccine to be used in connection with our collaboration with NIAID. Our expenditures on current and future clinical development programs, particularly our deramiocel and exosomes programs, cannot be predicted with any significant degree of certainty as they are dependent on the results of our current trials and our ability to secure additional funding and a strategic partner. Further, we cannot predict with any significant degree of certainty the amount of time which will be required to complete our clinical trials, the costs of completing research and development projects or whether, when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during manufacturing and clinical development and as a result of a variety of other factors, including: the number of trials and studies in a clinical program; the number of patients who participate in the trials; the number of sites included in the trials; 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 the rates of patient recruitment and enrollment; the duration of patient treatment and follow-up; the costs of manufacturing our product candidates; the availability of necessary materials required to make our product candidates; the costs, requirements and timing of, and the ability to secure, regulatory approvals; and the availability and cost of facilities needed to manufacture our products. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and is intended to supplement the more detailed discussion that follows. The amounts stated in the tables below are expressed in thousands. 

Liquidity and capital resources September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 68,377 14,695 Marketable securities 16,651 24,793 Working capital 65,348 19,586 Stockholders equity 68,265 22,601 

Nine months ended September 30, Cash flow data 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (25,199) (14,003) Investing activities 7,198 10,971 Financing activities 71,684 2,413 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 53,683 (619) Our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were approximately 85.0 million compared to approximately 39.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is primarily due to equity financings through our at-the-market offering and 15.0 million private placement with Nippon Shinyaku. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 24.7 million in total liabilities, of which approximately 13.1 million relates to deferred revenue, and approximately 65.3 million in net working capital. Cash used in operating activities was approximately 25.2 million and approximately 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of approximately 11.2 million in cash used in operating activities is due to approximately 11.8 million increase in net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Furthermore, there was an increase of approximately 1.9 million in stock-based compensation and a decrease of approximately 1.6 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. To the extent we obtain sufficient capital and/or long-term debt funding and are able to continue developing our product candidates, including if we expand our platform technology portfolio, engage in further research and development activities, and, in particular, conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials, we expect to continue incurring substantial losses. We had cash flow provided by investing activities of approximately 7.2 million and approximately 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The change in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 is due to the net effect from purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities and the decrease of approximately 0.4 million in leasehold improvements. We had cash flow provided by financing activities of approximately 71.7 million and approximately 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is due

Table of Contents 
 to the net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our at-the-market program and Nippon Shinyaku private placement. Our estimates regarding the sufficiency of our financial resources are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner than planned or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: the progress of our clinical and research activities; the number and scope of our clinical and research programs; the progress and success of our preclinical and clinical development activities; the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements; our ability to successfully manufacture product for our clinical trials and potential commercial use; the availability of materials necessary to manufacture our product candidates; the costs of manufacturing our product candidates, and the progress of efforts with parties with whom we may enter into commercial manufacturing agreements, if necessary; our ability to maintain current research and development programs and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements; additional costs associated with maintaining licenses and insurance; the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the costs and timing of obtaining marketing approval both in the United States and in countries outside of the United States. 
 Collaborations Commercialization and Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku (Territory: United States) On January 24, 2022, Capricor entered into a Commercialization and Distribution Agreement (the U.S. Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku, a Japanese corporation. Under the terms of the U.S. Distribution Agreement, Capricor appointed Nippon Shinyaku as its exclusive distributor in the United States of deramiocel for the treatment of DMD. Under the terms of the U.S. Distribution Agreement, Capricor will be responsible for the clinical development and manufacturing of deramiocel. Nippon Shinyaku and NS Pharma, Inc. (its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary) will be responsible for the distribution of deramiocel in the United States. Pursuant to the U.S Distribution Agreement, Capricor received an upfront payment of 30.0 million in 2022. The first milestone payment of 10.0 million was paid upon completion of the interim futility analysis of the HOPE-3 trial whereby the outcome was determined to be not futile. Capricor received this milestone payment from Nippon Shinyaku in January 2024. Additionally, there are potential milestones totaling up to 90.0 million leading up to and including the BLA approval. Further, there are various potential sales-based milestones, if commercialized, tied to the achievement of certain sales thresholds for annual net sales of deramiocel of up to 605.0 million. Commercialization and Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku (Territory: Japan) On February 10, 2023, Capricor entered into a Commercialization and Distribution Agreement (the Japan Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku. Under the terms of the Japan Distribution Agreement, Capricor appointed Nippon Shinyaku as its exclusive distributor in Japan of deramiocel for the treatment of DMD. Under the terms of the Japan Distribution Agreement, Capricor received an upfront payment of 12.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 and in addition, Capricor will potentially receive additional development and sales-based milestone payments of up to approximately 89.0 million, subject to foreign currency exchange rates, and a meaningful double-digit share of product revenue. Nippon Shinyaku will be responsible for the distribution of deramiocel in Japan. Capricor will

Table of Contents 
 be responsible for the conduct of clinical development and regulatory approval in Japan, as may be required, as well as the manufacturing of deramiocel. Subject to regulatory approval, Capricor or its designee will hold the Marketing Authorization in Japan if the product is approved in that territory. Binding Term Sheet with Nippon Shinyaku (Territory: Europe) On September 16, 2024, Capricor entered into a Binding Term Sheet (the Term Sheet with Nippon Shinyaku for the commercialization and distribution of deramiocel for the treatment of DMD in the European region, as defined in the Term Sheet. Subject to finalization of a definitive agreement, under the terms of the Term Sheet, Capricor would be responsible for the development and manufacturing of deramiocel for potential approval in the European region. Nippon Shinyaku would be responsible for the sales and distribution of deramiocel in the European region. Subject to regulatory approval, Capricor would receive a double-digit share of product revenue and additional development and sales-based milestone payments. If the definitive agreement is entered into on the same economic terms as the term sheet, Capricor will receive an upfront payment of 20.0 million upon execution of the definitive agreement, with potential additional development and sales-based milestone payments of up to 715.0 million. Financing Activities by the Company September 2023 Financing On September 29, 2023, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a registered direct offering (the Registered Direct Offering ), an aggregate of 4,935,621 shares of its common stock, par value 0.001 per share, at a price per share of 4.66 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 23.0 million. Each share of common stock offered was sold with a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of 5.70 per share. Each warrant became exercisable beginning six months after issuance and will expire seven years from the date of issuance. ATM Program On June 21, 2021, the Company initiated an at-the-market offering under a prospectus supplement for aggregate sales proceeds of up to 75.0 million (the ATM Program ), with the common stock to be distributed at the market prices prevailing at the time of sale. The ATM Program was established under a Common Stock Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement, ), with H.C. Wainwright Co. LLC Wainwright ), under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock through Wainwright as sales agent. The Sales Agreement provides that Wainwright will be entitled to compensation for its services at a commission rate of 3.0 of the gross sales price per share of common stock sold. All shares issued pursuant to the ATM Program were issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-254363), which was initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), on March 16, 2021, amended on June 15, 2021 and declared effective by the SEC on June 16, 2021. From June 21, 2021 through October 1, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 9,228,383 shares of common stock under the ATM Program at an average price of approximately 8.13 per share for gross proceeds of approximately 75.0 million which represents all amounts that were available to be sold. Effective October 1, 2024, the ATM Program was closed and terminated. The Company paid cash commissions on the gross proceeds, plus reimbursement of expenses to Wainwright, as well as legal and accounting fees, in the aggregate amount of approximately 2.4 million. September 2024 Private Placement On September 16, 2024, the Company entered into Subscription Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to Nippon Shinyaku in a private placement (the Private Placement ), an aggregate of 2,798,507 shares of the common stock of the Company at a price per Share of 5.36, which was issued at a 20 premium to the 60-day VWAP, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 15.0 million. The Subscription Agreement also includes lock-up provisions restricting Nippon Shinyaku from selling or otherwise disposing of shares of Common Stock until the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date.

Table of Contents 
 In connection with the Private Placement, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku on September 16, 2024 (the Registration Rights Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has filed with the SEC a registration statement to register for resale the shares sold in the Private Placement, which registration statement was declared effective on November 8, 2024. October 2024 Underwritten Public Offering On October 16, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement with Piper Sandler and Oppenheimer as representatives of the underwriters (the Underwriters ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and issue, in a public offering an aggregate of 5,073,800 shares of common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares to cover over allotments, at a public offering price of 17.00 per share for total gross proceeds of approximately 86.3 million, before deducting underwriting commissions and other offering expenses payable by Capricor. The Company paid cash commissions on the gross proceeds, plus reimbursement of expenses to the Underwriters, as well as legal and accounting fees in the aggregate amount of approximately 5.5 million. CIRM Grant Award On June 16, 2016, Capricor entered into an award (the CIRM Award with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine CIRM in the amount of approximately 3.4 million to fund, in part, Capricor s Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne clinical trial investigating deramiocel for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy. Pursuant to terms of the CIRM Award, the disbursements were tied to the achievement of specified operational milestones. In addition, the terms of the CIRM Award included a co-funding requirement pursuant to which Capricor was required to spend approximately 2.3 million of its own capital to fund the CIRM funded research project. The CIRM Award is further subject to the conditions and requirements set forth in the CIRM Grants Administration Policy for Clinical Stage Projects. Such requirements include, without limitation, the filing of quarterly and annual reports with CIRM, the sharing of intellectual property pursuant to Title 17, California Code of Regulations (CCR) Sections 100600-100612, and the sharing with the State of California of a fraction of licensing revenue received from a CIRM funded research project and net commercial revenue from a commercialized product which resulted from the CIRM funded research as set forth in Title 17, CCR Section 100608. The maximum royalty on net commercial revenue that Capricor may be required to pay to CIRM is equal to nine times the total amount awarded and paid to Capricor. After completing the CIRM funded research project and at any time after the award period end date (but no later than the ten-year anniversary of the date of the award), Capricor has the right to convert the CIRM Award into a loan, the terms of which will be determined based on various factors, including the stage of the research and development of the program at the time the election is made. On June 20, 2016, Capricor entered into a Loan Election Agreement with CIRM whereby, among other things, CIRM and Capricor agreed that if Capricor elects to convert the grant into a loan, the term of the loan could be up to five years from the date of execution of the applicable loan agreement; provided that the maturity date of the loan will not surpass the ten-year anniversary of the grant date of the CIRM Award. Beginning on the date of the loan, the loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance, plus the interest that has accrued prior to the election point according to the terms set forth in the CIRM Loan Policy and CIRM Grants Administration Policy for Clinical Stage Projects (the New Loan Balance ), at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR rate for a three-month deposit in U.S. dollars, as published by the Wall Street Journal on the loan date, plus one percent. Interest shall be compounded annually on the outstanding New Loan Balance commencing with the loan date and the interest shall be payable, together with the New Loan Balance, upon the due date of the loan. Depending on the timing of our election, additional funds may be owed. If Capricor elects to convert the CIRM Award into a loan, certain requirements of the CIRM Award will no longer be applicable, including the revenue sharing requirements. Capricor has not yet made its decision as to whether it will elect to convert the CIRM Award into a loan. If we elect to do so, Capricor would be required to repay the amounts awarded by CIRM, therefore the Company accounts for this award as a liability rather than income. In 2019, Capricor completed all milestones and close-out activities associated with the CIRM Award and expended all funds received. As of September 30, 2024, Capricor s liability balance for the CIRM Award was approximately 3.4 million.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including research and development and clinical trial accruals, and stock-based compensation estimates. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes. Leases ASC Topic 842, Leases ASC 842 ), requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet with a corresponding right-to-use ROU asset. ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are evaluated for impairment using the long-lived assets impairment guidance. Leases will be classified as financing or operating, which will drive the expense recognition pattern. The Company elects to exclude short-term leases if and when the Company has them. The Company leases office and laboratory space, all of which are operating leases. Most leases include the option to renew and the exercise of the renewal options is at the Company s sole discretion. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. In addition, the Company s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. For real estate leases, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 842 to account for the lease and non-lease components together for existing classes of underlying assets and allocates the contract consideration to the lease component only. This practical expedient is not elected for manufacturing facilities and equipment embedded in product supply arrangements. Revenue Recognition The Company applies ASU 606, Revenue for Contracts from Customers , which amended revenue recognition principles and provides a single, comprehensive set of criteria for revenue recognition within and across all industries. The Company has not yet achieved commercial sales of its drug candidates to date, however, the new standard is applicable to its distribution agreements. The revenue standard provides a five-step framework for recognizing revenue as control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that it determines are within the scope of the revenue standard, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, the Company assesses whether the goods or services promised within each contract are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate performance obligation, or whether they are not distinct and are combined with other goods and services until a distinct bundle is identified. The Company then determines the transaction price, which typically includes upfront payments and any variable consideration that the Company determines is probable to not cause a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognizes the associated revenue when, or as, each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company s distribution agreements may entitle it to additional payments upon the achievement of milestones or shares of product revenue. The milestones are generally categorized into three types: development milestones, regulatory milestones and sales-based milestones. The Company evaluates whether it is probable that the consideration associated with each milestone or shared revenue payments will not be subject to a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. Amounts that meet this threshold are included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method, whereas amounts that do not meet this threshold are excluded from the transaction price until they meet this threshold. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized for its milestones and shared revenue payments, and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and net income (loss) in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss. Typically, milestone payments and shared revenue payments are achieved after the Company s performance obligations associated with the distribution agreements have been completed and after the customer has assumed responsibility for the respective clinical program. Milestones or shared revenue payments achieved after the Company s performance obligations have been completed are recognized as revenue in the period the milestone or shared revenue payments was achieved. If a milestone payment is achieved during the performance period, the milestone payment would be recognized as revenue to the extent performance had been completed at that point, and the remaining balance would be recorded as deferred revenue. The revenue standard requires the Company to assess whether a significant financing component exists in determining the transaction price. The Company performs this assessment at the onset of its distribution agreements. Typically, a significant financing component does not exist because the customer is paying for services in advance with an upfront payment. Additionally, future shared revenue payments are not substantially within the control of the Company or the customer. Whenever the Company determines that goods or services promised in a contract should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation over time, the Company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using either the proportional performance method or on a straight-line basis if efforts will be expended evenly over time. Percentage of completion of patient visits in clinical trials are used as the measure of performance. The Company feels this method of measurement to be the best depiction of the transfer of services and recognition of revenue. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. If the Company determines that the performance obligation is satisfied over time, any upfront payment received is initially recorded as deferred revenue on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. Certain judgments affect the application of the Company s revenue recognition policy. For example, the Company records short-term (less than one year) and long-term (over one year) deferred revenue based on its best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized. This estimate is based on the Company s current operating plan, and the Company may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next 12-month period if its plan changes in the future. Grant Income The determination as to when income is earned is dependent on the language in each specific grant. Generally, we recognize grant income in the period in which the expense is incurred for those expenses that are deemed reimbursable 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 under the terms of the grant. Grant income is due upon submission of reimbursement request. The transaction price varies for grant income based on the expenses incurred under the awards. CIRM Grant Award Capricor accounts for the disbursements under its CIRM Award as long-term liabilities. Capricor recognizes the CIRM grant disbursements as a liability as the principal is disbursed rather than recognizing the full amount of the grant award. After completing the CIRM funded research project and after the award period end date, Capricor has the right to convert the CIRM Award into a loan, the terms of which will be determined based on various factors, including the stage of the research and the stage of development at the time the election is made. In June 2016, Capricor entered into a Loan Election Agreement with CIRM whereby, among other things, CIRM and Capricor agreed that if Capricor elects to convert the grant into a loan, the term of the loan could be up to five years from the date of execution of the applicable loan agreement; provided that the maturity date of the loan will not surpass the ten-year anniversary of the grant date of the CIRM Award. Since Capricor may be required to repay some or all of the amounts awarded by CIRM, the Company accounts for this award as a liability rather than income. Research and Development Expenses and Accruals R D expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, supplies, clinical trial costs, patient treatment costs, rent for laboratories and manufacturing facilities, consulting fees, costs of personnel and supplies for manufacturing, costs of service providers for preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial activities, and certain legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution, stock compensation expense and other expenses relating to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our product candidates. Except for certain capitalized intangible assets, R D costs are expensed as incurred. Our cost accruals for clinical trials and other R D activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and contract research organizations CROs ), clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants or other clinical trial vendors that perform activities in connection with a trial. Related contracts vary significantly in length and may be for a fixed amount, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of fixed, variable and capped amounts. Activity levels are monitored through close communication with the CROs and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CRO and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. These estimates are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as necessary, and are included in R D expenses for the related period. For clinical study sites which are paid periodically on a per-subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter. All estimates may differ significantly from the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may occur several months after the related services were performed. In the normal course of business, we contract with third parties to perform various R D activities in the on-going development of our product candidates. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful enrollment of patients, and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions. The objective of the accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in the financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended. As such, expense accruals related to clinical trials and other R D activities are recognized based on our estimates of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the applicable contract. No adjustments for material changes in estimates have been recognized in any period presented.

 Stock-Based Compensation Our results include non-cash compensation expense as a result of the issuance of stock, stock options and warrants, as applicable. We have issued stock options to employees, directors and consultants under our five stock option plans: (i) the 2006 Stock Option Plan, (ii) the 2012 Restated Equity Incentive Plan (which superseded the 2006 Stock Option Plan), (the 2012 Plan ), (iii) the 2012 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (the 2012 Non-Employee Director Plan ), (iv) the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan ), and (v) the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan ). At this time, the Company only issues options under the 2020 Plan and the 2021 Plan and no longer issues options under the 2006 Stock Option Plan, the 2012 Plan, or the 2012 Non-Employee Director Plan. We expense the fair value of stock-based compensation over the vesting period. When more precise pricing data is unavailable, we determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This valuation model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation. These variables and assumptions include the weighted-average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding, the volatility of our common stock, and the risk-free interest rate. We account for forfeitures upon occurrence. Stock options or other equity instruments to non-employees (including consultants) issued as consideration for goods or services received by us are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company calculates the fair value for non-qualified options as of the date of grant and expenses over the applicable vesting periods. The terms and vesting schedules for share-based awards vary by type of grant and the employment status of the grantee. Generally, the awards vest based upon time-based conditions. Stock-based compensation expense is included in general and administrative expense or research and development expense, as applicable, in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). We expect to record additional non-cash compensation expense in the future, which may be significant. Clinical Trial Expense As part of the process of preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. Our clinical trial accrual process is designed to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, consultants, CROs and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements by matching the appropriate expenses with the period in which services are provided and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our condensed consolidated financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Our clinical trial accrual and prepaid assets are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from CROs and other third-party vendors. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. Recently Issued or Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. This standard was issued in response to the SEC s disclosure update and simplification initiative, which affects a variety of topics within the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected topics unless otherwise indicated. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC s 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures. Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC, did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statement presentation or disclosures. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Sensitivity Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately 85.0 million. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, Capricor s investment portfolio was classified as cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which consisted primarily of money market funds which included short-term U.S. treasuries, bank savings and checking accounts. The goal of our investment policy is to place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure. We seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. Our investments may be exposed to market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments, if any. We will manage this exposure by performing ongoing evaluations of our investments. Due to the short-term maturities, if any, of our investments to date, their carrying value has always approximated their fair value. Our policy is to mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities, and we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure. Due to our policy of making investments in U.S. treasury securities with primarily short-term maturities, we believe that the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
