and for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Intangible amortization expense amounted to and for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company estimates that intangible amortization expense will be approximately in 2024 and approximately declining to annually over the next five years. Indefinite-Lived Trade Names 

VMS impairment 

Net Carrying Value Trade Names 

The Company s indefinite-lived trade name impairment review is completed in the fourth quarter of each year. Fair value of indefinite-lived trade names was estimated based on a relief from royalty or excess earnings discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future. The key assumptions used in determining fair value are sales growth, profitability margins, tax rates, discount rates and royalty rates. The Company determined that the fair value of all indefinite-lived trade names for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to experience a decline in market share and a deterioration in the financial performance of its Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements ("VMS") business, which includes the VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS tradename, primarily due to significant product competition coming from new category entrants, including private label. The continued decline in profitability has caused management to reassess its long-term strategy and financial outlook of the business. The revised financial outlook reflects lower estimates of future sales growth and cash flows resulting in a triggering event in the third quarter. The triggering event requires the Company to review the carrying value of assets supporting the business. The assets supporting the VMS business include the VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS indefinite-lived trade name, a definite-lived customer relationship intangible asset and PP E specific to the VMS business. The Company used an excess earnings discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the trade name. The assumptions used in the model require significant judgement in determining the expected future cash flows. The key assumptions utilized in the Company's impairment analysis included, but were not limited, net sales growth rates between -15.2 and 2.1 , EBITA margins in the low single digits, and a discount rate of . Estimates are based on market conditions and management s current expectation of the success of growth and profitability initiatives. The valuation resulted in a full impairment of the tradename. The remaining carry value of the tradename at September 30, 2024 is . The Company also evaluated its ability to recover the carrying value of long-lived assets supporting the VMS business by comparing the carrying amount of those assets to the future undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the identified primary asset. The result of this evaluation was that the cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets requiring the Company to compare the carrying value of those assets to their fair value. The Company used an excess earnings discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets. The key assumptions utilized in the Company's impairment analysis included, but were not limited, net sales growth rates between -15.2 and 2.1 , EBITA margins in the low single digits, and a discount rate of . The valuation resulted in a fair value of the long-lived assets that is below their carry value requiring a pre-tax impairment charge of . The impairment charge was allocated to the PP E of the VMS business and to the remaining customer relationship intangible asset. The remaining carrying values of the PP E and the customer relationship intangible asset specific to the VMS business at September 30, 2024 are and , respectively.

Total VMS impairment charges 

The Company s global WATERPIK business has continued to experience a significant decline in customer demand for many of its products, primarily due to lower consumer spending for discretionary products from inflation and a growing number of water flosser consumers switching to more value-branded products. As a result, the WATERPIK business has experienced declining sales and profits resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows which have eroded a substantial portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the trade name. This indefinite-lived intangible asset may be susceptible to impairment and a continued decline in fair value could trigger a future impairment charge of the WATERPIK trade name. The carrying value of the WATERPIK trade name was and fair value represented of the carrying value as of October 1, 2023 (the date of the Company's last annual impairment test). The key assumptions used in the projections from the Company s October 1, 2023 impairment analysis include a discount rate of , revenue growth rates between 0 and 4.5 and EBITA margins between 19 and 26 . These assumptions were based on current market conditions as of the date of the impairment analysis, recent trends and management s expectation of the success of initiatives to lower costs and to develop lower-cost water flosser alternatives as well as improvement in the supply chain. While management has implemented strategies to address the risk, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair value. Due to the results of the Company's annual impairment test of the WATERPIK trade name, the Company monitors the performance of this business on at least a quarterly basis. Based on that review, the Company's expectations regarding the profitability of the global WATERPIK business has not substantially changed since the Company's last impairment test. Goodwill

The result of the Company s annual goodwill impairment test, performed in the second quarter of each year, determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units. The determination of fair value contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change and therefore could impact fair value in the future.

In 2015, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance program SCF Program ). Under the SCF Program, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the Company for early payment. Participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with a third party. The Company is not party to those agreements and do not have an economic interest in the suppliers' decisions to sell their receivables and has not been required to pledge any assets as security nor to provide any guarantee to third-party finance providers or intermediaries. The SCF Program may allow suppliers to obtain more favorable terms than they could secure on their own. The terms of the Company's payment obligations are not impacted by a supplier s participation in the SCF Program. The Company's payment terms with suppliers are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF Program and those that do not participate. As a result, the program does not have an impact to the Company's average days of payables outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, the obligations outstanding related to the SCF program amount to , recorded within Accounts Payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and payments included in operating activities within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care products and specialty products focused on animal and food production, chemicals and cleaners. Our well-recognized brands include ARM HAMMER baking soda, cat litter, laundry detergent, carpet deodorizer and other baking soda-based products; OXICLEAN stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergents and bleach alternatives; BATISTE dry shampoo; WATERPIK water flossers and showerheads; THERABREATH oral care products; HERO acne treatment products; VITAFUSION and L IL CRITTERS gummy dietary supplements for adults and children, respectively; TROJAN condoms, lubricants and vibrators; SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes; FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; NAIR depilatories; ORAJEL oral analgesic; XTRA laundry detergent; and ZICAM cold shortening and relief products. Seven of those brands are designated as "power brands" because they compete in large categories, and we believe they have the potential for significant global expansion. Those seven brands are ARM HAMMER OXICLEAN BATISTE WATERPIK THERABREATH HERO and VITAFUSION and L IL CRITTERS and represent approximately 70 of our net sales and profits. 
 We sell our consumer products through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar and other discount stores, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell our products to consumers. We sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and distributors. 
 We operate in three principal segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and our Specialty Products Division SPD ). 
 Recent Developments 
 In October 2021, members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD agreed to a global minimum tax rate of 15 . In December 2021, OECD published its model rules on the agreed minimum tax known as the Global Anti-Base Erosion GloBE or Pillar Two rules. The Pillar Two rules are designed to be implemented into the domestic law of each jurisdiction to ensure large multinational enterprise groups are subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15 in each jurisdiction where they operate. In December 2022, the European Union EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive. January 1, 2024 marked the official effective date of the 15 global corporate minimum tax imposed by the EU's Pillar Two Directive. We are monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts of the Pillar Two rules on our tax rate. We have evaluated the impact of the Pillar Two rules based on current legislation and available guidance, and do not anticipate a material impact to the Company. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we exited the MEGALAC supplement portion of our Animal Nutrition business within our SPD segment. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.0 and 8.1, respectively. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 7.6 and 29.7, respectively. 
 On June 3, 2024, we acquired substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Graphico, Inc. ("Graphico"), a Japan-based distributor focused on consumer goods primarily in the Japanese market (the Graphico Acquisition ). We paid 19.9, net of cash acquired, at closing. We acquired the remaining minority shares for approximately 2.0 in July 2024. Graphico s annual net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 were approximately 38.0. The Graphico Acquisition was financed with cash on hand, is expected to contribute to greater expansion of our business in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, and is managed in the Consumer International segment. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we sold our Passport food safety business, Passport Food Safety Solutions, Inc., with assets of 7.0, inclusive of intangible assets of 2.7 and corresponding goodwill of 1.0, for cash proceeds of 6.6 and 0.5 held in escrow 
 22 

for a gain of 0.1. Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.0 and 3.3, respectively. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.4 and 9.2, respectively. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we received a favorable tariff ruling from the U.S. government associated with certain products imported from China, which resulted in 37.6 of cash refunds (pre tax) in the nine months ended September 30,2024. The refunds resulted in a 3.2 and 29.3 reduction of Cost of goods sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in Interest income from interest of 4.6 during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued to experience a decline in market share and a deterioration in the financial performance for its Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements ("VMS") business, which includes the VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS tradename, primarily due to significant product competition coming from new category entrants, including private label. The continued decline in profitability has caused management to reassess its long-term strategy and financial outlook of the business. The revised financial outlook reflects lower estimates of future sales growth and cash flows resulting in a triggering event in the third quarter. The triggering event requires the Company to review the carrying value of assets supporting the business resulting in impairment charges of 357.1 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s 50 interest in The Armakleen Company was sold to an unrelated third party in October of 2024. The transaction is not material to the Company s results of operations or cash flows.

Gross Profit / Gross Margin 
 Our gross profit was 683.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 36.8 increase as compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin increased 80 basis points bps in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to the positive impact of productivity programs of 140 bps, favorable price/volume/mix of 130 bps, a favorable tariff ruling of 20 bps, and benefits from the Graphico Acquisition of 10 bps, offset by the impact of higher manufacturing costs, including labor and commodities, of 220 bps.

Gross margin increased 210 bps in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due to the impact of productivity programs of 130 bps, favorable price/volume/mix of 120 bps, and a favorable tariff ruling of 70 bps, offset by the impact of higher manufacturing costs including labor and higher commodities of 100 bps and unfavorable foreign exchange of 10 bps. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 185.8, an increase of 18.0 or 10.7 as compared to the same period in 2023. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 80 bps to 12.3 as compared to 11.5 in the same period in 2023 due to 120 bps on higher expense primarily from increased marketing spend to support new product introductions, offset by 40 bps of leverage on higher net sales. Marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 490.2, an increase of 67.9 or 16.1 as compared to the same period in 2023. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales for the first nine months of 2024 increased by 110 bps to 10.8 as compared to 9.7 in the same period in 2023 due to 150 bps on higher expense, primarily from increased marketing spend to support new product introductions, offset by 40 bps of leverage on higher net sales. 
 SG A expenses were 231.7 in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 9.0 or 4.0 as compared to the same period in 2023. SG A as a percentage of net sales was 15.3 in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023. SG A expenses were higher by 60 bps, primarily due to growth investments in our international division, Research and Development ("R D") and Information Technology ("IT"), and the Graphico acquisition, offset by 60 bps of leverage associated with higher sales. SG A expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were 684.5, an increase of 40.9 or 6.4 as compared to the same period in 2023. SG A as a percentage of net sales increased 30 bps to 15.1 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 14.8 in 2023 due to 90 bps on higher expenses, primarily due to growth investments in our international division, R D and IT, offset by 60 bps of leverage associated with higher sales. 
 Nonoperating Expenses 
 Tradename and other asset impairment charges were 357.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to non-cash charges to adjust the carrying value of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment related to the VMS business. The impairment was due to a continued decline in market share and a deterioration in the financial performance for the VMS business, which includes the VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS tradename, primarily due to significant product competition coming from new category entrants, including private label. See Note 11, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information. 
 25 

Interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.1 and 10.5 to 10.6 and 17.7, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, due to higher interest income primarily associated with the favorable Waterpik tariff ruling and higher interest rates . 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 3.8 and 12.3 to 23.4 and 71.6, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to lower average outstanding debt . 
 Other income (expense), net was nominal for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a benefit of 25.9 as compared to an expense of 24.1 in the same period in 2023. The effective tax benefit of 25.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the non-cash VMS impairment charge. Excluding the VMS impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.8 . 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.3 , compared to 22.1 in the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the non-cash VMS impairment charge. Excluding the VMS impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.6 which was higher than the 2023 rate due to a lower benefit from stock option exercises.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 On October 28, 2021, the Board authorized the Company's share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to 1,000.0 in shares of Common Stock (the 2021 Share Repurchase Program ). The 2021 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration and replaced the 2017 Share Repurchase Program. The 2021 Share Repurchase Program did not modify our evergreen share repurchase program, authorized by the Board on January 29, 2014, under which we may repurchase, from time to time, Common Stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of Common Stock under our incentive plans. There have been no stock repurchases in 2024 under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program. 
 
 On June 16, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement that provides for our 1,500.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility that matures on June 16, 2027, unless extended. We have the ability to increase our borrowing up to an additional 750.0, subject to lender commitments and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes and are used to support our 1,500.0 commercial paper program. 
 
 On January 31, 2024, the Board declared a 4 increase in the regular quarterly dividend from 0.2725 to 0.28375 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of 1.135 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of February 15, 2024. The increase raises the annual dividend payout from 267.0 to approximately 276.0 on an annualized basis. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we repaid the remaining 200.0 of our Term Loan due December 22, 2024 with cash on hand. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 752.1 in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately 1,495.0 available through the Revolving Credit Facility and our commercial paper program. To preserve our liquidity, we invest cash primarily in government money market funds, prime money market funds, short-term commercial paper and short-term bank deposits. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there remains 658.9 of share repurchase availability under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program. 
 
 The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for our liquidity. See Unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products under Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth. We do not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the Credit Agreement. We currently are, and anticipate that we will continue to be, in compliance with the interest coverage ratio requirement under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 We anticipate that our cash from operations, together with our current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to fund our share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management, pay debt and interest as it comes due, pay dividends at the latest approved rate, and meet our capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately 180.0 in 2024 primarily for manufacturing capacity investments in laundry and litter to support expected future sales growth. Cash, together with our current borrowing capacity, may be used for acquisitions that would complement our existing product lines or geographic markets.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Our primary source of liquidity is the cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on net income and changes in working capital. Our net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 68.8 to 863.9 as compared to 795.1 in the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in cash earnings (net income adjusted for non-cash items). We measure working capital effectiveness based on our cash conversion cycle. The following table presents our cash conversion cycle information for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Our cash conversion cycle (defined as the sum of DSO and DIO less DPO) which is calculated using a two-period average method, increased 2 days from the prior year. The increase in DSO is related to a reduction in our accounts receivable factoring program in response to higher interest rates. The decrease in DIO is a result of the timing of inventory purchases for most of our brands and a reduction in inventory purchases related to our discretionary brands. We continue to focus on reducing our working capital requirements. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 138.1, primarily reflecting 125.2 for property, plant and equipment additions and 19.9 for the Graphico Acquisition, partially offset by 6.6 of proceeds from the sale of assets. Net cash used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2023 was 128.4, primarily reflecting 121.5 property, plant and equipment additions.

Net cash used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2023 was 363.0, reflecting 199.9 of cash dividend payments and 270.6 of net debt repayments, partially offset by 107.6 of proceeds from stock option exercises.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Form 10-K, which could materially affect the Company s business, financial condition or future results, as well as the following update to our Risk Factors: 
 
 Impairment of our goodwill and other long-lived intangible and tangible assets may result in a reduction in net income. 
 
 We have a material amount of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets, as well as other long-lived tangible assets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards. Declines in our profitability and/or estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets, as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates, has resulted in impairment charges from time to time, and may result in future impairment charges. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded an impairment charge in connection with the FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS intangible assets. In the third quarter of 2024, due to continued decline in market share and a deterioration in the financial performance for Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business, which includes the VITAFUSION and L IL CRITTERS tradename, we reassessed our long-term strategy and financial outlook of the business. The revised financial outlook reflects lower estimates of future sales growth and cash flows resulting in a triggering event which required the Company to review the carrying value of long-lived assets supporting the business and resulted in impairment charges as discussed in more detail in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
