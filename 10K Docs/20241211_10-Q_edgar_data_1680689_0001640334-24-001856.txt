GENERAL We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 16, 2018. We were engaged in the business of selling beauty sample subscriptions. In December 2020, we acquired several gold mining claims in Canada as we have switched our focus to the mining industry. We planned to begin exploration on the properties.

On October 18, 2022, majority of the Company s shareholders approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of up to twenty (20) old shares for one (1) new share of common stock.

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 15 Table of Contents The following summary of our operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, which are included herein.

Going Concern The Company s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 2,481,896, and working capital deficit of 170,009 at October 31, 2024. The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company s cash position may not be sufficient to support the Company s daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the financial support from its major shareholder, Chief Executive Officer and the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 17 Table of Contents Plan of Operation and Funding We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next six months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of software; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavours or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. Our company s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
