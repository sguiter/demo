 life of the franchise contract, beginning on the start date of the contract. 
 Revenue from New and Renewal Royalty Fees is recorded by applying the sales- and usage-based royalties exception. Under the sales- and usage-based exception, the Company recognizes revenue over time as a franchise places and makes effective a policy for an insured. The transaction price for the royalty fee for each policy made effective is set as the contractual royalty rate multiplied by an estimate of the commissions to be received by the franchise for the current term of the policy. This estimate includes the fixed consideration due based on the contractual terms of the current policy and adjustments for estimates of modifications of the contractual terms of the current policy and/or termination of the policy before the end of the current term. This variable consideration is constrained to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. 
 Contract costs 
 Additionally, the Company has evaluated ASC Topic 340 - Other Assets and Deferred Cost ASC 340 which requires companies to defer certain incremental cost to obtain customer contracts, and certain costs to fulfill customer contracts. 
 Incremental cost to obtain - The Company defers certain costs to obtain customer contracts primarily as they relate to commission-based compensation plans for selling new franchise agreements. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a period, which is consistent with the term of the contract. The balance of cost to obtain is included with Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Costs to fulfill - The Company has evaluated the need to capitalize costs to fulfill customer contracts and has determined that there are no costs that meet the definition for capitalization under ASC 340.

 million compared to million at December 31, 2023. The primary contributing factors to the increase in deferred tax assets are additional redemptions of LLC Units of GF for shares of Class A common stock of GSHD during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in the blended state tax rate due to changes in state apportionment and related state filing requirements. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 GF intends to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the Code effective for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC Units and corresponding Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock occurs. Future taxable redemptions or exchanges are expected to result in tax basis adjustments to the assets of GF that will be allocated to the Company and thus produce favorable tax attributes. These tax attributes would not be available to GSHD in the absence of those transactions. The anticipated tax basis adjustments are expected to reduce the amount of tax that GSHD would otherwise be required to pay in the future. 
 GSHD entered into a tax receivable agreement ("TRA") with the Pre-IPO LLC Members on May 1, 2018 that provides for the payment by GSHD to the Pre-IPO LLC Members of of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that GSHD actually realizes as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in GSHD's assets and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the tax receivable agreement. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, an aggregate of and LLC Units were redeemed by the Pre-IPO LLC Members for newly issued shares of Class A common stock. In connection with these redemptions, GSHD received and LLC Units, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of its investment in GF subject to the provisions of the tax receivable agreement. The Company recognized a liability for the TRA Payments due to the Pre-IPO LLC Members, representing of the aggregate tax benefits the Company expects to realize from the tax basis increases related to the redemptions of LLC Units, after concluding it was probable that such TRA Payments would be paid based on its estimates of future taxable income. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of TRA Payments due to the Pre-IPO LLC Members under the tax receivable agreement was million, of which million was current and included in Liabilities under tax receivable agreement within Current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future exchanges of LLC Units for Class A common stock will result in additional TRA payments. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate increased due to changes in state apportionment and related state filing requirements. This resulted in a remeasurement of its TRA liability of million, which has been reported in "Other income (expense)" on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 Uncertain tax positions 
 GSHD has determined there are material uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024.

Certain income statement line items 
 Revenues 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, despite continued macroeconomic headwinds, primarily related to product availability, the condition of the housing market, and severe weather events that temporarily impacted our production in several large states, revenue increased by 10 to 78.0 million from 71.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased by 11 to 220.6 million from 198.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total Written Premium, which we believe is the best leading indicator of future revenue, increased to 1.03 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.80 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total Written Premium increased 29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.85 billion from 2.21 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total Written Premiums drive our current and future Core Revenue and give us potential opportunities to earn Ancillary Revenue in the form of Contingent Commissions. 
 Our various revenue streams do not equally contribute to the long-term value of Goosehead. For instance, Renewal Revenue and Renewal Royalty Fees are more predictable and have higher margin profiles, thus are higher quality revenue streams for the Company. Alternatively, Contingent Commissions, while high margin, are unpredictable and dependent on insurance company underwriting and forces of nature and thus are lower quality revenue for the Company. Our revenue streams can be viewed in three distinct categories: Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, and Ancillary Revenue, which are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, and Ancillary Revenue to total revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth under "Key performance indicators". 
 Core Revenue: 
 Renewal Commissions - highly predictable, higher-margin revenue stream, which is managed by our service team. 
 Renewal Royalty Fees - highly predictable, higher-margin revenue stream, which is managed by our service team. For policies in their first renewal term, we see an increase in our share of royalties from 20 to 50 on the commission paid by the Carriers. 
 New Business Commissions - predictable based on agent headcount and consistent ramp-up of agents, but lower margin than Renewal Commissions because of higher commissions paid to agents and higher back-office costs associated with policies in their first term. This revenue stream has predictably converted into higher-margin Renewal Commissions historically, and we expect this to continue moving forward. 
 New Business Royalty Fees - predictable based on franchise count and consistent ramp-up of franchises, but lower margin than Renewal Royalty Fees because the Company only receives a royalty fee of 20 on the commissions paid by the Carrier in the first term of every policy and incurs higher back-office costs associated with policies in their first term. This revenue stream has predictably converted into higher-margin Renewal Royalty Fees historically, and we expect this to continue moving forward. 
 Agency Fees - although predictable based on agent count, Agency Fees do not renew like New Business Commissions and Renewal Commissions. 
 
 Cost Recovery Revenue: 
 Initial Franchise Fees - one-time Cost Recovery Revenue stream per franchise unit that covers the Company's costs to recruit, train, onboard, and support the franchise for the first year. These fees are fully earned and non-refundable when a franchise attends our initial training. 
 Interest Income - like Initial Franchise Fees, interest income is a Cost Recovery Revenue stream that reimburses the Company for those franchises on a payment plan. 
 
 Ancillary Revenue: 
 Contingent Commissions - although high margin, Contingent Commissions are unpredictable and susceptible to weather events and Carrier underwriting results. Management does not rely on Contingent Commissions for operating cash flow or budget planning. 
 Other Franchise Revenues - book transfer fees, marketing investments from Carriers and other items that are unpredictable and supplemental to other revenue streams.

The following table sets forth these revenue streams by amount and as a percentage of total commissions and agency fees for the periods indicated in thousands ): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Core Revenue: Renewal Commissions 20,215 65 19,036 60 56,767 64 53,395 60 New Business Commissions 6,249 20 6,125 19 18,612 21 17,899 20 Agency Fees 1,989 6 2,008 6 6,036 7 6,642 8 Total Core Revenue: 28,453 92 27,169 85 81,415 92 77,936 88 Ancillary Revenue: Contingent Commissions 2,490 8 4,811 15 7,367 8 10,701 12 Commissions and agency fees 30,942 100 31,980 100 88,782 100 88,637 100 
 
 Renewal Commissions increased by 1.2 million, or 6 , to 20.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Renewal Commissions increased by 3.4 million, or 6 , to 56.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of policies in the renewal term from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and premium rate increases. 
 New Business Commissions increased by 0.1 million, or 2 , to 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. New Business Commissions increased by 0.7 million, or 4 , to 18.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in the number of Corporate sales agents. 
 Revenue from Agency Fees remained stable at 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from Agency Fees decreased by 0.6 million, or 9 , to 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Agency Fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of policies written where an Agency Fee was charged. 
 Revenue from Contingent Commissions decreased by 2.3 million to 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from Contingent Commissions decreased by 3.3 million, to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to additional profitability requirements in order to earn a contingent bonus.

Franchise revenues 
 Franchise Revenues consist of Royalty Fees, Initial Franchise Fees, and Other Franchise Revenues. 
 The following table sets forth these revenue streams by amount and as a percentage of franchise revenues for the periods indicated in thousands ): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Core Revenues: Renewal Royalty Fees 38,070 81 30,040 78 103,951 79 80,344 74 New Business Royalty Fees 6,994 15 5,910 15 20,396 16 17,819 16 Total Core Revenues: 45,064 96 35,950 93 124,348 95 98,163 90 Cost Recovery Revenues: Initial Franchise Fees 1,413 3 2,430 6 5,288 4 8,780 8 Ancillary Revenues: Other Franchise Revenues 385 1 349 1 1,440 1 1,547 2 Franchise revenues 46,862 100 38,729 100 131,076 100 108,490 100 
 
 Revenue from Renewal Royalty Fees increased by 8.0 million, or 27 , to 38.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 30.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from Renewal Royalty Fees increased by 23.6 million, or 29 , to 104.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 80.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue from Renewal Royalty Fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of policies in the renewal term and rising premium rates. 
 Revenue from New Business Royalty Fees increased by 1.1 million, or 18 , to 7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from New Business Royalty Fees increased by 2.6 million, or 14 , to 20.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue from New Business Royalty Fees during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in franchise productivity and rising premium rates. 
 Revenue from Initial Franchise Fees decreased by 1.0 million, or 42 , to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from Initial Franchise Fees decreased by 3.5 million, or 40 , to 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for this decrease was lower turnover of franchises during the period, which avoids accelerated recognition of Initial Franchise Fees for terminated franchises. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased by 0.1 million, or 28 , to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income decreased by 0.4 million, or 36 , to 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to fewer average Franchise Agreements signed under the payment plan option. 
 Expenses 
 Employee compensation and benefits 
 Employee compensation and benefits expenses increased by 3.8 million, or 10 , to 43.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 39.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Employee compensation and benefits expenses increased by 14.1 million, or 12 , to 127.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 113.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily related to investments in corporate producers, partnership, technology, and service functions, and increases in equity-based compensation of 10 and 11 for the three and nine month periods related to stock options awarded during the year. 
 31 

General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 0.4 million, or 2 , to 15.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on software offset by more efficient spend on travel and marketing. General and administrative expenses increased by 1.2 million, or 3 , to 49.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on software offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges and professional services. 
 Bad debts 
 Bad debts decreased by 0.2 million, or 29 , to 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Bad debts decreased by 1.0 million, or 30 , to 2.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to lower turnover of franchises during the periods. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 0.3 million, or 11 , to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization increased by 1.0 million, or 15 , to 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to increased spending on software development since September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased by 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 2.1 million from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased 0.5 million to 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an increase in total borrowings outstanding during the periods. 
 Other income (expense) 
 Other income (expense) consists of remeasurements of our TRA liability and interest income. Other income (expense) increased by 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of interest income generated by cash held in interest-bearing checking accounts. Other income (expense) decreased by 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to remeasurements of our TRA liability due to an increase in the effective tax rate resulting from changes in state apportionment and related state filing requirements. 
 Tax (benefit) expense 
 Tax expense increased by 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to 2.3 million from expense of 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in income before taxes. Tax (benefit) expense decreased by 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to a benefit of 3.3 million from expense of 2.9 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is primarily due to the deferred tax impact of changes in state apportionment and related state filing requirements.

Total Written Premium placed is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it reflects growth of our business relative to other insurance agencies. 
 The following tables show Total Written Premium placed by corporate agents and franchisees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) . 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Corporate sales Total Written Premium 203,988 182,483 12 Franchise sales Total Written Premium 824,748 620,456 33 Total Written Premium 1,028,736 802,939 28 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Corporate sales Total Written Premium 578,276 508,951 14 Franchise sales Total Written Premium 2,268,120 1,698,952 34 Total Written Premium 2,846,396 2,207,903 29 
 Policies in Force 
 Policies in Force means, as of any reported date, the total count of current (non-cancelled) policies placed by Goosehead with its portfolio of Carriers. We believe that Policies in Force is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it reflects growth of our business relative to other insurance agencies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.6 million Policies in Force compared to 1.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 1.5 million as of September 30, 2023, representing a 10 and 12 increase, respectively. 
 NPS 
 Net Promoter Score (NPS) is calculated based on a single question: How likely are you to refer Goosehead Insurance to a friend, family member or colleague? Clients that respond with a 6 or below are Detractors, a 
 score of 7 or 8 are called Passives, and a 9 or 10 are Promoters. NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. For example, if 50 of respondents were Promoters and 10 were Detractors, NPS is a 40. NPS is a useful gauge of the loyalty of client relationships and can be compared across companies and industries. 
 NPS has decreased to 90 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 92 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Client Retention 
 Client Retention is calculated by comparing the number of all clients that had at least one policy in force twelve months prior to the date of measurement and still have at least one policy in force at the date of measurement. We believe Client Retention is useful as a measure of how well Goosehead retains clients year-over-year and minimizes defections. 
 Client Retention decreased modestly to 84 at September 30, 2024 when compared to 86 at December 31, 2023 and 87 at September 30, 2023. For the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, we retained 99 of the premiums we distributed in the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023, which decreased modestly from the 101 premium retention at December 31, 2023. Our premium retention rate is higher than our Client Retention rate as a result of both premiums increasing year over year and additional coverages sold by our sales and service teams.

New Business Revenue 
 New Business Revenue is commissions received from the Carrier, Agency Fees received from clients, and New Business Royalty Fees from franchises relating to policies in their first term. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, New Business Revenue grew 8 to 15.2 million, from 14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, New Business Revenue grew 6 to 45.0 million, from 42.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Growth in New Business Revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by growth in Franchise productivity, an increase in the number of Corporate sales agents, and rising premium rates. 
 Renewal Revenue 
 Renewal Revenue is commissions received from the Carrier and Renewal Royalty Fees from franchises received after the first term of a policy. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Renewal Revenue grew 19 to 58.3 million, from 49.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Renewal Revenue grew 20 to 160.7 million, from 133.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Growth in Renewal Revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by Client Retention of 84 at September 30, 2024, and rising premium rates. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EPS are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for total revenue, net income, net income margin or earnings per share, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We refer to these measures as "non-GAAP financial measures." We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, tax position, depreciation, amortization and certain other items that we believe are not representative of our core business. Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EPS have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, or Adjusted EPS in isolation or as substitutes for total revenue, net income, earnings per share, as applicable, or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Core Revenue 
 Core Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Renewal Commissions, Renewal Royalty Fees, New Business Commissions, New Business Royalty Fees, and Agency Fees. We believe that Core Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes all of our revenues from sales of individual insurance policies. 
 Core Revenue increased by 10.4 million, or 16 , to 73.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 63.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Core Revenue increased by 29.7 million, or 17 , to 205.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 176.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the increase during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were more new policies written driven by an increase in Franchise productivity and the number of Corporate sales agents, a higher number of policies in the renewal term assisted by client retention of 84 , and rising premium rates. 
 34 

Cost Recovery Revenue 
 Cost Recovery Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Initial Franchise Fees and Interest Income. We believe that Cost Recovery Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are viewed by management as cost recovery mechanisms. 
 Cost Recovery Revenue decreased by 1.1 million, or 40 , to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the decrease was a decrease in total franchises. Cost Recovery Revenue decreased by 3.9 million, or 39 , to 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver was a decrease in terminations of franchises, resulting in less acceleration of initial franchise fee revenue. 
 Ancillary Revenue 
 Ancillary Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Contingent Commissions and Other Franchise Revenues. We believe that Ancillary Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are ancillary to our core business . 
 Ancillary Revenue decreased by 2.3 million to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Ancillary Revenue decreased by 3.4 million to 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to additional profitability requirements in order to earn a contingent bonus. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation, impairment expense, and other non-operating items, including, among other things, certain non-cash charges and certain non-recurring or non-operating gains or losses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA increased by 3.7 million, or 17 , to 26.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 22.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 6.9 million, or 12 , to 62.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 55.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the increase in Adjusted EBITDA during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was growth in Total Revenue. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as defined above, divided by total revenue excluding other non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is helpful in measuring profitability of operations on a consolidated level. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 34 compared to 32 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 28 compared to 28 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of maintaining growth in expenses in proportion to growth in Total Revenue. 
 Adjusted EPS 
 Adjusted EPS is a supplemental measure of our performance, defined as earnings per share (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EPS is a useful measure to management because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to business performance.

Calculated as equity-based compensation divided by sum of weighted average Class A and Class B shares [ 21.1 million/(24.7 million + 12.8 million)] for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and [ 19.0 million/ (23.7 million + 14.0 million)] for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (2) Calculated as impairment expense divided by sum of weighted average Class A and Class B shares [ 0.3 million/(24.7 million + 12.8 million)] for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Calculated as impairment expense divided by sum of weighted average Class A and Class B shares [ 3.6 million/(23.7 million + 14.0 million)] for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. No impairment was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Liquidity and capital resources 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 We have managed our historical liquidity and capital requirements primarily through the receipt of revenues. Our primary cash flow activities involve: (1) generating cash flow from Commissions and Fees, which largely includes New Business Commissions, Renewal Commissions, and Agency Fees; (2) generating cash flow from Franchise Revenues operations, which largely includes Initial Franchise Fees and Royalty Fees; (3) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under our credit agreement; and (4) issuing shares of Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 47.5 million. We have used cash flow from operations primarily to pay compensation and related expenses, general, administrative and other expenses, debt service, special dividends, share repurchases, and distributions to our owners. 
 Credit agreement 
 See "Note 8. Debt" in the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the Company's credit facilities.

Comparative cash flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 
 59,043 37,369 21,674 Net cash used for investing activities 
 (9,278) (14,609) 5,331 Net cash used for financing activities 
 (43,700) (16,086) (27,614) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 
 6,065 6,674 (609) Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 44,047 30,387 13,660 Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period 50,112 37,061 13,051 
 Operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 59.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 37.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a 7.0 million increase in net income, a 7.3 million decrease in cash paid for prepaid expenses, and a 6.5 million increase related to changes in contract liabilities as a result of fewer franchise terminations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used for investing activities of 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a 6.0 million decrease in purchases of books of business. 
 Financing activitie s 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 43.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net cash used for financing activities of 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by repurchases of our Class A common stock for 63.2 million offset by new borrowings under our term loan of 25.0 million and an 8.1 million decrease in repayments on our term loan. 
 Future sources and uses of liquidity 
 Our sources of liquidity are (1) cash on hand, (2) net working capital, (3) cash flows from operations and (4) our revolving credit facility. Based on our current expectations, we believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments in the foreseeable future. 
 We expect that our primary liquidity needs will comprise cash to (1) provide capital to facilitate the organic growth of our business, (2) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, (3) make payments under the tax receivable agreement, (4) pay interest and principal due on borrowings under our Credit Agreement (5) pay income taxes, (6) repurchase shares under our Share Repurchase Program, and (7) when deemed advisable by our board of directors, pay dividends. 
 Dividend policy 
 There have been no material changes to our dividend policy as described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Tax receivable agreement 
 We entered into a tax receivable agreement with the Pre-IPO LLC Members on May 1, 2018 that provides for the payment by us to the Pre-IPO LLC Members of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in Goosehead Insurance, Inc. s assets and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments 
 38 

made under the tax receivable agreement. See "Item 13. Certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Holders of Goosehead Financial, LLC Units (other than Goosehead Insurance, Inc.) may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions described above, redeem or exchange their LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock of Goosehead Insurance, Inc. on a one-for-one basis. Goosehead Financial, LLC intends to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the Code effective for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock occurs, which is expected to result in increases to the tax basis of the assets of Goosehead Financial, LLC at the time of a redemption or exchange of LLC Units. The redemptions or exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Goosehead Financial, LLC. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that Goosehead Insurance, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the Pre-IPO LLC Members that provides for the payment by us to the Pre-IPO LLC Members of 85 of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in Goosehead Insurance, Inc. s assets resulting from (a) the purchase of LLC Units from any of the Pre-IPO LLC Members using the net proceeds from any future offering, (b) redemptions or exchanges by the Pre-IPO LLC Members of LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock or (c) payments under the tax receivable agreement and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the tax receivable agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of Goosehead Insurance, Inc. and not of Goosehead Financial, LLC. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of Goosehead Insurance, Inc. (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that Goosehead Insurance, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of Goosehead Financial, LLC as a result of the redemptions or exchanges and had Goosehead Insurance, Inc. not entered into the tax receivable agreement. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the redemption or exchange, the extent to which such redemptions or exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income. See "Item 13. Certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. We anticipate that we will account for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the tax receivable agreement arising from future redemptions or exchanges as follows: 
 we will record an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the redemption or exchange; 
 to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and 
 we will record 85 of the estimated realizable tax benefit (which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under the tax receivable agreement and the remaining 15 of the estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to additional paid-in capital. 
 All of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the redemption or exchange will be included in net income. Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income.

 (1) The Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to monthly lease payments, the lease agreements require the Company to reimburse the lessors for its portion of operating costs each year. Rent expense was 1.8 million and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 5.6 million and 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 (2) The Company further amended its credit facilities on April 24, 2024 increasing term loan borrowings by 25 million and increasing the revolving credit facility by 25 million to 75 million, of which nothing was drawn as of September 30, 2024. See "Note 8. Debt" under Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 (3) Interest expense includes interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreement. Our debt obligations have variable interest rates. We have calculated future interest obligations based on the interest rate for our debt obligations as of September 30, 2024. 
 (4) See "Item 2. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation - Tax receivable agreement." 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On April 24, 2024, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to 100 million of our Class A common stock through March 31, 2025. See "Note 10. Stockholders' Equity" in the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the repurchase program. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 We do not invest in any off-balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support, or engage in any activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements except for those described under Contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies above. 

Critical accounting policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions, which we believe to be reasonable, based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Variances in the estimates or assumptions used to actual experience could yield materially different accounting results. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
