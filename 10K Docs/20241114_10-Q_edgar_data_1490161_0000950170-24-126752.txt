CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the safe harbor protection for forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords. 
 
 From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf may make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our company. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report regarding our financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations and industry conditions are forward-looking statements. When used in this report, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as estimate, project, predict, believe, expect, anticipate, target, plan, intend, seek, goal, will, should, may or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Items making assumptions regarding actual or potential future sales, market size, collaborations, trends or operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements. 
 
 Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements include the following: 
 our ability to compete successfully against competitors with significantly greater financial and relationship resources than us in the highly competitive industry in which we operate; 

our ability to maintain and enhance our brand; 

our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies related to launching new products; 

the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs; 

our ability to manage current operations and to manage future growth effectively; 

our future operating performance; 

our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers; 

our ability to protect and maintain our intellectual property; 

the government regulations to which we are subject; 

failure to obtain sufficient sales and distributions for our freeze dried product offerings; 

the potential for supply chain and shipping disruption and delay; 

the potential for transportation, labor, and raw material cost increases; and 

other risks and uncertainties included in our Risk Factors . 

In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. We have based these forward-looking statements and statements of belief on our current expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this report. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results in these statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. You should consider carefully the statements in Item 1A. Risk Factors and other sections of this report, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report, other than as may be required by applicable law or regulation. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in our reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected or projected.

After launching its freeze dried candy product line the Company discontinued its smoothie, snack and granola products. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company completed the construction of its second and third freeze driers and to facilitate the increased production demands for its candy products. The significant and rising demand for freeze dried candy products has led the Company to add a fourth freeze drier in the first quarter of 2024, a fifth freeze drier in the second quarter of 2024 and a sixth freeze drier, which was completed in the third quarter of 2024.

However, the Company will continue to monitor and adjust the historical loss rates to reflect the effects of current conditions and forecasted changes.

Item 2. Management s D iscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report. Certain statements in the discussion contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. 
 Overview and Outlook 
 Sow Good is a trailblazing U.S.-based freeze dried candy and snack manufacturer dedicated to providing consumers with innovative and explosively flavorful freeze dried treats. Sow Good has harnessed the power of our proprietary freeze drying technology and product-specialized manufacturing facility to transform traditional candy into a novel and exciting everyday confectioneries subcategory that we call freeze dried candy. We began commercializing our freeze dried candy products in the first quarter of 2023, and as of September 30, 2024, we have twenty-one stock keeping units SKUs in our Sow Good Candy line of treats and three SKUs in our Sow Good Crunch Cream line. We sell our treats using an omnichannel strategy primarily focused on the wholesale and retail channels with less than 2 of sales coming from e-commerce as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, our treats are offered for sale in over 6,000 brick-and-mortar retail outlets in the United States. The rapid demand growth for our delectable treats since their retail debut in March 2023 highlights our consumers excitement for our novel and explosively flavorful treats that satisfy your sweet tooth in fewer bites. 
 We have custom-built a 20,945 square foot freeze drying facility in Irving, Texas, and have entered into additional co-manufacturing arrangements in China and Colombia. Freeze drying removes up to 99 of moisture from a product in its frozen state by applying a small amount of heat in an extremely low air pressure, near outer space-like environment, through the use of massive vacuum chambers, resulting in moisture being removed from the product at the speed of sound. This process of removing moisture from the product, which can take up to twenty-four hours, concentrates its flavor, creating a hyper dried, hyper crunchy, and hyper flavorful snackable treat. Our commitment to providing the most flavorful and crunchy treats extends into the product packaging process, where our employees are dedicated to hand-packaging our treats through our precision packaging process in vigilantly managed low humidity conditions to protect our treats from reintroduction to moisture. 
 We have built six bespoke freeze driers using proprietary technology tailored specifically to our products which allows us to freeze dry up to 24 million units of freeze dried candy per year, creating a truly state-of-the-art facility in Irving, Texas. We have placed deposits on six additional freeze driers, which we aim to have operational within the next nine months in our new 324,000 square foot facility in Dallas, Texas. In addition, due to strong customer demand, we have entered into co-manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers whose freeze drying facilities meet our exacting production, sanitation and allergen control requirements, as well as our food quality and safety standards. Currently, all of our products manufactured by third parties are shipped to our facilities in Texas for packaging. 
 
 Sow Good, co-founded by Claudia and Ira Goldfarb, brings over a decade of manufacturing expertise to the CPG sector, specializing in advanced freeze-drying technology. With experience across pet, baby, and candy products, they have a proven track record of transforming niche trends into everyday consumer staples. Leveraging their proprietary technology, Sow Good aims to disrupt traditional categories, delivering innovative, high-quality products that emphasize long shelf life and natural preservation. Beyond product innovation, they are committed to job creation and positive community impact, making Sow Good a forward-thinking force in the industry. 
 We believe the candy category is stagnant, repetitive, and in need of revitalization to reengage and captivate consumers seeking innovative ways to satisfy their sweet cravings. We see our market opportunity existing at the intersection of two categories: the burgeoning freeze dried candy and non-chocolate confections. According to the NCA, the non-chocolate confections market grew 13.8 in sales in 2022, exceeding 10 billion, and according to Grand View Research is forecasted to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.8 from 2023 to 2030. We believe the nascent freeze dried candy market is poised for exponential growth given increasing consumer preferences for novel and distinctive candy products. According to the NCA, approximately 61 of shoppers occasionally or frequently seek out products they have never purchased before. 
 Our products have launched in retailers nationwide from convenience and grocery stores to big-box retailers, such as Five Below, Target, Misfits Market/Imperfect Foods, TJX Canada, Big Lots, Hy-Vee, Cracker Barrel, Circle K, 7/11, HEB Kroger and Albertsons. In addition, we sell a substantial portion of our products through distributors such as Redstone Foods, CB Distributors and Nassau Distributors. We believe there is a significant growth opportunity in increasing our shelf presence, SKU portfolio, and number of stores with our existing customers. For many of these customers, we launched with a limited number of SKUs, with those SKUs routinely outpacing initial sales projections. As we scale production, we will have the ability to increase the availability of our products 
 28 

to these customers in current locations and distribution to more of their stores, while also broadening our SKU portfolio offerings. Bolstering our distribution and sales force will be a key growth driver for Sow Good so more of our products are available wherever our consumers choose to shop, whether it be a retail store, convenience store, or directly online. To further support our retail launches with existing customers and strengthen our brand name, we are also introducing our product displays with distinctive designs and product highlights to enhance our visibility in current stores and educate new consumers on the advantages of freeze dried treats. We believe this strategy will capture the attention of new consumers, further educate and attract current consumers, and ultimately, increase sales for our retailers. 
 Our highly differentiated omnichannel distribution strategy has three key components: retailers, e-commerce, and distributors. In aggregate, this omnichannel strategy provides us with a diverse set of consumers and customer partners, leading to a larger total addressable market opportunity than is normally available to products sold only in grocery stores, along with an opportunity to develop a direct relationship with our customers at our website, www.thisissowgood.com and our social medial pages. 
 Key Factors Affecting our Performance 
 We believe the growth of our business and our future success is dependent upon many factors. While the factors and trends described below present significant opportunities for us, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address to enable us to sustain the growth of our business and improve our results of operations. These factors and trends in our business have driven fluctuations in revenues over the periods presented and are expected to be key drivers of our results of operations and liquidity position for the foreseeable future. 
 Ability to Compete Against Competitors with Greater Resources and Market Clout 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry against competitors with significantly greater financial and other resources. We have become aware of certain of our competitors using their market clout and marketing spend to limit our current and future customers from purchasing our products or reducing our shelf space. Our ability to keep our current customers, or grow our SKU portfolio on their shelves, and continue to expand our sales with new customers will depend on our competitors ability to leverage their market clout and financial resources to limit our access to consumers and our ability to compete with these larger competitors. 
 Ability to Grow Our Customer Base in Retail and Traditional Wholesale Distribution Channels 
 We are currently growing our customer base in a variety of physical retail and traditional wholesale distribution channels. Our products have launched in retailers nationwide from convenience and grocery stores to big-box retailers, such as Five Below, Target, Misfits Market/Imperfect Foods, TJX Canada, Big Lots, Hy-Vee, Cracker Barrel, Circle K, 7/11, HEB, Kroger and Albertsons. In addition, we sell a substantial portion of our products through distributors such as Redstone, CB Distributors and Nassau Distributors. We continue to increase our shelf presence, SKU portfolio and number of stores with existing customers. In addition, given the nascent state of the freeze dried candy segment and the number of potential retailer and wholesaler customers, we also believe there is a significant growth opportunity with customer acquisition in both the retail and wholesale channels, domestically and internationally. Customer acquisition in these channels depends on, among other things, our go-to-market function and our ability to meet the demand of customers who require large volumes of products. 
 Consumer Trends 
 We compete in the freeze dried candy and non-chocolate confections segments of the greater food industry. According to the NCA, the non-chocolate confections market grew 13.8 in sales in 2022, exceeding 10 billion, and according to Grand View Research is forecasted to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.8 from 2023 to 2030. We believe the nascent freeze dried candy market is poised for exponential growth given increasing consumer preferences for novel and distinctive candy products. According to the NCA, approximately 61 of shoppers occasionally or frequently seek out products they have never purchased before. While we believe our products are designed to provide alternatives for consumers looking for innovative treats, we also believe our candy products have broad appeal due to our uncompromising approach to developing a product line suited to a wide base of consumer tastes. We believe our ability to attract the robust and growing consumer base seeking the novel, crunchy and hyper flavorful experience our products provide will allow us to add distribution points with our retail customers and increase our revenues, which we believe will help us scale and increase our gross margin from sales of our products. 
 29 

Ability to Optimize Our Liquidity Position While Scaling 
 Our primary focus is developing our production capacity and our customer base, which requires significant working capital for inventory and supply chain management, capital expenditures for additional freeze driers, expansion outside the United States, and additional sales and marketing expenditures. Our ability to effectively manage our liquidity position while increasing production capabilities and marketing efforts will impact our cash flow and capitalization, including the need for additional working capital through future equity offerings or debt arrangements. 
 Ability to Expand Our Product Line 
 Our goal is to substantially expand our product line over time to increase our growth opportunity and reduce product-specific risks through SKU diversification into multiple products, including freeze dried products beyond our freeze dried treats. Our pace of growth will be partially affected by the cadence and magnitude of new product launches over time. We believe the commercialization of any new products will require us to hire additional employees within our product design and commercialization team, thereby increasing our marketing expense, as well as research and development costs within our administrative expense. 
 Impact of inflation on operations. 
 We expect supplies and prices of the ingredients that we are going to use to be affected by a variety of factors, such as weather, seasonal fluctuations, demand, politics and economics in the producing countries. These factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies, which could adversely affect our revenue and profits. In addition, we may face limits on the ability to source some of the candy for our freeze dried candy products. 
 Seasonality 
 Because we are early in our lifecycle of growth, it is difficult to discern the exact magnitude of seasonality affecting our business from a demand standpoint. While evidence of any demand seasonality is currently difficult to assess because of our growth, we anticipate certain holiday cycles such as Halloween, Christmas, Easter and Valentine s Day contributing to revenue fluctuations within a given year. In addition, we have become aware of external data showing a general trend in candy consumer behavior regarding reduced candy purchasing in summer months due to a variety of factors including greater levels of health consciousness during warm weather. Operationally, recent heat waves from July through October have presented challenges in transporting our freeze-dried treats. These conditions led to reduced shipments, higher inventory levels, and a decline in revenue. Additionally, some candy transported via external distribution channels during the extreme summer heat melted, impacting its shelf performance. We are actively working to remove affected products from shelves and replace them promptly to support recovery in product velocity. In the short term, these measures will impact our market reputation, sell-through rates, and operational results as we address these unforeseen challenges. We do anticipate a return to a normal cadence with the seasonal reduction in temperatures to a level where our treats can be shipped without damage. As a result, we anticipate an annual temporary decrease in shipments of our treats during summer months, which we believe is consistent with the greater candy industry trend. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We derive revenues from the sales of our freeze dried treats. The Company recognizes revenues when orders are shipped to customers. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of facilities costs, material costs, and labor on the production of freeze dried treats. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, which includes salaries and benefits expenses, professional services expenses and other general and administrative expenses, intangible asset impairment losses and goodwill impairment losses. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase as our business grows.

 Interest expense consists primarily of the cash interest expense on outstanding debt and the amortization of the debt discount created upon the issuance of warrants in connection with debt. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists primarily of the interest on short-term U.S Treasury Bonds.

 The Company recognized a federal income tax benefit of 62.3 thousand, and 0, for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized federal income tax of 195.6 thousand, and 0, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Segment Overview

Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues 
 Sales of freeze dried candy for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.6 million, compared to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.5 million, or (29 ), primarily driven by the Company s decision to delay the majority of shipments to customers as the extreme heat during the period was negatively impacting the quality of the candy shipments. In addition, revenue was affected by an increase in promotional activity and customer allowances. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.0 million, compared to 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 700.8 thousand, or (19 ). The decrease in cost of goods sold is primarily related to the decline in revenue partially offset by higher costs related to the company s new facility and a lower production yield. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 556.0 thousand, compared to gross profit of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 779.3 thousand, or 58 . Gross profit decreased over the comparative period due to decreased revenues of 1.5 million partially offset by lower cost of goods sold of 700.8 thousand. 
 
 Our gross profit margin was 16 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 27 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross profit margin decreased primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Salaries and Benefits 
 Salaries and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.9 million, compared to 618.9 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.3 million, or 203 . Salaries and benefits included stock-based compensation expense of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 111.5 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.0 million. Stock-based compensation consists of stock options expense for employees and officers of the Company. The increase in salaries and benefits was mainly due to the amortization of performance shares granted December 15, 2023. 
 Professional Services 
 General and administrative expenses related to professional services were 320.3 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 294.7 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 25.6 thousand, or 9 . The increase was primarily due to increased professional service expenses as the Company scaled up the business and invested in system and process improvements. 
 Other General and Administrative Expenses 
 Other general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.6 million, compared to 74.7 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.5 million, or 2052 . Other General and Administrative expense compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a 741.6 thousand increase in facilities costs to the extent they are not allocated to inventory related to the company s new facility, a 325.4 thousand increase in bad debt expense due to a customer bankruptcy versus a recovery of bad debt in the prior year period, and a 265.2 thousand increase in marketing and advertising costs. 
 Depreciation 
 Depreciation of property and equipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was 216.2 thousand and 150.7 thousand, of which 207.6 thousand and 141.4 thousand was allocated to cost of goods sold, which resulted in net depreciation expense of 8.6 thousand and 9.3 thousand, respectively. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, other expense consisted mainly of interest expense derived from notes payable and the amortization of warrants issued as a debt discount of 225.1 thousand. During the period ended September 30, 2023, interest expense on notes payable was a net credit of 3.6 thousand, due to adjustments to amortized interest during the three month period ended September 30, 2023. 
 32 

Net Income (Loss) 
 Pretax net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.4 million, compared to pretax net income of 334.0 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023, decrease in earnings of 3.8 million, or 1,131 . The transition to pretax net loss from pretax net income was primarily due the decrease in gross profit of 779.3 thousand, or 58 and increased operating expenses of 2.8 million or 282 . 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Company maintains a full valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets, primarily due to our historical net loss position. For the month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized federal income tax benefit of tax of 62.3 thousand and a provision of 0, respectively.

 Salaries and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.4 million, compared to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.9 million, or 338 . Salaries and benefits included stock-based compensation 
 33 

expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 3.3 million, compared to 307.4 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.0 million, or 939 , mainly due to the amortization of performance shares granted December 15, 2023. Other increases in salaries and benefits were cash bonuses of 850.0 thousand, and wages and payroll tax increases of 375.9 thousand over the comparative period, as a result of sales growth. 
 
 Professional services 
 
 Professional services were 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 404.3 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 978.1 thousand, or 242 . The increase was primarily due to an increase of 896.0 thousand in legal fees in connection with our underwritten public offering and Nasdaq listing and 263.0 thousand incurred in connection with the company growth, partially offset by a decrease of 180.0 thousand in other professional services costs. 
 
 Other general and administrative expenses 
 
 Other general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.9 million, compared to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.9 million, or 304 . The increase is primarily attributable to higher facilities and marketing costs driven by company growth. 
 
 Depreciation 
 
 Depreciation of property and equipment was 582.9 thousand and 306.1 thousand, of which and 559.9 thousand and 211.5 thousand was allocated to cost of goods sold, which resulted in net depreciation expense of 23.1 thousand and 94.6 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Other expense 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expense was 1.9 million, consisting of 1.2 million of interest expense on our notes payable and 696.5 thousand of loss on early extinguishment of debt. During the comparative nine months ended September 30, 2023, other expense was 1.3 million, consisting of interest expense on our notes payable. Interest expense decreased by 100.0 thousand or (8 ), due to full and partial repayments of notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt, and decreased the principal upon which stated interest is calculated. 
 
 Net income (loss) 
 
 Pretax net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 661.4 thousand, compared to a pretax net loss of 4.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a positive change of 5.0 million. The increased net income was due primarily to higher revenues coupled with increased margins. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Company maintains a full valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets, primarily due to our historical net loss position. For each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized federal income tax of 195,603, and 0, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 19.7 million, compared to working capital of 4.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increased working capital is mainly attributable to increases in cash of 4.5 million, accounts receivable of 1.3 million, and inventory of 15.3 million, partially offset by the increase in the current portion of our lease liability of 1.6 million, and accrued expenses of 1.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, our balance of cash and cash equivalents was 6.9 million, compared to 2.4 million at December 31, 2023. We expect to continue to incur significant capital expenditures related to the development and operation of our freeze dried candy business. Our ability to scale production and distribution capabilities and further increase the value of our brands is largely dependent on our success in deploying additional capital. Our plan for satisfying our cash requirements for the next twelve months is through cash on hand and additional financing in the form of equity or debt as needed. 
 On May 2, 2024 we priced a registered underwritten public offering of 1,200,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 10.00 per share. On May 9, the underwriters exercised an overallotment option for the purchase of an additional 180,000 shares of our common stock. Together with the sale of the additional shares sold pursuant to the overallotment option, the offering netted approximately 12.0 million in proceeds, after underwriting discounts and offering costs.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. 
 
 Our critical accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the footnotes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, and Note 2 of the footnotes to the financial statements provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 3. Quanti tative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We do not expect any significant effects from commodity price risk outside of inherent inflationary risks. 
 37 

Interest Rate Risk 
 We are not a party to agreements that subject us to floating rates of interest and do not anticipate entering into any transactions that would expose us to any direct interest rate risk. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We did not hold a material amount of cash in foreign jurisdictions as of September 30, 2024. However, we anticipate that as our foreign operations grow, we may hold more cash in foreign jurisdictions, particularly Mexico, Colombia and China, and possibly expose ourselves to greater currency fluctuation risk than we currently experience. 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures. 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on their evaluations as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer, Claudia Goldfarb, and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Brendon Fischer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to accomplish their objectives and to ensure the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 38 

PART II OTHER INFO RMATION 
 Item 1. Lega l Proceedings. 
 From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various types of legal proceedings. We do not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Risk F actors. 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in the Company. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC. 
 We have a limited operating history in our current form and have incurred significant operating losses. As a result of continuing investments to expand our business, we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 

Our rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and our limited operating history may make it difficult to assess our future viability. 

We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy. 

We have previously identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting for our financial year ended December 31, 2022. If we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations and investors may lose confidence in our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 

The retail food and non-chocolate confectionary and freeze dried candy segments are highly competitive. If new entrants with greater resources continue to take market share, or our competitors are more successful or offer better value to consumers, our business could decline. 

Failure to maintain sufficient internal production capacity, source appropriate external production capacity, or to enter into third-party agreements on terms that are beneficial for us may result in our inability to meet customer demand and/or may increase our operating costs and capital expenditures. 

Loss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth. 

We rely on a small number of suppliers to provide our raw materials for certain of our treats, and our supply chain may be interrupted and prevent us from obtaining the necessary materials we need to operate. 

Consumer preferences for our products, or for freeze dried candy generally could change rapidly, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends, our business may be adversely affected. 

Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results. 

Fluctuations in various food and supply, transportation and shipping costs could adversely affect our operating results. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology adequately, which may impact our commercial success. 

Food safety concerns and concerns about the health risk of our products may have an adverse effect on our business. 

Our ability to maintain and expand our distribution network and attract consumers, customers, distributors, retailers and brokers will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. 

39 

Our success depends in part on the effectiveness of our digital marketing strategy and the expansion of our social media presence, but there are risks associated with these efforts. 

Failure to manage inventory at optimal levels could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Information security events, or real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our systems; other technology disruptions; or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to information security could negatively impact our business, our reputation and our relationships with customers. 

Our international sales and operations, including our planned business development activities outside of the United States, subject us to additional risks and challenges that can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S., and in any other jurisdictions in which we may sell our products, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all laws and regulations. 

The market price of our common stock is, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. 

We have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 

We are a smaller reporting company, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters. 

Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel, including Ira and Claudia Goldfarb, our Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, respectively, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services. 

A worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy. 

The failure to successfully integrate newly acquired products or businesses could negatively impact our profitability. 

Risks Related to Our Operating History, Financial Position and Capital Needs 
 We have a limited operating history in our current form and have incurred significant operating losses. As a result of continuing investments to expand our business, we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 
 Sow Good was formed and commenced commercial sales of our products in 2021, and in 2023 we started producing and commercializing our freeze dried candy treats, including our Sow Good freeze dried candy line and our Crunch Cream line. On October 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of S-FDF, LLC (the Seller ), a Texas limited liability company, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, between the Company and the Seller, dated June 9, 2020, as subsequently amended effective October 1, 2020 (the Asset Purchase Agreement ). The assets we purchased under the Asset Purchase Agreement were of a development stage business without any major customers or history of operations upon which to forecast future business trends. As a result, we have a limited operating history and limited experience manufacturing and selling our products, establishing relationships with consumers, customers, suppliers, vendors and distributors and building our brand reputation. These and other factors combine to make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast our future operating results, which in turn makes it more difficult for us to prepare accurate budgets and implement strategic plans. We expect that this uncertainty will continue to exist in our business for the foreseeable future. If we do not address these risks and uncertainties successfully, our operating results could differ materially from our estimates and forecasts, and from the expectations of investors or analysts, which could harm our business and result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock. 
 As a developing company, we will need to adopt and implement a plan to increase awareness of our products, secure distribution channels, and foster and strengthen our supply, manufacturing and distribution relationships. It is likely our strategic priorities will need to evolve over time and our business would be materially and adversely affected if we do not properly adapt our 
 40 

strategies to our changing needs and changes in the market. As our operations develop and grow, we expect to experience significant increases in our working capital requirements. Even if we obtain additional capital and achieve profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability and our failure to do so would adversely affect the Company s business, including our ability to raise additional funds. 
 In the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of approximately 3.1 million and 12.1 million, respectively. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net losses of approximately 3.4 million, as compared to a net income of 334.0 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2023. We anticipate our operating expenses and capital expenditures will increase in the foreseeable future as we seek to expand our retail distribution, invest in our approach to build brand awareness, leverage our product development capabilities, and invest in production capacity and automation. As a result of our continuing investments to expand our business in these and other areas, we expect our expenses to increase, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the foreseeable future. Even if we are successful in broadening our consumer base, and increasing revenues from new and existing customers, we may not be able to generate additional revenues in amounts that are sufficient to cover our expenses. We may incur significant losses for a number of reasons, including as a result of the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this filing. We cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve profitability in the future or that we will sustain profitability over any particular period of time. 
 We may need additional funding in order to fund our existing commercial operations, commercialize new products and grow our business. 
 To date, we have financed our operations through public offerings and private placements of our equity, equity-linked and debt securities. We have devoted substantially all our financial resources and efforts to developing our products, workforce, and manufacturing capabilities. Our long-term growth and success are dependent upon our ability ultimately to expand our manufacturing capacity and generate cash from operating activities. There is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations or access the capital we need to grow our business. Our inability to obtain additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fully implement our business plan as described herein and grow our business, to a greater extent than we can with our existing financial resources. 
 If our available cash balances, net proceeds from anticipated offerings/or anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements because of lower demand for our products or due to other risks described herein, we may seek to sell common stock or other securities, enter into an additional credit facility or seek another form of third-party funding, including debt financing. The amount of additional capital we may require, the timing of our capital needs and the availability of financing to fund those needs will depend on a number of factors, including our strategic initiatives and operating plans, the performance of our business and the market conditions for debt or equity financing. Although we believe various debt and equity financing alternatives will be available to us to support our working capital needs, financing arrangements on acceptable terms may not be available to us when needed. Additionally, these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders. Any such financing alternatives may not provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long-term capital requirements. 
 We may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to: 
 provide for additional capacity; 

increase our sales and marketing efforts and address competitive developments; 

provide for supply and inventory costs; 

fund development and marketing efforts of any future products, geographic expansion or additional features to then-current products; 

acquire, license or invest in new technologies; 

acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and 

finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses. 

Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 41 

our ability to achieve revenue growth and improve gross margins; 

the cost of expanding our operations and offerings, including our sales and marketing efforts; 

the effect of competing market developments including new market entrants with greater resources; and 

costs related to international expansion. 

The various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of shares of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of shares of our common stock. The terms of any debt securities issued or borrowings made pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. 
 Our rapid growth may not be indicative of our future growth, and our limited operating history may make it difficult to assess our future viability. 
 Our revenues grew from approximately 88.4 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately 428.1 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately 16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 30.6 million and 6.5 million, respectively. We expect that, in the future, as our revenue increases to higher levels, our revenue growth rate will decline. We also believe that growth of our revenue depends on several factors, including our ability to: 
 expand our production capacity; 

increase awareness of our brand; 

expand our existing channels of distribution; 

develop additional channels of distribution; 

keep existing customers 

grow our customer base; 

cost-effectively increase online sales at our direct website and third-party marketplaces; 

effectively introduce new products; 

manufacture at a scale that satisfies future demand; and 

effectively source key raw materials. 

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, we may face increased competition from current or new competitors that may reduce our market share and thereby limit our growth. Since the initial commercialization of our freeze dried candy treats in March 2023, we have not yet demonstrated the ability to sustain rapid growth over a long period of time or achieve profitability at scale. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or had previously achieved profitability. 
 We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy. 
 Our strategy envisions the expansion of our business. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our rapid growth has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including manufacturing operations, quality control, shipping, technical support and customer service, sales force management and general and financial administration. We must continue to refine and expand our 
 42 

business capabilities, including in sales, marketing, product development, information technology, equipment, facilities and personnel, as well as our systems and processes and our access to financing sources. We will also need to improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. As we grow, we must continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. 
 We cannot assure that we will be able to: 
 meet our capital needs; 

expand our systems effectively or efficiently or in a timely manner; 

allocate our human resources optimally; 

identify and engage qualified employees and consultants, or retain valued employees and consultants; or 

incorporate effectively the components of any business that we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth. 

If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. Managing our planned growth effectively will require us to: 
 maintain a low cost of customer acquisition relative to customer lifetime value; 

identify products that will be viewed favorably by customers; 

enhance our facilities and purchase additional equipment at our facility in Irving, Texas; and 

successfully hire, train and motivate additional employees, including additional personnel for our production, sales and marketing efforts and our finance and accounting functions. 

The expansion of our products and customer base may result in increases in our overhead and selling expenses. Any increase in expenditures in anticipation of future sales that do not materialize would adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our products may suffer and we may be unable to address competitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations and financial condition. 
 We have previously identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting for our financial year ended December 31, 2022. If we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations and investors may lose confidence in our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management believed that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective based on those criteria. As a small company with limited resources that is mainly focused on the development and sales of our freeze dried treats, the Company did not employ a sufficient number of staff in its finance department to possess an optimal segregation of duties or to provide optimal levels of oversight. This resulted in certain audit adjustments and management believed that there may be a possibility for a material misstatement to occur in future periods while it employed the current number of personnel in its finance department. 
 To address and fully remediate this material weakness, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Additionally, our remediation efforts for this material weakness included the hiring of additional staff members in our accounting and finance departments in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, management considered this material weakness fully remediated. 
 As a public company, we are required to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including, among other things, maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We continue to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in 
 43 

the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers. 
 We must continue to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Once we are no longer considered to be a smaller reporting company, our management will then be required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(a), and we may in the future be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with these requirements within the prescribed time period, we will be engaging in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. There is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed time period or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
 We cannot assure you that there are not, and will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 The retail food and non-chocolate confectionary and freeze dried candy segments are highly competitive. If new entrants with greater resources continue to take market share, or our competitors are more successful or offer better value to consumers, our business could decline. 
 We operate in a very competitive environment that is characterized by competition from a number of other retailers in the market in which we operate. We compete with large national and regional food retail companies, some of which have greater financial and operational resources than us, and with smaller local retailers, some of which may have lower administrative costs than us. We have become aware of certain significantly larger competitors using their market clout and marketing spend to limit our current and future customers from purchasing our products or reducing our shelf space. Our ability to keep our current customers, or grow our SKU portfolio on their shelves, and continue to expand our sales with new customers will depend on our competitors ability to leverage their market clout and financial resources to limit our access to consumers and our ability to compete with these larger competitors. In addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to large national and regional competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours. Any changes in our competitors merchandising and operational strategies could negatively affect our sales and profitability. In particular, if competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we would likely be forced to reduce our prices on similar product offerings in order to remain competitive, which may result in a decrease in our market share, revenues and profitability and may require a change in our operating strategies. 
 Increased competition could hurt our business. The freeze dried candy is fragmented and in its early stages of development, but it is becoming increasingly competitive. New competitors may enter the freeze dried candy market on which we are focused. The competitors may offer an equivalent or superior product to that of the Company. We expect the number of companies offering products and services in our market segment to continue to increase. 
 If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in any of our markets. Our inability to continue to compete successfully in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Failure to maintain sufficient internal production capacity, source appropriate external production capacity, or to enter into third-party agreements on terms that are beneficial for us may result in our inability to meet customer demand and/or may increase our operating costs and capital expenditures. 
 44 

We intend to rely on internal production capacity and third-party co-manufacturers to fulfill our growing production needs and meet demand for our treats. We have plans to continue to expand our own production facilities, including the production of our own candy for freeze drying, but in the short-term may need to increase our reliance on third parties to provide production and supply certain services for a number of our products. A failure by us or our co-manufacturers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations, or to produce products of the quality and taste-profile we expect, or with efficiency and at costs we expect, may also disrupt our supply of products. In addition, we may experience increased distribution and warehousing costs due to capacity constraints resulting from our growth and the need for refrigerated shipping solutions. If we need to enter into additional co-manufacturing or distribution agreements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find acceptable third-party providers or enter into agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, we will likely need to expand our internal capacity, which could increase our operating costs and could require significant capital expenditures. If we cannot maintain sufficient and satisfactory production, warehousing and distribution capacity, either internally or through third party agreements, we may be unable to meet customer demand and/or our manufacturing, distribution and warehousing costs may increase, which could negatively affect our business. 
 Loss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth. 
 We have historically relied, and will likely in the future, rely on international co-manufacturers to provide us with a portion of our production capacity. The terms of these co-manufacturing agreements vary, and some of these arrangements are short-term or based on purchase orders. Volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the product s life cycle, product promotions, alternative production capacity, and other factors, none of which are under our direct control. Any of the co-manufacturers with whom we do not have a written contract could seek to alter or terminate its relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. If we need to replace a co-manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional capacity will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. 
 An interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, production disruptions, product quality issues, local economic and political conditions, restrictive governmental actions, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), the outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, severe weather, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured. 
 We believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to continue to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, we will need to further develop relationships with co-manufacturers overseas to meet sales demand, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully do so. Therefore, the loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or delay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products, product extensions and expanded operations could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We rely on a small number of suppliers to provide our raw materials for certain of our treats, and our supply chain may be interrupted and prevent us from obtaining the necessary materials we need to operate. 
 We rely on suppliers and vendors to meet our high-quality standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner. There is, however, no assurance that quality ingredients will continue to be available to meet our specific and growing needs. This may be due to, among other reasons, problems with our suppliers and vendors businesses, finances, labor relations, ability to export or import materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as disease outbreaks or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, flooding or other catastrophic occurrences. If for any reason our suppliers or vendors became unable or unwilling to continue to provide services to us, this would likely lead to an interruption in our ability to import our products until we found another source that could provide these services. Failure to find a suitable replacement, even on a temporary basis, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our current production targets, make it difficult to grow and would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, three key suppliers, Redstone Foods, Albanese and Jiangsu Shengifan Foodstuff accounted for approximately 61 of our total raw material and packaging purchases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our top three suppliers accounted for 76 and 69 , respectively, of our purchases from vendors. Additionally, we do not have any contractual obligations for the continued supply of raw material and packaging from these key suppliers. As a result 
 45 

of this concentration in our supply chain, our business and operations would be negatively affected if any of our key suppliers were to experience significant disruption affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of their products. While we have not had supply chain disruptions to date, and believe that we can quickly find additional sources for our raw material and packaging, in the event that our supply from our current suppliers is interrupted, our operations may be interrupted in the interim resulting in lost revenue, added costs such as, without limitation, shipping costs, and distribution delays that could harm our business and customer relationships until we are able to identify one or more alternative suppliers. 
 The challenges of competing with other non-chocolate confectionary businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins. 
 The retail food industry is very competitive, and particularly so in the non-chocolate confectionary segment. We compete with many companies on the basis of taste, quality and price of product offered, and customer service. Our success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our products and our ability to develop new items that appeal to a broad range of consumers. Shifts in consumer preferences away from products like ours, our inability to develop new items that appeal to a broad range of consumers, or changes in our offerings that eliminate products popular with some consumers could harm our business. In addition, aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our revenue and operating margins by forcing us to reduce our prices on similar product offerings in order to remain competitive. We have become aware of at least one large multinational competitors using its market clout and marketing spend to limit our current and future customers from purchasing our products or reducing our shelf space. We also compete with other employers in our markets for workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of such competition. Recently there has been a significant increase in labor costs. 
 We have been able to compete successfully by differentiating ourselves from our competitors by providing an expanding selection of freeze dried treats, competitive pricing and convenience. If changes in consumer preferences decrease the competitive advantage attributable to these factors, or if we fail to otherwise positively differentiate our product offering or customer experience from our competitors, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Many of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources and larger customer bases than we do. These factors allow our competitors to derive greater revenues and profits from their existing customer bases, push us off of shelves as a result of exclusivity arrangements or threats related to marketing spend reductions, acquire customers at lower costs or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer preferences or habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies (including but not limited to predatory pricing policies and the provision of substantial discounts), which may allow them to build larger customer bases, limit our customer base, or generate revenues from those customer bases more effectively than we are able to execute upon. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these competitors. 
 We expect competition in the non-chocolate confectionary and freeze dried candy segments generally to continue to increase. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in this market depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including: 
 the size and composition of our customer base; 

the number of products that we feature on our website; 

the quality and responsiveness of customer service; 

our selling and marketing efforts; 

the quality and price of the products that we offer; 

the convenience of the shopping experience that we provide; 

our ability to distribute our products and manage our operations; and 

our reputation and brand strength. 

46 

Given the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regional economies generally and the food and beverage industry, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our success will depend on our ability to respond to, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, laws and regulations, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and our operational performance. 
 If we fail to compete successfully in this market, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 
 Consumer preferences for our products, or for freeze dried candy generally could change rapidly, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends, our business may be adversely affected. 
 Our business is currently focused on the development, manufacture, marketing, and sale of freeze dried treats. Consumer preferences, and therefore demand for our products, could change rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including consumer demand for specific nutritional content, dietary habits, or restrictions, including perceptions regarding food quality, concerns regarding the health effects of certain ingredients or macronutrient ratios, shifts in preferences for product attributes, laws and regulations governing product claims, brand reputation and loyalty, and product pricing. Further, freeze dried candy as a market entrant is in its nascent stage and may not see wide-spread acceptance. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products, or towards competitive products, could limit our product sales, reduce our market share, and negatively impact our brand reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 As is typical in a rapidly evolving industry, the development process and demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. Because the market for our products is new and evolving, it is difficult to predict with any certainty the size of this market and its growth rate, if any, and costs of manufacturing as a product is developed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing new or existing products or manufacturing new products, that our products will perform as expected, or that a market for our products will develop or that demand for our products will be sustainable. If we fail to develop or manufacture new products, or the market for new products fails to develop, develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors, our business, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected. 
 If we fail to grow the value and enhance the visibility of our brand, our business could suffer. 
 While we believe we have a strong brand reputation, a key component of our growth strategy involves growing the value and enhancing the visibility of our Sow Good brand. Our ability to maintain, position and enhance our brand will depend on a number of factors, including the market acceptance of our current and future product offerings, the nutritional content of our products, food quality and safety, quality assurance, our advertising and marketing efforts, and our ability to build relationships with customers and consumers. Any negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could materially adversely affect our business. Brand value is often based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our customers, suppliers, or consumers, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and harm our business. 
 Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results. 
 Maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by, among other things, issues with the quality of our products, any failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental sustainability practices for our operations, the views of management and other stakeholders, our impact on the environment, public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies, consumer perceptions of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs, including opportunities we choose to forego due to management philosophy, consumer perceptions of our use of social media, or consumer perceptions of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents or other third-parties. Operationally, recent heat waves from July through October in the third quarter of 2024 have presented challenges in transporting our freeze-dried treats. These conditions led to reduced shipments, higher inventory levels, and a decline in revenue. Additionally, some candy transported via external distribution channels during the extreme summer heat melted, impacting its shelf performance. We are actively working to remove affected products from shelves and replace them promptly to support recovery in product velocity. In the short term, these measures will impact our market reputation, sell-through rates, and operational results as we address these unforeseen challenges. 
 In addition, negative publicity, including as a result of the social or political views of our management, employees, customers or vendors, or misconduct by our consumers, customers, vendors or employees, can also spread rapidly through social media. Should we not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity, our brand and reputation may be significantly 
 47 

harmed. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild or repair our reputation. 
 Fluctuations in various food and supply, transportation and shipping costs could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Supplies and prices of the ingredients that we are going to use to may be affected by a variety of factors, such as weather conditions (including the effects of climate change), natural disasters, seasonal fluctuations, demand, politics and economics in the production areas. These factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies, which could adversely affect our revenue and profits. 
 We rely on our suppliers to meet our quality standards and to supply ingredients and other products in a timely and safe manner, and in accordance with our product specifications. We have developed and implemented a series of measures to ensure the safety and quality of our third-party supplied products, including using contract specifications, certificates of analysis for some products or ingredients, sample testing by suppliers, and sensory based testing. However, no safety and quality measures can eliminate the possibility that suppliers may provide us with products that are inconsistent with our specifications, below our quality standards, improperly labeled, or unsafe for consumption. If this was to occur, in addition to the risks associated with negative customer and consumer experiences, we could face the possible seizure or recall of our products, or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business. 
 In addition, the price of candy, which is currently our main ingredient in our products, can be volatile. The candy of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis, depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase. Further, we intend to begin production of our own candy as feedstock in the near term. An increase in pricing of any candy or candy production ingredients that we are going to use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to secure our candy or candy ingredient supplies. 
 In addition, our costs are affected by general inflationary pressures related to transportation and shipping costs, particularly to the extent we have additional retail sales and smaller order quantities. As we move toward more refrigerated shipping solutions to mitigate the impact of extreme heat on our product quality, we will incur additional shipping expense. Such inflationary pressures could be passed on to the customer and could cause the price of our products to increase, which may impact the attractiveness of our freeze dried treats relative to other candy or snack options with cost sensitive consumers. We are also subject to a reduction in our profitability due to increased labor costs for our employees. As we look to expand our distribution and market, we may not be able to increase our sales prices to absorb these costs. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain profitability consistent with our goals. As we plan for the acquisition of additional freeze driers, we also anticipate that the costs for this equipment will be more than as well as the lead time to receive the equipment once ordered will be longer than we have planned. This could increase our capital needs and also delay our ability to ramp up production in a timely manner to correspond to demand. 
 In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard, film, and plastic to package our products. The costs of these products may also fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in the competitive environment, availability of substitute materials, and macroeconomic conditions. If we are not successful in managing our raw material and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to fully or partially offset the increased costs, or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such cost increases will adversely affect our operating results. 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology adequately, which may impact our commercial success. 
 We believe that our intellectual property and proprietary technology has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, and trademarks laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our intellectual property or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. 
 Our trademarks, including our Sow Good logo, are valuable assets that reinforce our brand and consumers favorable perception of our products. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, and other trade secrets and copyright protection to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our continued success depends in part upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property. 
 Our confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, independent contractors and suppliers generally require that all information made known to them be kept strictly confidential. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information and may not provide an adequate 
 48 

remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. Further, some of our manufacturing know-how and process has been implemented by or with our co-manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from using similar processes, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we have not historically obtained confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements from all employees and consultants, which could impact our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. 
 We cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future, or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect customers or consumers perception of our brand and products. In addition, if we do not keep our trade secrets confidential, others may produce products with our recipes or formulations. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liability, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property, or force us to enter into licenses with others. 
 Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. 
 Our commercial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize our products without infringing the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. However, from time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business with respect to intellectual property. Intellectual property disputes can be costly to defend and may cause our business, operating results, and financial condition to suffer. Whether merited or not, we may face allegations that we or parties indemnified by us have infringed or otherwise violated the patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. 
 It may also be necessary for us to initiate litigation to defend ourselves in order to determine the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or to establish our respective rights. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have merit, such claims can be time-consuming, divert management s attention and financial resources, and can be costly to evaluate and defend. Results of any such litigation are difficult to predict and may require us to stop commercializing or using our products, obtain licenses, modify our products while we develop non-infringing substitutes, or incur substantial damages, settlement costs, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products. If we require a third-party license, it may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, and we may have to pay substantial royalties, upfront fees, or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products and solutions. We may also have to redesign our products so they do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time, during which our products may not be available for commercialization or use. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not obtain a third-party license to the infringed intellectual property, license the intellectual property on reasonable terms, or obtain similar intellectual property from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted. 
 Further, some third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. And even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Moreover, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. Assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Food safety concerns and concerns about the health risk of our products may have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Food safety is a top priority for us, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe and high-quality treats. However, foodborne illnesses and other food safety issues have occurred in the retail food industry in the past and could occur in the future. Also, our reliance on third-party food suppliers, distributors and food delivery aggregators increases the risk that foodborne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control. A failure or perceived failure to meet our quality or safety standards, including product adulteration, contamination, or tampering, or allegations of mislabeling, whether actual or 
 49 

perceived, could occur in our operations or those of our co-manufacturers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in time consuming and expensive production interruptions, negative publicity, the destruction of product inventory, the discontinuation of sales or our relationships with such co-manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers, lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time and higher-than-anticipated rates of returns of goods. The occurrence of health-related illnesses or other incidents related to the consumption of our products, including allergies, excessive consumption or death to a consumer, could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. 
 Noncompliance with applicable food product quality and safety regulations can limit our ability to access certain markets or result in enforcement action by applicable regulatory agencies, including product recalls, market withdrawals, product seizures, warning letters, injunctions, or criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid by us, which would affect our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, negative publicity also could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. The occurrence of foodborne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain, significantly increase costs and/or lower margins for us. 
 In addition, there is increasing consumer awareness of, and increased media coverage on, the alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products globally. Our products contain fats, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. An unfavorable report on the health effects of certain compounds present in our products, or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity, could significantly reduce the demand for our products. Additionally, there may be new laws and regulations that could impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our product offerings, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our product offerings or otherwise restrict sales of our treats. A decrease in consumer traffic as a result of these health concerns, laws or regulations or negative publicity could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 Product liability exposure may subject us to significant liability. 
 We may face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other claims and lawsuits in the event that the development or use of our products is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects. The sale of products for human use and consumption involves the risk of injury or illness to consumers. Such injuries may result from inadvertent mislabeling, tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination or spoilage. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to recall or withdraw products, suspend production of our products, or cease operations, which may lead to a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, customers may stop placing or cancel orders for such products as a result of such events. 
 Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall or market withdrawal, product liability claims might be asserted against us. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities and those of our co-manufacturers and suppliers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, if the consumption of any of our products causes, or is alleged to have caused, a health-related illness or death to a consumer, we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could cause consumers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this type might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. Although we maintain product liability and product recall insurance in an amount that we believe to be consistent with market practice, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 We have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may store or prepare our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions or store our products for longer than approved periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. 
 Although we believe our insurance coverage to be adequate and consistent with industry practice, we may not have sufficient insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost. An inability to obtain product liability insurance at acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products. Further, any claim under our insurance policies may be subject to certain exceptions, may not be honored fully, in a timely manner, or at all, and we may not have purchased sufficient insurance to cover all losses incurred. If we were to incur substantial liabilities or if our business operations were interrupted for a substantial period, we could incur costs and 
 50 

suffer losses. Inventory, equipment, and business interruption losses may not be covered by our insurance policies. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available to us at commercially acceptable premiums in the future, or at all. 
 Overall, we may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure. A product liability claim could hurt our financial performance. Even if we ultimately avoid financial liability for this type of exposure, we may incur significant costs in defending ourselves that could hurt our financial performance and condition. 
 Our ability to maintain and expand our distribution network and attract consumers, customers, distributors, retailers and brokers will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. 
 We sell a substantial portion of our products through retailers such as Five Below, Target, Misfits Market/Imperfect Foods, TJX Canada, Big Lots, Hy-Vee, Cracker Barrel, and Circle K, and distributors such as Redstone Foods, CB Distributors and Alpine Foods, and online through our website. The largest four purchasers of our products for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 accounted for approximately 72.7 of our revenues for that period. 
 The loss of, or business disruption at, one or more of these retailers or distributors or a negative change in our relationship with one of our key retailers or a disruption to any one of our sales channels could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have become aware of certain larger competitors using their market clout and marketing spend to limit certain of our key retailers from purchasing our products or reducing our shelf space. If we do not effectively compete with this larger competitors, maintain our relationship with existing retailers and distributors or develop relationships with new retailers and distributors, the growth of our business may be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed. 
 In addition, we may not be able to successfully manage all or any of the following factors in any of our current or prospective geographic areas of distribution: 
 the level of demand for our brands and product types; 

our ability to price our products at levels competitive with those of competing products; and 

our ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by consumers, distributors, retailers and brokers. 

Our inability to achieve success with regards to any of these factors in a geographic distribution area will have a material adverse effect on our relationships in that particular geographic area, thus limiting our ability to maintain or expand our market, which will likely adversely affect our revenues and financial results. 
 Further, if we are required to obtain additional or alternative distribution agreements or arrangements with our distributors or retailers in the future, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Our inability to enter into satisfactory distribution agreements may inhibit our ability to implement our business plan or to establish markets necessary to expand the distribution of our products successfully. 
 Our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us. 
 Most of our customers are retailers or distributors that buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products. We cannot provide assurance that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base. Decreases in our customers sales volumes or orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, our results of operations and our growth could be adversely affected. 
 Labor is a significant component of the cost of operating our business. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors, such as employment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, union activities, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees from our competitors and other industries, higher employee-turnover rates, or increases in the federal- or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated 
 51 

with health insurance coverage or workers compensation insurance), our operating expenses could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our success depends in part on the effectiveness of our digital marketing strategy and the expansion of our social media presence, but there are risks associated with these efforts. 
 Our digital marketing strategy is integral to our business, as well as to the achievement of our growth strategies. Maintaining, positioning, and enhancing our brand will depend in part on the success of our marketing efforts. As part of these efforts, we rely on social media and other digital marketing to retain customers, attract new customers and consumers to our brand, and enhance the overall visibility of our brand in the market. However, there are a variety of risks associated with these efforts, including the potential for negative comments about or incidents involving us, whether or not accurate, as well as the potential for the improper disclosure of proprietary information about us or consumers. In addition, there is a risk of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission FTC ), or other government agency, or other litigation claiming that our marketing does not meet applicable legal requirements or guidance, is not truthful, is misleading, or is unfair or deceptive to consumers. Further, the growing use of social and digital media may increase the speed and extent that information, or misinformation, and opinions about us and our products can be shared. For example, many social media platforms immediately publish content created or uploaded by their participants, often without filters or checks regarding the accuracy of the content posted. Negative publicity about us, our brand or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brand and reputation, as well as our significant social media presence. In addition, the misuse of social media and digital marketing platforms by us, our employees, customers, consumers, social media influencers, or business partners could increase our costs, lead to litigation, or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation. If we do not maintain and enhance the favorable perception of our brand, we may not be able to increase product sales, which could prevent us from achieving our strategic objectives. 
 Any failure to adequately store, maintain and deliver our products could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Our ability to adequately store, maintain, and deliver our products is critical to our business. Keeping our food products at specific temperatures and humidity levels maintains food safety and quality. In the event of extended power outages, labor disruptions, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences, failures of the refrigeration systems in our third-party delivery trucks, or other circumstances, our inability to store inventory at appropriate temperatures and low humidity could result in significant product inventory losses, as well as increased risk of food-borne illnesses and other food safety incidents. Improper handling or storage of food by a customer, without any involvement or fault of ours or our retail customers, could result in food-borne illnesses, which could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand and reputation. Any failure to adequately store, maintain, or transport our products could negatively impact the safety, quality and merchantability of our products and the experience of our customers. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Failure to manage inventory at optimal levels could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are required to manage a large volume of inventory of products effectively for our business. We depend on our forecasts for the anticipated demand for our products to make procurement plans and manage our inventory. Our forecast for demand, however, may not accurately reflect the actual market demands, which depends on a number of factors including, without limitation, launches of new products, changes in product life cycles and pricing, product defects, changes in consumer spending patterns, supplier back orders and other supplier-related issues, distributors and retailers procurement plans, as well as the volatile economic environment in the markets where we sell our products. In addition, when we launch a new product with new components or raw material, it may be difficult to establish relationships, determine appropriate raw material and product selection, and accurately forecast market demand for such product. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain proper inventory levels for our business at all times, and any such failure may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Inventory levels in excess of distributor and/or consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs or an increase in inventory holding costs and a potential negative effect on our liquidity. For example, as of September 30, 2024, our inventory grew to 19.4 million, relative to our cash and cash equivalents of 6.0 million, primarily as a result of our decision to halt shipping of our products during the third quarter and the beginning of October. As we plan to continue expanding our product offerings, we expect to include more products in our inventory, which will make it more challenging for us to manage our inventory effectively and will put more pressure on our storing system. If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may be subject to a heightened risk of inventory obsolescence, a decline in inventory values, and significant inventory write-downs or write-offs. In addition, we may be required to lower sale prices in order to reduce inventory level, which may lead to lower gross margins. High inventory levels may also require us to commit substantial capital resources, preventing us from using that capital for other important purposes. Any of the above may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 52 

Conversely, if we underestimate distributor or consumer demand, or if our supplier fails to provide products to us in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may, in turn, require us to purchase our products at higher costs, result in unfulfilled product orders, leading to a negative impact on our financial condition and our relationships with distributors or consumers. Under-stocking can lead to missed sales opportunities, while over-stocking could result in inventory depreciation and decreased shelf space for products that are in higher demand. These results could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Information security events, or real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our systems; other technology disruptions; or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to information security could negatively impact our business, our reputation and our relationships with customers. 
 Our continued success depends in part on our systems, applications, and software continuing to operate to meet our business demands. We rely on information technology systems and infrastructure for substantially all aspects of our business operations. We use mobile applications, social networking, and other online activities to connect with our customers, consumers, suppliers, and employees. Our business involves the storage and transmission of confidential information and intellectual property, including information pertaining to customers, consumers, vendors, distributors, and suppliers, and employees. We also may maintain financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. Further, as we pursue new initiatives that enhance our operations and cost structure, potentially including acquisitions, we may also be required to expand and improve our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. Like all technology and information systems, such use gives rise to cybersecurity risks, including security incidents, espionage, system disruption through material errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs, particularly when new features or capabilities are released, theft, and inadvertent release of information. Our technology and information systems may be subject to computer viruses or malicious code, break-ins, phishing impersonation attacks, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks, ransomware, and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized access or use of our computer systems, as well as unintentional incidents causing data leakage, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, or website or mobile app shutdowns. Electronic security attacks designed to gain access to personal, sensitive, or confidential data are constantly evolving, and such attacks continue to grow in sophistication. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives or acquisitions, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. 
 While we have implemented measures designed to prevent security incidents and cyber attacks, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, misuse, or release of sensitive or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, reputational harm, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, and liability, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally, as a result of a security incident, we could be subject to demands, claims, and litigation by private parties and investigations, related actions, and penalties by regulatory authorities. Moreover, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of laws and regulations relating to the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, use, or disclosure of personal information. 
 Further, our operations depend on the continuing and efficient operation of our information technology, communications systems and infrastructure, and on cloud-based platforms, including platforms operated by vendors. Any of these systems and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, vandalism, sabotage, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other deliberate attempts to harm the systems. The occurrence of a natural or intentional disaster, any decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice, or particularly an unanticipated problem at a cloud- based virtual server facility, could result in harmful interruptions in our service, resulting in adverse effects to our business. Although we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurances that our efforts will protect us against significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems, or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, operations, or financial condition of the company. 
 Our collection, use, and disclosure of information, including personal information, is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy and security regulations and binding industry standards; new or changed regulations could impose significant costs to our operation and failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm. 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state and local rules and regulations relating to the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosure, use, and security of personal information and other data. We also are or may in the future be subject to contractual obligations to protect data. We strive to comply with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and our own policies pertaining to the processing of personal information. Nevertheless, such laws, regulations, and other obligations may require us to change our business practices and may negatively impact our ability to expand our business and pursue business opportunities. We may incur significant 
 53 

expenses to comply with the laws, regulations, and other obligations that apply to us. Additionally, the privacy- and data protection-related laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Further, new laws, rules, and regulations could be enacted with which we are not familiar or with which our practices do not comply. 
 Several U.S. jurisdictions have passed omnibus privacy laws that apply to us now or may apply in the future as we grow and expand, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. Examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA ), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, CPRA ). Since the passage of the CCPA, more than ten (10) U.S. states have enacted omnibus privacy laws, which will go into effect at varying dates through 2026. The CCPA and other state omnibus laws provide consumers with substantial rights over their personal information, impose notice obligations on companies, and require companies to implement programs to manage such rights. As Company operates in the business-to-business space, Company will not be directly subject to the majority of the enacted state omnibus privacy laws. Nonetheless, to the extent that certain of these laws are applicable to us, and to the extent that other states enact laws in the future that are or may be applicable to us, we will need to expend resources to evaluate such regulations and implement compliance solutions. If we engage in email marketing or certain telemarketing activities, we will be subject to issue-specific laws pertaining to the use of information, including laws on marketing and advertising, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, and their state counterparts. 
 Further, if our operations bring us into the scope of non-U.S. privacy and data protection regulations, we may be subject to additional privacy and data protection regulations, which may require us to spend resources to comply with such programs and expose us to risk for any actual or perceived failure to comply. 
 We also are or may be subject to binding industry standards, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI-DSS ), due to our acceptance of payment cards. If we or our payment processors fail to comply with the PCI-DSS, we may incur significant fines or liability and lose access to major payment card systems. Industry groups may in the future adopt additional self-regulatory standards by which we are legally or contractually bound. 
 Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or data protection laws, policies, or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release of personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security incident, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our international sales and operations, including our planned business development activities outside of the United States, subject us to additional risks and challenges that can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 As part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to expand our international operations and manufacturing capacity, and provide our treats in additional languages and on-board new customers outside the U.S. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to conduct business and sell our treats may not be receptive to our business development activities. We believe that our ability to attract new customers is directly correlated to the level of engagement we achieve with our customers in their home countries. To the extent that we are unable to effectively engage with non-U.S. customers, we may be unable to effectively grow in international markets. 
 Our international operations also subject us to a variety of additional risks and challenges, including: 
 increased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having operations and developing our business in multiple jurisdictions; 

reformulating our treats to meet ingredients requirements of foreign jurisdictions; 

providing our treats and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages, among different cultures and time zones, including the potential need to modify our marketing and products to ensure that they are culturally appropriate and relevant in different countries; 

54 

compliance with non-U.S. data privacy, protection and security laws, rules and regulations, including data localization requirements, and the risks and costs of non-compliance; 

legislative changes that may impose fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligations; 

longer payment cycles and difficulties enforcing agreements, collecting accounts receivable or satisfying revenue recognition criteria, especially in emerging markets; 

hiring, training, motivating and retaining highly-qualified personnel, while maintaining our unique corporate culture; 

increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; 

longer sales cycles; 

requirements or preferences for domestic products; 

differing technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality; 

orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services; 

political and economic conditions and uncertainty in each country or region in which we operate and general economic and political conditions and uncertainty around the world; 

changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions; 

compliance with laws and regulations for non-U.S. operations, including anti-bribery laws, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our treats and develop our business in certain non-U.S. markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance; 

heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact our financial condition and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements; 

heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact our financial condition and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements; 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related effects on our results of operations; 

difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries; 

communication and integration problems related to entering new markets with different languages, cultures and political systems; 

new and different sources of competition; 

differing labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries; 

the need for localized subscription agreements; 

the need for localized language support and difficulties associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English; 

increased reliance on channel partners; 

55 

reduced protection for intellectual property rights in certain non-U.S. countries and practical difficulties of obtaining, maintaining, protecting and enforcing such rights abroad; and 

compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding tax obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes. 

Any of these risks and challenges could adversely affect our operations, reduce our revenue or increase our operating costs, each of which could adversely affect our ability to expand our business outside of the United States and thereby our business more generally, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. 
 Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations substantially increases our cost of doing business. We may be unable to keep current with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. or other regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or our policies by our employees, contractors, partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, other collateral consequences and increased costs, including the costs associated with defending against such actions, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our treats, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment 
 Our operations are subject to regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S., and in any other jurisdictions in which we may sell our products, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all laws and regulations. 
 Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and in any other jurisdictions in which we may sell our products. Specifically, for products manufactured or sold in the U.S., we are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act FDCA and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, ingredients, packaging, labeling, and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventative controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices GMPs ), and supplier verification requirements. Our co-manufacturers prepare and package freeze dried candies per our specifications at their processing facilities and are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state, and local authorities. If our products are not manufactured, processed, packaged and labeled in conformity with our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we or our co-manufacturers may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products or result in a recall of our product, that have already been distributed. If the FDA or another regulatory authority determines that we or our suppliers or other business partners have not complied with applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be adversely impacted. 
 We seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations through expert personnel with experience to ensure quality-assurance compliance and contracting with third-party laboratories that conduct analyses of new products to establish nutrition labeling information and to help identify certain potential contaminants before distribution. Our existing compliance structures may be insufficient to address the current or changing regulatory environment. This may result in gaps in compliance coverage or the omission of necessary new compliance activity. The failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or maintain permits, licenses, or registrations relating to our or their operations, could subject us to civil remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, warning letters, or restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and reputational harm. In addition, changes to laws, regulations, or policies applicable to foods could leave us vulnerable to adverse governmental action and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Even inadvertent, non-negligent or unknowing violations of federal, state, or local regulatory requirements could expose us to adverse governmental action and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 The FDCA, which governs the shipment of foods in interstate commerce, generally does not distinguish between intentional and unknowing, non-negligent violations of the law s requirements. Most state and local laws operate similarly. Consequently, almost any deviation from subjective or objective requirements of the FDCA, or applicable state or local laws, leaves us vulnerable to a 
 56 

variety of administrative actions, enforcement actions, and/or civil and criminal penalties. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 We may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to meet any listing standards or if we violate any listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. A delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market may materially impair our stockholders ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. The delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment. 
 The market price of our common stock is, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. 
 The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to: 
 dilution caused by our issuance of additional shares of common stock and other forms of equity securities, which we expect to make in connection with future capital financings to fund our operations and growth, to attract and retain valuable personnel and in connection with future strategic partnerships with other companies; 

quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses as we commence our production and sales; 

changes in the valuation of similarly situated companies, both in our industry and in other industries sales; 

challenges associated with timely SEC filings; 

changes in analysts estimates affecting our company, our competitors and/or our industry; 

changes in the accounting methods used in or otherwise affecting our industry; 

additions and departures of key personnel; 

fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of capital in the capital markets; 

significant sales of our common stock following the registration of shares; 

any guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in this guidance, or our failure to meet this guidance; 

announcements of new products by us or our competitors, and competition from new or existing products; 

addition or loss of significant customers, suppliers or other business partners; 

new laws or regulations applicable to our business or products, or changes to the interpretation of existing laws or regulations; 

announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or joint ventures by us or our competitors; 

outcome of litigation, regulatory matters, enforcement actions, or other disputes that may arise; and 

general economic, industry, and market conditions. 

These and other factors are largely beyond our control, and the impact of these risks, singly or in the aggregate, may result in material adverse changes to the market price of our common stock and our results of operations and financial condition. 
 57 

Further, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the trading prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. 
 In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the trading of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. 
 We have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings if any, to service debt, fund growth, develop our business, fund working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment in our common stock. 
 Future sales and issuances of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. 
 In the future, we may sell shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock, in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. We also expect to issue additional shares of our common stock to directors, officers, employees, and consultants pursuant to our equity incentive plans. If we sell shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock, in subsequent transactions, or if shares of our common stock are issued pursuant to our equity incentive plans, investors may be materially diluted. In addition, new investors in such subsequent transactions could receive securities with rights senior to those of holders of our common stock. 
 We are a smaller reporting company, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 We are a smaller reporting company under applicable SEC rules, meaning that the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million and our annual revenue was less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million, or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates was less than 700.0 million. As a smaller reporting company, we have chosen to present only the two most recent years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we have taken advantage of reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, period-to-period comparisons of our results may not be meaningful, and these fluctuations may cause the price of our common stock to decline. 
 Our quarterly results, including our revenues, operating expenses, operating margins, and profitability, may fluctuate significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be viewed as a prediction or indication of our future performance. In addition, our quarterly results may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. 
 Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results include, but are not limited to: 
 our inability to retain our existing customers, and expand sales of our products to our existing customers; 

our ability to attract new customers and consumers to our brand, the type and amount of products purchased, and the cost of acquisition; 

the mix of our products sold during the period, and the gross margins associated with those sales; 

changes in our pricing policies, or those of our competitors; 

58 

the amount and timing of discounts, rebates, or promotional activity; 

the amount and timing of costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of manufacturing capacity, distribution channels, production capabilities, and operational infrastructure; 

the amount and timing of costs and operating expenses associated with developing and commercializing new products; 

the amount and timing of costs and operating expenses related to the acquisition of businesses, assets, technologies, or intellectual property rights; 

the timing and impact of any security breaches, service outages or other performance problems with our technology infrastructure and software solutions; 

the timing and costs associated with legal or regulatory actions; 

changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including innovation or consolidation among customers, suppliers, or competitors; 

loss of our executive officers or other key employees; 

trends and conditions impacting the consumer packaged goods industry, and the freeze dried goods category in particular; 

the impacts and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreak, or similar widespread public health concern on our business and operating results, or incidence of disease; 

the effects of global events, such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, on our business and the global economy; and 

general economic, political, social, and market conditions, including inflationary pressures. 

Fluctuations in quarterly results, or for any other period, may negatively impact the value of our common stock, regardless of whether they impact or reflect the overall performance of our business. If our quarterly results, or results for any other period, fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock, or below any guidance we may provide, the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially. 
 Risks Related to Accounting and Tax Matters 
 Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us in the various tax jurisdictions to which we are subject could increase the costs of our products and harm our operating results. 
 New income, sales, use, or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Those enactments could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us. These events could require us to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us to pay fines, and penalties, and interest for past amounts deemed to be due, any of which would harm our operating results. 
 Changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices may require us to restate our reported financial results or harm our operating results. 
 GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Adoption of such new standards and any difficulties in the implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could lead to regulatory enforcement actions, cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reports, and result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock. 
 General Risks 
 59 

The conflict in the Middle East between Israel and its adversaries, including Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, may affect our operations. 
 A portion of our sales come from Israel, and because of this our business and operations are directly affected by economic, political, geopolitical and military conditions in Israel. 
 Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have occurred between Israel and its neighboring countries and terrorist organizations active in the region. These conflicts have involved missile strikes, hostile infiltrations and terrorism against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, which have negatively affected business conditions in Israel. 
 During the summer of 2006, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite militia group and political party. In December 2008 and January 2009 there was an escalation in violence among Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and other groups, as well as extensive hostilities along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip, which resulted in missiles being fired from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel. During November 2012 and from July through August 2014, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with a militia group and political party who controls the Gaza Strip, which resulted in missiles being fired from the Gaza Strip into Southern Israel, as well as at areas more centrally located near Tel Aviv and at areas surrounding Jerusalem. On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. Moreover, the clash between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. 
 Any hostilities involving Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations or could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. The conflict situation in Israel could also cause disruptions in our supply chain and international trade, including the export of our products. The conflict situation in Israel could also result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. 
 It is currently not possible to predict the duration or severity of the ongoing conflict or its effects on our business, operations and financial conditions. The ongoing conflict is rapidly evolving and developing, and could disrupt our business and operations in Israel or hamper our ability to raise additional funds, among others. 
 Our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel, including Ira and Claudia Goldfarb, our Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, respectively, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services . 
 Our future success heavily depends on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, especially the continued contributions of Ira and Claudia Goldfarb, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively, whose knowledge, leadership and technical expertise would be difficult to replace. Our executive officers or key personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty. In addition, we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. If one or more of our senior executives is unable or unwilling to continue to work for us in the present position, we may have to spend a considerable amount of time and resources searching, recruiting, and integrating a replacement into our operations, which would substantially divert management s attention from our business and severely disrupt our business. This may also adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy. 
 A worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy. 
 Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. There is no certainty regarding economic conditions in the United States, and credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions could deteriorate at any time. Accordingly, we may experience declines in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty. In addition, sustained periods of inflation may result in a decline in the amount of discretionary consumer spending and otherwise hamper our gross margins. Future economic conditions such as employment levels, business conditions, housing starts, interest rates, inflation rates, energy and fuel costs and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending, leading cost-conscious consumers to be more selective in food products purchased, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, business and financial condition. 
 60 

The failure to successfully integrate newly acquired products or businesses could negatively impact our profitability. 
 From time to time, we may consider opportunities to acquire other products or businesses that may expand the breadth of our markets or customer base. The success of future acquisitions will be dependent upon our ability to effectively integrate the acquired products and operations into our business. Integration can be complex, expensive and time-consuming. The failure to successfully integrate acquired products or businesses in a timely and cost-effective manner could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The diversion of our management s attention and any difficulties encountered in any integration process could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. In addition, the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain the appeal of our brand and our relationships with customers, employees or other third parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and could harm our financial performance. We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired products or businesses. Additionally, an additional risk inherent in any acquisition is that we fail to realize a positive return on our investment. 
 Claims, legal proceedings, and other disputes could divert our management s attention, have a negative impact on our reputation, expose us to significant liabilities, and make it more difficult to obtain insurance coverage. 
 From time to time, we may be party to various claims, legal proceedings, and other disputes. We evaluate these matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. 
 Even when not merited, the defense of legal proceedings may divert our management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these matters. The results of legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these proceedings may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties, or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. Any legal proceedings or other disputes, even if fully indemnified or insured, could have a negative impact on our reputation, and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. 
 Further, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions and caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and amount of our recovery. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Item 2. Unregis tered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 The following issuances of our securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. 
 On March 28, 2024, the Company raised 3,738,078 of capital from the sale of 515,597 newly issued shares of common stock at a share price of 7.25 in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. Investors in the private placement included Sow Good s Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, in addition to certain other Sow Good board members, related parties, and accredited investors. The proceeds were used in funding incremental capital expenditures and general operating expenses. 
 61 

On May 2, 2024, the Company priced its registered underwritten public offering of 1,200,000 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 at a price of 10.00 per share. In addition, the Company granted the underwriters a 30-day overallotment option to purchase up to 180,000 additional shares of common stock and issued to the underwriters warrants to purchase 120,000 shares of Common Stock. On May 1, 2024, the Company received approval to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market stock exchange Nasdaq ). Trading on Nasdaq commenced on May 2, 2024. On May 9, 2024, the underwriters purchased all of the Additional Shares pursuant to the full exercise of their overallotment option. Including proceeds from the Additional Shares, the proceeds from the public offering were approximately 11,974,976 net of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions. The proceeds are currently anticipated to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures for the expansion of our production capacity, funding working and growth capital, the expansion of our sales and marketing function and the reduction of certain tranches of our indebtedness. 
 On April 15, 2024, the Company issued 2,186,250 shares of its common stock in connection with the exercise of warrants that were issued between December 2021 and May 2023 (the Warrants ), with exercise prices varying from 2.21 to 2.60 (the Warrant Exercise ). None of the Warrants were amended prior to or in connection with the Warrant Exercise. Each of the exercising holders of warrants (collectively, the Holders ), received its warrants in connection with the incurrence by the Company of indebtedness pursuant to various tranches of promissory notes issued between December 2021 and May 2023 (collectively, the Notes ). The Warrants were classified as permanent equity at inception. Due to a redemption feature in the Warrants allowing the Company to redeem the Warrants for 0.001 per Warrant if the daily volume weighted average price per share over thirty consecutive trading days is above 9.00, the Company received indications of intent to exercise Warrants from various Holders given the recent increase in trading price of the Company's common stock. With authorization from the Company's Board of Directors, each of the Holders was provided an opportunity to, and agreed to, amend certain of such Holder s Notes (the Notes Amendment to allow for the partial prepayment of principal in an aggregate amount equal to the exercise price of such Holder s Warrants. In addition to the Notes Amendment, certain of the Holders elected use a portion of the accrued but unpaid interest under such Holder s Notes to pay the exercise price of the Warrants. Certain of the Notes were repaid in full as a result of the Warrant Exercise and thereby did not need to be amended pursuant to the Notes Amendment (the Warrant Exercise, whether by partial or full repayment of principal, or by election to use a portion of accrued but unpaid interest under the Notes, together with the Notes Amendment, the Warrant Exercise Transaction ). As a result of the Warrant Exercise Transaction, excluding the impact of deferred debt costs, the Company s debt was reduced by 5,200,362, accrued interest payable was reduced by 98,750, common equity was increased by 5,299,112 and the Company issued an aggregate of 2,186,250 shares of common stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 50,459 shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options by employees, directors, and consultants under its 2020 Stock Option Plan. The aggregate proceeds from the exercise of these options were approximately 163,854. The proceeds are currently anticipated to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures for the expansion of our production capacity, funding working and growth capital, the expansion of our sales and marketing function and the reduction of certain tranches of our indebtedness. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 52,500 shares of common stock upon the exercise of warrants by directors, and consultants under issued in 2020 as compensation for personal guarantees of debt. The aggregate proceeds from the exercise of these warrants were approximately 210,000. The proceeds are currently anticipated to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures for the expansion of our production capacity, funding working and growth capital, the expansion of our sales and marketing function and the reduction of certain tranches of our indebtedness.
