 Current payment performance is used to assess the capability of the borrower to repay contractual obligations of the loan agreements as scheduled, which is monitored by management on a daily basis. The Company s payment performance buckets are as follows: current, 30-60 days past due, 61-90 days past due, 91 days or more past due. 
 
 All loans, except for TALs, that are greater than 90 days past due on a recency basis and not written off as of the reporting date are reserved for at 100 of the outstanding balance, net of a calculated Rehab Rate. The weighted average Rehab Rate at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was and , respectively. A loan is charged off within the allowance for credit losses in the month following when an account reaches 120 days past due on a recency basis, subject to certain exceptions. Specifically, the Company s customer accounts in a confirmed bankruptcy are generally charged off in the month after they reach 60 days past due on a recency basis. The accounts of deceased or incarcerated customers are also generally charged off in the month after they reach 60 days past due on a recency basis, with the exception of deceased customers with credit life insurance. Subsequent recoveries of amounts charged off, if any, are credited to the allowance.

 Credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans to borrowers and is continuously monitored by management and reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the Company s gross loans receivable portfolio. In estimating the allowance for credit losses, loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into pools and collectively assessed. The Company s loan products have generally the same terms therefore the Company looks to borrower characteristics as a way to disaggregate loans into pools sharing similar risks. 
 
 In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company examined four borrower risk metrics as noted below. 
 
 1. Borrower type 
 2. Active months 
 3. Prior loan performance 
 4. Customer Tenure 
 
 To determine how well each metric predicts default risk the Company used loss rate data over an observation period of twelve months at the loan level. 
 
 The information value was then calculated for each metric. From this analysis management determined the metric that had the strongest predictor of default risk was Customer Tenure. The Customer Tenure buckets used in the allowance for credit loss calculation are: 
 
 1. 0 to 5 months 
 2. 6 to 17 months 
 3. 18 to 35 months 
 4. 36 to 59 months 
 5. 60+ months 
 
 Management will continue to monitor this credit metric on a quarterly basis. 
 
 Management estimates an allowance for each Customer Tenure bucket by performing a historical migration analysis of loans in that bucket for the twelve most recent historical twelve-month migration periods. Management considers whether current credit conditions might suggest a change is needed to the allowance for credit losses by monitoring trends in first pay success for new borrowers, 60-89 day delinquencies on a recency basis, percent of loan balances that are paying and percentage of gross loans that are acquired loans. If management determines that historical migration rates should be adjusted to reflect expected credit losses, a qualitative adjustment is made to reflect management's judgment regarding observable changes in recent or expected economic trends and conditions, portfolio composition, or other significant events or conditions that affect the current estimate. The increase in the allowance for credit losses from March 31, 2024 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a seasonally driven increase in expected loss rates. 
 
 Due to the short term nature of the loan portfolio, forecasted changes in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment levels, general inflation and commodity prices, typically do not have a significant impact on loans outstanding at the end of a particular reporting period, unless those changes are particularly severe and sudden in nature. Therefore, management develops a reasonable and supportable forecast of losses by comparing the most recent six-month loss curves as compared to historical loss curves to see if there are significant changes in borrower behavior that may indicate the historical migration rates should be adjusted. If a change is determined necessary, then the Company has elected to immediately revert back to historical experience past the forecast period. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, there were no conditions or other factors considered significant enough to warrant a forecast adjustment.

 The Company elected not to record an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest as outlined in ASC 326-20-30-5A. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the full payment of principal and collection of interest according to contractual terms is no longer likely. The accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is 61 days or more past the contractual due date. When the interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against interest income. While a loan is on nonaccrual status, interest income is recognized only when a payment is received. Once a loan moves to nonaccrual status, it remains in nonaccrual status until it is paid out, charged off or refinanced. ) ) ) 6 to 17 months ) ) ) ) 18 to 35 months ) ) ) ) 36 to 59 months ) ) ) ) 60+ months ) ) ) ) Total ) ) ) )

 at March 31, 2024 was used as the discount rate when determining the lease type and the present value of lease payments for leases entered into in fiscal 2025. 
 
 Based on its historical practice, the Company believes it is reasonably certain to exercise a given option associated with a given office space lease. Therefore, the Company classifies all lease options for office space as reasonably certain unless it has specific knowledge to the contrary for a given lease. The Company does not believe it is reasonably certain to exercise any options associated with its office equipment leases. 
 
 Periodic Disclosures 
 
 The Company's operating leases consist of real estate leases for office space as well as office equipment. Both the branch real estate and office equipment lease terms generally range from to , and generally contain options to extend which mirror the original terms of the lease.

 NOTE 7 
 
 shares of authorized common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to grants approved by the Compensation Committee. Stock options granted under these plans have a maximum term of years, may be subject to certain vesting requirements, which are generally three to for officers, non-employee directors, and key employees, and are priced at the market value of the Company's common stock on the option's grant date. At September 30, 2024, there were a total of shares of common stock remaining available for grant under the 2017 Plan. 
 
 Stock-based compensation is recognized as provided under FASB ASC Topic 718-10 and FASB ASC Topic 505-50. FASB ASC Topic 718-10 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period) in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values. Stock-based compensation related to restricted stock is based on the number of shares expected to vest and the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Stock-based compensation related to stock option awards is based on the number of shares expected to vest and the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Under the Black-Scholes valuation method, the assumptions used to determine the fair value are expected volatility, expected life, average risk-free rate, and dividend yield, if any. The expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for a period approximating the expected life. The expected life represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding after the grant date. The risk-free rate reflects the interest rate at grant date on zero coupon U.S. governmental bonds having a remaining life similar to the expected option term. 
 
 Long-term Incentive Program and Non-Employee Director Awards 
 
 On October 15, 2018, the Compensation Committee and Board approved and adopted a long-term incentive program that seeks to motivate and reward certain employees and to align management s interest with shareholders interest by focusing executives on the achievement of long-term results. The program is comprised of four components: Service Options, Performance Options, Restricted Stock, and Performance Shares. 
 
 Pursuant to this program, in fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee approved certain grants of Service Options, Performance Options, Restricted Stock and Performance Shares under the 2011 Plan and the 2017 Plan to certain employee directors, vice presidents of operations, vice presidents, senior vice presidents, and executive officers. Separately, the Compensation Committee approved certain grants of Service Options and Restricted Stock to certain non-employee directors of the Company. 
 
 Under the long-term incentive program, up to of the shares of restricted stock subject to the Performance Shares will vest, if at all, based on the achievement of two trailing EPS performance targets established by the Compensation Committee that are based on EPS (measured at the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter ending September 30, 2019) for the previous four calendar quarters. The Performance Shares are eligible to vest over the Performance Share Measurement Period, subject to each respective employee s continued employment at the Company through the last day of the Performance Share Measurement Period (or as otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement). 

During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, it was determined that the Performance Share performance target was no longer probable of being achieved and that the Performance Shares would likely be forfeited as of the last day of the performance period in accordance with their terms. As a result and in accordance with ASC 718, the Company reversed million in previously recognized stock-based compensation related to the Performance Shares during the second quarter of fiscal 2025.

 to equal annual installments, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to each respective employee s continued employment at the Company through each applicable vesting date or otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement. 
 
 The Service Options typically vest in three equal annual installments, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to each respective employee s continued employment at the Company through each applicable vesting date or otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement. The option price is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date and the Service Options have a -year term. 
 
 The Performance Options will fully vest if the Company attains the trailing EPS target over four consecutive calendar quarters occurring between September 30, 2018 and March 31, 2025 as described below. Such performance target was established by the Compensation Committee and will be measured at the end of each calendar quarter commencing on September 30, 2019. The Performance Options are eligible to vest over the Option Measurement Period, subject to each respective employee s continued employment at the Company through the last day of the Option Measurement Period or as otherwise provided under the terms of the applicable award agreement or applicable employment agreement. The option price is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date and the Performance Options have a -year term. 

During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, it was determined that the Performance Option performance target was no longer probable of being achieved and that the Performance Options would likely be forfeited as of the last day of the performance period in accordance with their terms.

 The Company s effective income tax rate decreased to 20.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.1 for the corresponding period of the previous year. The decrease is primarily due to the effects of pretax book earnings relative to the effects of various permanent items including a decrease in the disallowed executive compensation under Section 162(m) and the recognition of additional HTCs when compared to the prior year. 
 
 Comparison of six months ended September 30, 2024 versus six months ended September 30, 2023

 Revenues decreased by 15.3 million, or 5.5 , to 260.9 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 from 276.2 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average net loans outstanding. 
 
 Interest and fee income for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 8.5 million, or 3.6 , from the same period of the prior year. Net loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 decreased by 5.2 over the balance at September 30, 2023. Average net loans outstanding decreased by 6.8 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six-month period ended September 30, 2023.

Benefit expense decreased approximately 2.0 million, or 11.7 , when comparing the six month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Incentive expense decreased 18.1 million, mostly due to the 18.5 million reversal of the expense associated with the 20.45 Performance Shares since the Company is no longer expected to achieve the target required to vest. 
 
 Occupancy and equipment expense totaled 24.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.5 million, or 2.2 , decrease over the six months ended September 30, 2023. Occupancy and equipment expense is generally a function of the number of branches the Company has open throughout the period. For the six months ended September 30, 2024, the average occupancy and equipment expense per branch totaled 23.4 thousand, a 0.3 thousand, or 1.3 decrease when compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Advertising expense totaled 4.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.5 million, or 10.3 , decrease over the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased spending on customer acquisition programs.

Regulatory Matters 
 
 CFPB Rulemaking Initiatives 
 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 On October 5, 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule (the "Rule") imposing limitations on (i) short-term consumer loans, (ii) longer-term consumer installment loans with balloon payments, and (iii) higher-rate consumer installment loans repayable by a payment authorization. The Rule originally required lenders originating short-term loans and longer-term balloon payment loans to evaluate whether each consumer has the ability to repay the loan along with current obligations and expenses ability to repay requirements however, the ability to repay requirements was rescinded in July 2020. The Rule also curtails repeated unsuccessful attempts to debit consumers accounts for short-term loans, balloon payment loans, and installment loans that involve a payment authorization and an annual percentage rate over 36 payment requirements ). Implementation of the Rule s payment requirements may require changes to the Company s practices and procedures for such loans, which could materially and adversely affect the Company s ability to make such loans, the cost of making such loans, the Company s ability to, or frequency with which it could, refinance any such loans, and the profitability of such loans. 
 
 In July 2020, the CFPB rescinded provisions of the Rule governing the ability to repay requirements. The payment requirements were scheduled to take effect in June 2022. However, on October 19, 2022, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled, in Community Financial Services Association of America v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that the funding mechanism for the CFPB violates the appropriations clause of the U.S. Constitution, and as a result, vacated the Rule. On October 3, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court held oral argument to decide the constitutionality of the CFPB's funding mechanism. On May 16, 2024, the Supreme Court held that the funding mechanism for the CFPB complies with the appropriations clause of the U.S. Constitution, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanding the cause for further proceedings. To the extent that the Rule is reinstated and takes effect, any regulatory changes could have effects beyond those currently contemplated that could further materially and adversely impact our business and operations. Unless rescinded or otherwise amended, the Company will have to comply with the Rule s payment requirements if it continues to allow consumers to set up future recurring payments online for certain covered loans such that it meets the definition of having a leveraged payment mechanism under the Rule. If the payment provisions of the Rule apply, the Company will have to modify its loan payment procedures to comply with the required notices and mandated timeframes set forth in the final rule. 
 
 The CFPB also has stated that it expects to conduct separate rulemaking to identify larger participants in the installment lending market for purposes of its supervision program. This initiative was classified as inactive on the CFPB s Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda and has remained inactive since, but the CFPB indicated that such action was not a decision on the merits. Though the likelihood and timing of any such rulemaking is uncertain, the Company believes that the implementation of such rules would likely bring the Company s business under the CFPB s supervisory authority which, among other things, would subject the Company to reporting obligations to, and on-site compliance examinations by, the CFPB. In addition, even in the absence of a larger participant rule, the CFPB has the power to order individual nonbank financial institutions to submit to supervision where the CFPB has reasonable cause to determine that the institution is engaged in conduct that poses risks to consumers under 12 USC 5514(a)(1)(C). In 2022, the CFPB announced that it had begun using this dormant authority to examine nonbank entities and the CFPB is attempting to expand the number of nonbank entities it currently supervises. Specifically, the CFPB previously notified the Company that it was seeking to establish such supervisory authority over the Company. Since then, the CFPB issued a public designation order setting forth its determination that the Company has met the legal requirements for supervision (the "Order"). Pursuant to the terms of the Order, the CFPB has supervisory authority over the Company pursuant to section 1024(a)(1)(C) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 until such time as the Order is terminated consistent with 12 C.F.R. 1091.113. Importantly, while the Order establishes that the CFPB has supervisory authority over the Company, it does not constitute a finding that the Company has engaged in wrongdoing, nor does it require any immediate action on the part of the Company. However, the outcome of such supervision could result in operational changes which could reduce our ability to operate profitably or increase compliance costs. The supervision could also result in additional examinations, investigations, litigation, consent orders or administrative proceedings, which could require considerable resources, time, effort and attention from our management, and may result in operational changes, monetary penalties or declines in our stock price. 
 
 See Part I, Item 1, Business Government Regulation Federal legislation, for a further discussion of these matters and the federal regulations to which the Company s operations are subject and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in each case, in the Company s fiscal 2024 Annual Report for more information regarding these regulatory and related risks.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company has historically financed and continues to finance its operations, acquisitions and branch expansion primarily through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings from its institutional lenders. As discussed below, the Company has also issued debt securities to finance its operations and repay a portion of its outstanding indebtedness. The Company has generally applied its cash flows from operations to fund its loan volume, fund acquisitions, repay long-term indebtedness, and repurchase its common stock. Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 102.1 million. 
 
 The Company believes that attractive opportunities to acquire new branches or receivables from its competitors or to acquire branches in communities not currently served by the Company will continue to become available as conditions in local economies and the financial circumstances of owners change. 
 
 On September 27, 2021, we issued 300 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.0 senior notes due November 2026. The Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Company s existing and certain of its future subsidiaries that guarantee the revolving credit facility. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2022. At any time prior to November 1, 2023, the Company could have redeemed the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium, as described in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. At any time on or after November 1, 2023, the Company may redeem the Notes at redemption prices set forth in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time prior to November 1, 2023, the Company could have used the proceeds of certain equity offerings to redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the indenture at a redemption price equal to 107.0 of the principal amount of Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. 
 
 We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and extinguished 33.7 million of its Notes, net of 
 0.3 million unamortized debt issuance costs related to the extinguished debt, on the open market for a reacquisition price of 32.5 million. 
 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company repurchased and extinguished 15.7 million of its Notes, net of 0.2 million unamortized debt issuance costs related to the extinguished debt, on the open market for a reacquisition price of 14.1 million. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a 0.4 million and 0.2 million gain on extinguishment, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a 1.2 million and 0.6 million gain on extinguishment, respectively. In accordance with ASC 470, the Company recognized the gain on extinguishment as a component of interest expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 The indenture governing the Notes contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends or distributions or redeem or purchase capital stock; (iii) prepay subordinated debt or make certain investments; (iv) transfer and sell assets; (v) create or permit to exist liens; (vi) enter into agreements that restrict dividends, loans and other distributions from their subsidiaries; (vii) engage in a merger, consolidation or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; and (viii) engage in transactions with affiliates. However, these covenants are subject to a number of important detailed qualifications and exceptions. 
 
 The Company continues to believe stock repurchases are a viable component of the Company s long-term financial strategy and an excellent use of excess cash when the opportunity arises. However, our revolving credit facility and the Notes limit share repurchases to up to 50 of consolidated adjusted net income for the period commencing January 1, 2019. As of September 30, 2024, subject to further approval from our Board of Directors, we could repurchase approximately 24.7 million of shares under the terms of our debt facilities. Additional share repurchases can be made subject to compliance with, among other things, applicable restricted payment covenants under the revolving credit facility and the Notes. 
 
 The Company has a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The revolving credit facility provides for revolving borrowings of up to the lesser of (a) the aggregate commitments under the facility and (b) a borrowing base, and it includes 725.8 thousand in outstanding standby letters of credit. 
 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 Subject to a borrowing base formula, the Company may borrow at the rate of one month SOFR plus 0.10 and an applicable margin of 3.5 with a minimum rate of 4.5 . At September 30, 2024, the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility were 580.0 million. The Company had 725.8 thousand in outstanding standby letters of credit which include (i) 300.0 thousand related to worker's compensation expiring on December 31, 2024 and (ii) 425.8 thousand related to the Company's investment in captive insurance expiring on April 12, 2025. Both letters of credit automatically extend for one year on their expiration dates. The borrowing base limitation is equal to the product of (a) the Company s eligible finance receivables, less unearned finance charges, insurance premiums and insurance commissions applicable to such eligible finance receivables, and (b) an advance rate percentage that ranges from 70 to 80 based on a collateral performance indicator, as more completely described below. Further, under the amended and restated revolving credit agreement, the administrative agent has the right to set aside reasonable reserves against the available borrowing base in such amounts as it may deem appropriate, including, without limitation, reserves with respect to certain regulatory events or any increased operational, legal, or regulatory risk of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the Company s effective interest rate, including the commitment fee and amortization of debt issuance costs, as it relates to the revolving credit facility was 10.1 annualized and 9.9 , respectively. At September 30, 2024, the unused amount available under the revolving credit facility was 313.6 million. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility mature on June 7, 2026. 
 
 The Company s obligations under the revolving credit facility, together with treasury management and hedging obligations owing to any lender under the revolving credit facility or any affiliate of any such lender, are required to be guaranteed by each of the Company s wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The obligations of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors under the revolving credit facility, together with such treasury management and hedging obligations, are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. 
 
 The agreement governing the Company s revolving credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur or guarantee indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends and repurchase or redeem capital stock, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments, redeem or prepay subordinated debt, amend subordinated debt documents, make changes in the nature of its business, and engage in transactions with affiliates. The agreement allows the Company to incur subordinated debt that matures after the termination date for the revolving credit facility and that contains specified subordination terms, subject to limitations on amount imposed by the financial covenants under the agreement. The agreement's financial covenants include (i) a minimum consolidated net worth of 325 million on and after December 31, 2020; (ii) a maximum ratio of total debt to consolidated adjusted net worth of 2.25 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 and each fiscal quarter thereafter; (iii) a maximum collateral performance indicator of 26.0 as of the end of each calendar month; and (iv) a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio of 2.0 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2023 through December 31, 2024, and 2.25 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter, where the ratio for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters (other than for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023) must be at least 2.0 to 1.0, in order for the Company to declare dividends or purchase any class or series of its capital stock or other equity. 
 
 The collateral performance indicator is equal to the sum of (a) a three-month rolling average rate of receivables at least sixty days past due and (b) an eight-month rolling average net charge-off rate. 
 
 The Company was in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024 and does not believe that these covenants will materially limit its business and expansion strategy. 
 
 The agreement contains events of default including, without limitation, nonpayment of principal, interest or other obligations, violation of covenants, misrepresentation, cross-default to other debt, bankruptcy and other insolvency events, judgments, certain ERISA events, actual or asserted invalidity of loan documentation, invalidity of subordination provisions of subordinated debt, certain changes of control of the Company, and the occurrence of certain regulatory events, (including the entry of any stay, order, judgment, ruling or similar event related to the Company s or any of its subsidiaries originating, holding, pledging, collecting or enforcing its eligible loans receivable that is material to the Company or any subsidiary) which remains unvacated, undischarged, unbonded or unstayed by appeal or otherwise for a period of 60 days from the date of its entry and is reasonably likely to cause a material adverse change. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's debt outstanding was 504.9 million, net of 1.7 million unamortized debt issuance costs related to the unsecured senior notes payable, and its shareholders' equity was 417.5 million resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2:1.0. Management will continue to monitor the Company's debt-to-equity ratio and is committed to maintaining a debt level that will allow the Company to continue to execute its business objectives, while not putting undue stress on its consolidated balance sheet.

 The Company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility or other sources will be adequate to fund the expected cost of opening or acquiring new branches, including funding initial operating losses of new branches and funding loans receivable originated by those branches and the Company's other branches (for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future beyond that). Except as otherwise discussed in (i) this report including, but not limited to, any discussions in Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (ii) Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in the Company's fiscal 2024 Annual Report (as supplemented by any subsequent disclosures in information the Company files with or furnishes to the SEC from time to time), management is not currently aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that it believes will or could result in, or are or could be reasonably likely to result in, any material adverse effect on the Company s liquidity. 

Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On May 15, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 20.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock, inclusive of the amount that remained available for repurchase under prior repurchase authorizations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 10.0 million in aggregate remaining repurchase capacity under its current share repurchase program. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, available funds, alternative uses of capital, restrictions under the revolving credit agreement, and other market and economic conditions. The Company s stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 
 The Company continues to believe stock repurchases are a viable component of the Company s long-term financial strategy and an excellent use of excess cash when the opportunity arises. Additional share repurchases can be made subject to compliance with, among other things, applicable restricted payment covenants under the revolving credit facility and the Notes. Our first priority is to ensure we have enough capital to fund loan growth. As of September 30, 2024, subject to further approval from our Board of Directors, we could repurchase approximately 24.7 million of shares under the terms of our debt facilities. To the extent we have excess capital, we may repurchase stock, if appropriate and as authorized by our Board of Directors. 

Inflation 
 
 The Company does not believe that inflation will have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition, unless changes in inflation are particularly severe and sudden in nature. Although inflation would increase the Company s operating costs in absolute terms, the Company expects that the same decrease in the value of money would result in an increase in the size of loans demanded by its customer base. It is reasonable to anticipate that such a change in customer preference would result in an increase in total loans receivable and an increase in absolute revenue to be generated from that larger amount of loans receivable. The Company believes that this increase in absolute revenue should offset any increase in operating costs. In addition, because the Company s loans have a relatively short contractual term and average life, it is unlikely that loans made at any given point in time will be repaid with significantly inflated dollars.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 There were no new accounting pronouncements recently adopted. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The Company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the finance company industry. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgment by the Company s management, including the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. As a result, changes in these estimates and assumptions could significantly affect the Company s financial position and results of operations. The Company considers its policies regarding the allowance for credit losses, share-based compensation and income taxes to be its most critical accounting policies due to the significant degree of management judgment involved. 
 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgement and estimation by management. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance account represents management s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions, qualitative factors, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 
 The Company measures compensation cost for share-based awards at fair value and recognizes compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company s common stock at the time of grant, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of assumptions, including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected life. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable, deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns, and income tax expense. Determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets. These judgments and estimates are re-evaluated on a periodic basis as regulatory and business factors change. 
 
 No assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by management or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings, changes in the tax code, or assessments made by the IRS, state, or foreign taxing authorities. The Company is subject to potential adverse adjustments, including but not limited to: an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates, the permanent non-deductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods, and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets. 
 
 Under FASB ASC Topic 740, the Company will include the current and deferred tax impact of its tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (likelihood of greater than 50 that such positions will be sustained by taxing authorities, with full knowledge of relevant information, based on the technical merits of the tax position. While the Company supports its tax positions by unambiguous tax law, prior experience with the taxing authority, and analysis of what it considers to be all relevant facts, circumstances and regulations, management must still rely on assumptions and estimates to determine the overall likelihood of success and proper quantification of a given tax position.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company s outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility was 265.6 million at September 30, 2024. Interest on borrowings under this facility is based on the greater of 4.5 or one month SOFR plus 0.10 and an applicable margin of 3.5 . Based on the outstanding balance under the Company's revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024, a change of 1.0 in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately 2.7 million on an annual basis. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Based on management s evaluation, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our management, including the CEO and CFO do not expect that our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
