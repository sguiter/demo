million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the year
ended December 31, 2023 and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. These and prior year
losses have resulted in significant negative cash flows and have required the Company to raise substantial amounts of additional capital.
To date, the Company has primarily financed its operations through multiple offerings of its equity and equity-linked securities and
the issuance of convertible notes and loans to investors and affiliates. As disclosed in Note 8, in February 2024, the Company completed
a public offering of its common stock and common stock purchase warrants for net proceeds of million.

shares of the Company s
pre-reverse split outstanding common stock and exchangeable shares were combined and reclassified into one share of common stock. Proportionate
voting rights and other rights of holders of common stock and exchangeable shares were not affected by the reverse stock split. Any fractional
shares of common stock and exchangeable shares resulting from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All
stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and common stock reserved for issuance under the Company s equity incentive
plans and warrants outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split were adjusted by dividing the number of affected shares of
common stock by 40 and, as applicable, multiplying the exercise price by 40, as a result of the reverse stock split. All share and per-share
amounts in these condensed consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split as if it had occurred
at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

expense was approximately million for each of the three-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Rent expense was approximately

the Company is responsible for property taxes, insurance and certain other operating costs related to the leased facilities and equipment. 

Indemnification 

In
the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which it may agree to indemnify the counterparties
from any losses incurred relating to breach of representations and warranties, failure to perform certain covenants, or claims and losses
arising from certain events as outlined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, losses arising from litigation
or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The Company has also
entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors. No material amounts were reflected in the Company s condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to these indemnifications. 

The
Company has not estimated the maximum potential amount of indemnification liability under these agreements due to the limited history
of prior claims and the unique facts and circumstances applicable to each particular agreement. To date, the Company has not made any
payments related to these indemnification agreements. 

Product
Warranties 

The
Company warrants certain of its products to be free of defects generally for a period of three years. The Company estimates its warranty
costs based on historical warranty claim experience and includes such costs in cost of net revenues. Warranty costs were not material
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Legal
Matters 

The
Company is not a party to any legal proceeding that the Company believes is likely to have a material adverse effect on its condensed
consolidated financial position or results of operations. From time to time the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims
in the ordinary course of business. These claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources
and diversion of management efforts. 

Purchase
Obligations 

The
Company s primary purchase obligations include non-cancelable purchase orders for inventory. At September 30, 2024, the Company
had outstanding non-cancelable purchase orders for inventory, primarily wafers and substrates, and related expenditures of approximately

shares were initially reserved for issuance. In November 2021, in connection with the approval of the Arrangement, the
Company s stockholders approved an amendment increasing the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan by 
shares. 

Under
the 2019 Plan, the term of all incentive stock options granted to a person who, at the time of grant, owns stock representing more than
 of the voting power of all classes of the Company s stock may not exceed . The exercise price of stock options granted
under the 2019 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Generally, awards under the 2019
Plan will vest over a to four-year period, and options will have a term of from the date of grant. In addition, the 2019
Plan provides for automatic acceleration of vesting for options granted to non-employee directors upon a change of control of the Company. 

In
connection with the Arrangement, the Company assumed the Peraso Technologies Inc. 2009 Share Option Plan (the 2009 Plan) and all outstanding
options granted pursuant to the terms of the 2009 Plan. Each outstanding, unexercised and unexpired option under the 2009 Plan, whether
vested or unvested, was assumed by the Company and converted into options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock. No
further awards will be made under the 2009 Plan. 

The
2009 Plan, the Amended 2010 Plan and the 2019 Plan are referred to collectively as the Plans.

Exchangeable Shares and shares of common stock (collectively, the Escrow Shares). The Escrow Shares are escrowed pursuant
to the terms of an escrow agreement on a pro rata basis from the aggregate consideration received by the holders of Peraso Shares, subject
to the offset by the Company for any losses in accordance with the Agreement. Such Escrow Shares shall be released, subject to any offset
claim, upon the satisfaction of the earlier of: (a) any date following the first anniversary of December 17, 2021 and prior to December
17, 2024 where the volume weighted average price of the common stock for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading
days is at least per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits or other similar transactions; (b) the date of any sale of
all or substantially all of the assets or shares of the Company; or (c) the date of any bankruptcy, insolvency, restructuring, receivership,
administration, wind-up, liquidation, dissolution, or similar event involving the Company. All and any voting rights and other stockholder
rights, other than with respect to dividends and distributions, with respect to the Escrow Shares are suspended until the Escrow Shares
are released from escrow. 

The
Exchangeable Share structure is commonly used for cross-border transactions of this nature so as to provide non-tax-exempt Canadian shareholders
with the same economic rights and benefits as holders of the Company s shares into which the Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable,
while allowing those Canadian shareholders to benefit from the tax-rollover available on the issuance of the Exchangeable Shares. In
general terms, by choosing to acquire Exchangeable Shares from Canco, such a former Peraso Tech shareholder was able to rely on a rollover
rule in the Income Tax Act (Canada) in order to defer any capital gain that he/she/it would have otherwise realized. 

Callco
was incorporated to exercise the call rights, while Canco was incorporated to acquire the shares of Peraso Tech from Canadian shareholders
that wished to receive Exchangeable Shares as consideration, so it was a tax deferred transaction for such Canadian shareholders. The
use of a separate entity, Callco, helps maximize cross border paid-up capital, which represents the amount that can generally be distributed
free of Canadian withholding tax. The call rights also allow Callco to purchase the Exchangeable Shares rather than having
them redeemed by Canco on a redemption or retraction or in connection with a liquidity event, thus avoiding the adverse deemed dividend
tax consequences to shareholders that may arise from a redemption or retraction of Exchangeable Shares. 

Holders
of Exchangeable Shares have the right at any time (the Retraction Right) to retract or redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares owned
by them for an amount per share equal to the market price of a share of the Company s common stock plus the full amount of all
declared and unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Share (the Exchangeable Share Purchase Price). The Exchangeable Share Purchase Price
is payable only by the Company delivering or causing to be delivered to the relevant holder one share of the Company s common stock
for each Exchangeable Share purchased plus a cash amount equal to the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable
Share. The Company and Callco each have an overriding right, in the event that a holder of Exchangeable Shares exercises its Retraction
Right, to redeem from such holder all, but not less than all, of the Exchangeable Shares tendered for redemption.

of the aggregate number of Exchangeable Shares issued remain outstanding; (b) there is a change in control of the Company
(defined generally as (i) any merger, amalgamation, arrangement, takeover bid or tender offer, material sale of shares or rights or interests
that results in the holders of outstanding voting securities of the Company directly or indirectly owning, or exercising control or direction
over, voting securities representing less than of the total voting power of all of the voting securities of the surviving entity;
or (ii) any sale or disposition of all or substantially of the Company s assets), and (c) upon the occurrence of certain other
events. The Exchangeable Share Purchase Price is payable only by the Company delivering or causing to be delivered to the relevant holder
one share of the Company s common stock for each Exchangeable Share purchased plus a cash amount equal to the amount of any accrued
and unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Share. 

In
the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Canco, holders of Exchangeable Shares have the right to receive in respect
of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder, an amount per share equal to the Exchangeable Share Purchase Price, which shall be satisfied
in full by Canco by delivering to such holder one Company Share, plus an amount equal to the Dividend Amount. The Company and Callco
each have an overriding right to purchase from all holders all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares upon the occurrence of
such events. 

In
addition, the Company and Callco have the right to purchase all outstanding Exchangeable Shares at the Exchangeable Share Purchase Price
if there is a change of law that permits holders of Exchangeable Shares to exchange their Exchangeable Shares for shares of common stock
on a basis that will not require holders to recognize any gain or loss or any actual or deemed dividend for Canadian tax purposes. 

The
holders of Exchangeable Shares have an automatic exchange right in the event of any insolvency, liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up or in general, related proceedings, of the Company for an amount per share equal to the Exchangeable Share Purchase Price. 

It
is expected that Callco will exercise its call rights, as that is more beneficial to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Once Callco
acquires the Exchangeable Shares from a holder, it (Callco and the Company) is obligated to deliver the Company shares to the holder.
Callco discharges this obligation by arranging for the Company to issue and deliver those shares to the holders on behalf of Callco.
As consideration for satisfying the delivery obligation, Callco would issue its own shares to the Company. 

There
are no cash redemption features, as all redemption and exchange scenarios are payable in a share of the Company s common stock.
Neither Canco, Callco, or the Company assume any tax liabilities of a former Peraso Tech shareholder who acquired Exchangeable Shares
under the plan of arrangement. The purchase price computed upon the exercise of rights pertaining to retraction, redemption, or liquidation,
or otherwise giving rise to a purchase or cancellation of an Exchangeable Share, will, in all cases, consist of a 1:1 exchange involving
the Company s common stock, regardless of the market price of a share of the Company s common stock. 

In
connection with the Arrangement, on December 15, 2021, the Company filed the Certificate of Designation of Series A Special Voting Preferred
Stock (the Certificate) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to designate Series A Special Voting Preferred Stock (the
Special Voting Share) in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement in order to enable the holders of Exchangeable Shares
to exercise their voting rights. The Special Voting Share was issued to a third-party administrative agent (the Agent) solely to facilitate
the exercise of rights by holders of Exchangeable Shares. The rights of the Agent, as holder of the Special Voting Share, are limited
to effecting the rights of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares; the Special Voting Share does not confer any independent rights to
the Agent. Under the Certificate, when all of the Exchangeable Shares have been converted into shares of the Company s common stock,
the Special Voting Share shall be automatically cancelled and shall not be reissued. Each Exchangeable Share is exchangeable for one
share of common stock of the Company and while outstanding, the Special Voting Share enables holders of Exchangeable Shares to cast votes
on matters for which holders of the common stock are entitled to vote, and by virtue of the share terms relating to the Exchangeable
Shares, enable the Exchangeable Shares to receive dividends that are economically equivalent to any dividends declared with respect to
the shares of common stock. As the Special Voting Share does not participate in dividends (only the Exchangeable Shares participate in
dividends) and is not entitled to participate in the residual interest of the Company, it is not classified as an equity instrument in
the Company s financial statements.

shares of common stock, Series A warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 
shares of common stock that may be purchased pursuant to a 45-day option to purchase additional securities granted to Ladenburg by the
Company. Ladenburg partially exercised this option on February 7, 2024 for shares of common stock, Series A warrants to purchase
up to shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock. The combined public offering
price of each share of common stock, together with the accompanying Series A warrants and Series B warrants, was , less underwriting
discounts and commissions. The combined public offering price of each pre-funded warrant, together with the accompanying Series A warrants
and Series B warrants, was , less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Offering, including the additional shares of common
stock, Series A warrants and Series B warrants sold pursuant to the partial exercise of Ladenburg s option, closed on February
8, 2024. 

The
net proceeds from the Offering, including the additional shares of common stock, Series A warrants and Series B warrants sold pursuant
to the partial exercise of Ladenburg s option, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated Offering
expenses payable by the Company and excluding any proceeds from the exercise of the Series A warrants, Series B warrants and pre-funded
warrants, were approximately million. 

The
Series A warrants and Series B warrants each have an exercise price of per share and were immediately exercisable upon issuance.
The Series A warrants expire on February 8, 2029, and the Series B warrants had an initial expiration date of August 8, 2024. On
August 6, 2024, the Company extended the expiration date of its outstanding Series B warrants to October 7, 2024, by entering into an
amendment to the Warrant Agency Agreement dated as of February 8, 2024 by and between the Company and the warrant agent, Equiniti Trust
Company, LLC (the Warrant Agency Agreement). 

The
pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of per share, were exercisable immediately and may be exercised at any time until all
of the pre-funded warrants are exercised in full. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the
warrants is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations or similar events affecting
the common stock and the exercise price. Subject to limited exceptions, a holder may not exercise any portion of its warrants to the
extent that the holder would beneficially own more than or (at the election of the holder) of the Company s outstanding
common stock after exercise. 

On
February 8, 2024, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company issued Series A warrants to Ladenburg to purchase up to 
shares of common stock at an exercise price of , subject to adjustments, which are exercisable at any time and from time to time,
in whole or in part, until February 8, 2029.

ITEM
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report. This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, which include, without limitation, statements about the market for our technology, our strategy, competition, expected
financial performance and capital raising effort, the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, and inflation, which could cause customers

Overview 

We
were formerly known as MoSys, Inc. MoSys ), and we were
incorporated in California in 1991 and reincorporated in 2000 in Delaware. On September 14, 2021,
we and our subsidiaries, 2864552 Ontario Inc. and 2864555 Ontario Inc., entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the Arrangement
Agreement with Peraso Technologies Inc. Peraso Tech ), a corporation existing under the laws of the province of
Ontario, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Peraso Tech (the Peraso Shares ), including those
Peraso Shares to be issued in connection with the conversion or exchange of secured convertible debentures and common share purchase
warrants of Peraso Tech, as applicable, by way of a statutory plan of arrangement (the Arrangement under the Business
Corporations Act (Ontario). On December 17, 2021, following the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Arrangement
Agreement, the Arrangement was completed and we changed our name to Peraso Inc. 
and began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market (the Nasdaq under the symbol PRSO. 

Our
strategy and primary business objective is to be a profitable, IP-rich fabless semiconductor company offering integrated circuits, or
ICs, antenna modules and related non-recurring engineering services. We specialize in the development of mmWave semiconductors, primarily
in the unlicensed 60 GHz spectrum band for 802.11ad/ay- compliant devices and in the 28/39 GHz spectrum bands for 5G-compliant devices.
We derive our revenue from selling semiconductor devices, as well as antenna modules based on using those mmWave semiconductor devices.
 We have pioneered a high-volume mmWave IC production test methodology
using standard, low-cost production test equipment. It has taken us several years to refine performance of this production test methodology,
and we believe this places us in a leadership position in addressing operational challenges of delivering mmWave products into high-volume
markets. We also produce and sell complete mmWave antenna modules. The primary advantage provided by our antenna modules is that our
proprietary mmWave ICs and the antenna are integrated into a single device. A differentiating characteristic of mmWave technology is
that the RF amplifiers must be as close as possible to the antenna to minimize loss. With our module, we can guarantee the performance
of the amplifier/antenna interface and simplify customers radio frequency RF engineering, facilitating more opportunities
for customer prospects that have not provided RF-type systems, as well as shortening the time to market for new products. 

We
also acquired a memory product line comprising our Bandwidth Engine IC products. These products integrate our proprietary, 1T-SRAM high-density
embedded memory and a highly-efficient serial interface protocol resulting in a monolithic memory IC solution optimized for memory bandwidth
and transaction access performance. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, is the sole foundry that manufactures the
wafers used to produce our memory IC products. TSMC has informed us that it would be discontinuing the foundry process used to produce
wafers, in turn, necessary to manufacture our memory ICs. As a result, in May 2023, we initiated an end-of-life, or EOL, of our memory
IC products, and we commenced initial EOL shipments during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. We have requested customers to pay a
deposit upon purchase order placement to reserve supply and provide funding for our required inventory purchases. In
addition, we have requested customers to accelerate payments to improve our cash flows. Under our EOL plan, we expect to complete shipments
of our memory products by March 31, 2025. However, the timing of EOL shipments will be dependent on the potential receipt of additional
purchase orders from customers, deliveries from our suppliers, and the delivery schedules requested by our customers. 

25 

We
incurred net losses of approximately 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 16.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, and we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 175.6 million as of September 30, 2024. These and prior
year losses have resulted in significant negative cash flows and historically have required us to raise substantial amounts of additional
capital. As discussed below, this raises significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to increase
revenues substantially beyond levels that we have attained in the past in order to generate sustainable operating profit and sufficient
cash flows to continue doing business without raising additional capital from time to time. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
December 15, 2023, at our annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved a certificate of amendment to our Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Charter Amendment to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares
of common stock at a ratio to be determined by our board of directors. On December 15, 2023, we filed the Charter Amendment with the
Secretary of State of Delaware which effected a 1-for-40 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock as of 4:01 p.m.
Eastern Time on January 2, 2024. As a result of the reverse stock split, every forty shares of common stock were combined into one issued
and outstanding share of common stock, with no change in the 0.001 par value per share. Holders of fractional shares received, in lieu
of any fractional share, the number of shares rounded up to the next whole number. All equity awards outstanding and common stock reserved
for issuance under our equity incentive plans and warrants outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split were appropriately
adjusted by dividing the number of affected shares of common stock by 40 and, as applicable, multiplying the exercise price by 40, as
a result of the reverse stock split. Exchangeable shares, which can be converted to common stock at any time by their respective holders,
were also adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

We
are subject to risks from, among other things, competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated with financing,
liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history, pandemics, wars and acts of terrorism and
the volatility of public markets. We may be unable to access the capital markets, and additional capital may only be available to us
on terms that could be significantly detrimental to our existing stockholders and to our business. 

For
additional information on risks that could impact our future results of operations, please refer to Risk Factors in Part
II, Item 1A. of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of
these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis we make these estimates based on our historical experience and on
assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and reported results
could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are disclosed in Note 1 of
the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies and estimates.

Product
revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023 primarily due to the
decrease in shipments of our mmWave ICs and antenna modules, which was partially offset by increases in shipments of our memory IC products.
The increase in memory IC product shipments during 2024 was attributable to the increase in EOL shipments. We initiated price increases
on certain of our antenna module products in 2022, however, through September 30, 2024, we had not realized any material increase in
revenue as a result of those price increases. 

Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) is the sole foundry that manufactures the wafers used to produce our memory IC products.
TSMC informed us that TSMC is discontinuing the foundry process used to produce wafers, in turn, necessary to manufacture our memory
ICs. As a result, in May 2023, we informed our customers that we would be initiating an end-of-life (EOL) of our memory IC products.
As of September 30, 2024, we had non-cancelable purchase order backlog from customers for our memory IC products of 5.7 million. We
expect to fulfill this backlog and complete final shipments of our memory IC products by March 31, 2025. 

We
expect revenues to increase in 2024 as compared with 2023, as we anticipate increased sales of our memory IC products based on our EOL
purchase order backlog. In addition, we expect sales of our mmWave products to increase from a volume and revenue perspective over the
next 12 months, as we expect to commence production shipments to new customers beginning in early 2025.

three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in royalty revenues
from licensees of our memory technology due to reduced shipments by these licensees, which we attribute to the EOL initiated by TSMC,
as partially offset by increases in non-recurring engineering services revenue related to our mmWave technology.

Cost
of net revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to a
decrease in sales of our mmWave IC and module products, which was partially offset by an increase in shipments of our memory IC products
in 2024 and 0.2 million of inventory write downs of our mmWave product inventory. Cost of net revenue decreased for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 when compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to the decrease in sales of our mmWave IC and module
products, which was partially offset by an increase in shipments of our memory IC products in 2024, 0.3 million of inventory write downs
of our mmWave product inventory and increased amortization of developed technology of approximately 0.3 million, as we reduced the useful
life of the assets in May 2023 as a result of the EOL of our memory products.

Gross
profit decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in sales
of our mmWave IC and module products and royalty and other revenues, partially offset by an increase in shipment volumes of our memory
IC products to fulfill EOL purchase orders. Gross profit increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same
period of 2023 due to the increase in shipments of our memory IC products, as these products carry higher gross margins, and this increase
was partially offset by a decrease in shipments of our mmWave products. The increase in our gross profit margin percentage for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the prior year period was primarily attributable to the increase in shipments of our memory
IC products, which carry higher gross margins than our mmWave products. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded
revenue of 81,000 from inventory that had been written down in prior periods.

Our
research and development, or R D, expenses include costs related to the development of our products. We expense R D costs as
they are incurred. 

The
decrease for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023 was primarily due to reduced salary
and consulting costs, as we implemented reductions in force in February and November 2023 and terminated consultant contracts, as well
as a decrease in rent expense for the Toronto office lease, as we reduced the space we rent effective January 2024, and reduced software
license expense. As disclosed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, in June 2024, we recorded a charge of approximately
 1.6 million for non-cancelable license commitments for computer-aided design software. 

We
expect that total R D expenses will decrease during 2024 compared with 2023, as a result of our cost reduction initiatives initiated
during 2023 .

Selling,
general and administrative, or SG A, expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales, marketing, finance,
human resources and general management and amortization of certain intangible assets. 

The
increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023 was primarily attributable to
increased consulting and professional services costs and increased amortization of purchased intangible assets for customer relationships,
as we reduced the estimated life of these intangibles. These increases were partially offset by the
impact of headcount reductions initiated in 2023, including the elimination of certain employee and consulting positions and reductions
of other discretionary operating expenses during 2023. We expect that total SG A expense will remain flat or slightly decrease for
the remainder of 2024 compared with 2023 due to our continued cost reduction initiatives.

In
November 2023, we implemented an employee lay-off and terminated certain consulting positions (the Reductions to reduce
operating expenses and cash burn, as we prioritized business activities and projects that we believe will have a higher return on investment.
As part of the Reductions, we implemented a temporary lay-off that impacted 16 employees (the Employees of Peraso Tech.
During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we determined that we would not recall any of the 11 Employees that remained on our payroll
and commenced notifying the remaining Employees that their employment would be terminated. As a result, we recorded severance charges
of approximately 0.4 million for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. 

As
a result of the decision to not recall the Employees, we determined that it was probable that a number of our non-cancelable licenses
for computer-aided design software would not be utilized during the remaining license terms. During the three months ended June 30, 2024,
we expensed the value of the remaining contractual liabilities and recorded liabilities of approximately 1.6 million.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources; Changes in Financial Condition 

Cash Flows 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.3 million and working capital of 0.4 million. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 3.9 million for the first nine months of 2024, which primarily resulted from our net loss of 9.2
million, as adjusted for a 1.6 million non-cash gain on the change in fair value of warrant liability, as partially offset by non-cash
charges of 3.0 million of depreciation and amortization, 3.3 million of stock based compensation and 0.6 million in net changes in
assets and liabilities. The changes in assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of accruals for software licenses, accrued
severance benefits and accounts receivable collections, and other vendor payables and prepayments. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 5.6 million for the first nine months of 2023, which primarily resulted from our net loss of 7.9
million, as adjusted for a 4.2 million non-cash gain on the change in fair value of warrant liability and 0.2 million in other non-cash
changes, and was partially offset by non-cash charges of 2.8 million of depreciation and amortization and 3.9 million of stock based
compensation. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represented 1.1 million in proceeds
from maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by 0.1 million of purchases of property and equipment. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, no cash was provided by or used in investing activities. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities of 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily comprised 3.4 million in
net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants completed in February 2024 and a 0.1 million
sale of unregistered stock to a member of our board of directors, 0.2 million of net proceeds from at-the-market sales of stock, which
was partially offset by 0.1 million for repayment of finance lease liabilities. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 3.5 million, which primarily comprised
 3.6 million in net proceeds from a registered direct offering of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants completed in September
2023, as partially offset by taxes paid to net share settle equity awards and repayment of finance lease liabilities. 

Our
future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on numerous factors, including: 

level of revenue; 

cost, timing and success
 of technology development efforts; 

inventory levels, as supply
 chain disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic required us to maintain higher inventory levels and place purchase orders with our
 suppliers longer into the future, which exposes us to additional inventory risk; 

timing of product shipments,
 which may be impacted by supply chain disruptions; 

length of billing and collection
 cycles, which may be impacted in the event of a global recession or economic downturn; 

fabrication costs, including
 mask costs, of our ICs, currently under development; 

variations in manufacturing
 yields, material lead time and costs and other manufacturing risks; 

costs of acquiring other
 businesses and integrating the acquired operations; and 

profitability of our business. 

30 

Purchase
Obligations 

Our
primary purchase obligations include non-cancelable purchase orders for inventory. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding non-cancelable
purchase orders for inventory, primarily wafers and substrates, and related expenditures of approximately 2.9 million. 

Going
Concern - Working Capital 

We
incurred net losses of approximately 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 16.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2023, and we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 175.6 million as of September 30, 2024. These and prior year losses have
resulted in significant negative cash flows and have required us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital. To date, we have
primarily financed our operations through offerings of equity and equity-linked securities, issuance of convertible notes and loans. 

We
expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to secure new customers for and continue to invest
in the development of our products, and we expect our cash expenditures to continue to exceed receipts for the foreseeable future, as
our revenues will not be sufficient to offset our operating expenses. We will need to increase revenues beyond the levels that we have
attained in the past in order to generate sustainable operating profit and sufficient cash flows to continue doing business without raising
additional capital from time to time. 

As
a result of our expected operating losses and cash burn and recurring losses from operations, if we are unable to raise sufficient capital
through additional equity or debt arrangements, there will be uncertainty regarding our ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate
our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date
of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements presented in Part I,
Item 1 of this Report have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, and do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that such additional capital, whether in the form of equity or
debt financing, will be sufficient or available and, if available, that such capital will be offered on terms and conditions acceptable
to us. We are currently seeking additional financing in order to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. If we are unsuccessful
in these efforts, we will need to implement additional cost reduction strategies, which could further affect our near- and long-term
business plan. These efforts may include, but are not limited to, reducing headcount and curtailing business activities. In 2023, we
implemented cost-reduction initiatives, including headcount reductions, to reduce operating expenses. 

As
discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report,
on November 5, 2024, we entered into inducement offer letter agreements (the Inducement Letters with certain holders (the
 Holders of existing Series B warrants (the Existing Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,246,030
shares of our common stock, having an original exercise price of 2.25 per share, issued to the Holders on February 8, 2024. Pursuant
to the Inducement Letters, the Holders agreed to exercise for cash their existing warrants at a reduced exercise price of 1.30 per share
(the Reduced Exercised Price in consideration for our agreement to issue in a private placement (i) new Series C common
stock purchase warrants (the Series C Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,246,030 shares of common stock, and (ii)
new Series D common stock purchase warrants (the Series D Warrants and, collectively with the Series C Warrants, the New
Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,246,030 shares of our common stock. In connection with this offering, we also agreed to
reduce the exercise price of the Existing Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,728,490 shares of common stock for all holders of the
Existing Warrants not participating in this offering to the Reduced Exercise Price for the remaining term of the Existing Warrants. 

Further,
as discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report,
on August 30, 2024, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann 
Co. Inc. Ladenburg with respect to an at the market offering program, under which the Company may,
from time to time, in its sole discretion, issue and sell through Ladenburg, acting as agent or principal, shares of the Company s
common stock initially having an aggregate offering price of up to 1,425,000. The Sales Agreement provides that Ladenburg will be entitled
to compensation for its services equal to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from sales of any shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement
in addition to the reimbursement of certain expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, under the Sales Agreement, we
sold 110,688 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 164,000. 

31 

As
we have and may raise additional capital through sales of our equity securities, our stockholders will suffer dilution of their equity
ownership. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness,
prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our stock or making investments, and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other
ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise
it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things: 

develop or enhance our
 products; 

continue to expand our
 product development and sales and marketing organizations; 

acquire complementary technologies,
 products or businesses; 

expand operations, in the
 United States or internationally; 

hire, train and retain
 employees; or 

respond to competitive
 pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. 

Discontinuing
any of the above-mentioned activities could seriously harm our ability to execute our business strategy and may force us to curtail our
existing operations. 

We
believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, plus the proceeds from the warrant inducement offering
and expected receipts associated with forecasted product sales, will provide us with liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into
the second quarter of 2025. Variability in our operating forecast, driven primarily by (i) product sales and collections, (ii) potential
customer licensing and non-recurring engineering (NRE) transactions, (iii) timing of operating expenditures, and (iv) unanticipated changes
in net working capital, will impact our cash runway. Likewise, we may decide to revise our financial priorities and operating plans,
depending on the level of customer shipments, licensing and NRE arrangements and timing of related collections. This could impact our
ability to enter into strategic arrangements and to access additional capital. 

We
will need additional funding to continue our operating activities beyond those activities currently included in our operating forecast
and related cash projection. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital or financing and/or significantly delay, defer or reduce
our cash expenditures over the next two quarters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or financing
on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect
on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 

32 

Indemnifications 

In
the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter-party from
losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties, a failure to perform certain covenants, or claims and losses arising from
certain external events as outlined within the contract, which may include, for example, losses arising from litigation or claims relating
to past performance. Such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have also entered into indemnification
agreements with our officers and directors. No material amounts related to these indemnifications are reflected in our condensed consolidated
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Accounting Pronouncements

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial
reporting. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30,
2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II OTHER
INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. Legal Proceedings 

The
discussion of legal matters in Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1
of this report under the heading Legal Matters is incorporated by reference in response to this Part II, Item
1. 

ITEM
1A. Risk Factors 

We
face many significant risks in our business, some of which are unknown to us and not presently foreseen. These risks could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. Other than as set forth below, t here
have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed under Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023, which we filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. 

If we are unable to satisfy the continued listing
requirements of the Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted and the price and liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected. 

Our common stock may lose value
and could be delisted from Nasdaq due to several factors or a combination of such factors. While our common stock is currently listed
on Nasdaq, we can give no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq in the future, including,
but not limited to, the corporate governance requirements and the minimum closing bid price requirement or the minimum equity requirement. 

Specifically, as of September
30, 2024, our stockholders equity was below Nasdaq s 2.5 million minimum stockholders equity continued listing requirement.
However, we believe that, as a result of our receipt of net proceeds of approximately 2.6 million from the warrant inducement offering
in November 2024, our current stockholders equity is now above such requirement. If we are unable to demonstrate to Nasdaq s
satisfaction that we subsequently regained compliance with this requirement, Nasdaq will notify us of such non-compliance. If we receive
such notice from Nasdaq, in accordance with Nasdaq rules, we will have 45 calendar days from the date of the notification to submit a
plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). If our compliance plan is accepted, we may be granted up to 180 calendar
days from the date of the initial notification to evidence compliance. 

There can be no assurance that
we will be able to maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements for Nasdaq. If we fail to maintain compliance with any
such continued listing requirement, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with any such continued listing
requirement in the future or that our common stock will not be delisted in the future. 

If we were to be delisted, we
would expect our common stock to be traded in the over-the-counter market which could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.
Additionally, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability
of market quotations for our common stock; 

a decreased ability to
issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; 

reduced liquidity for
our stockholders; 

potential loss of confidence
by customers, collaboration partners and employees; and 

loss of institutional
investor interest. 

In the event of a delisting, we
can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become
listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the
Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. 

We
might not be able to continue as a going concern. 

Our
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern
for the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.3 million and an accumulated deficit of
 175.6 million. In November 2024, we completed a warrant inducement offering for estimated net proceeds of approximately 2.6 million.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, plus the proceeds from the warrant inducement offering
completed in November 2024 and expected receipts associated with forecasted product sales, will enable us to meet our capital needs until
the second quarter of 2025. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital and to achieve sustainable revenues
and profitable operations. We will need to increase revenues substantially beyond levels that we have attained in the past in order to
generate sustainable operating profit and sufficient cash flows to continue doing business without raising additional capital from time
to time. As a result of our expected operating losses and cash burn for the foreseeable future and recurring losses from operations,
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital through additional debt or equity arrangements, there will be uncertainty regarding our
ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue
as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us. 

If
we are unable to generate sustainable operating profit and sufficient cash flows, then our future success will depend on our ability
to raise capital. We cannot be certain that raising additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities
or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. If we issue
additional securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock,
and our current stockholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be
required to curtail our current product development programs, cut operating costs, forego future development and other opportunities
or even terminate our operations. 

Our
forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operating requirements is a forward-looking
statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors
discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023. We have based this estimate on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and changing circumstances beyond
our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. Our inability to obtain additional funding when
we need it could seriously harm our business. 

34 

We
intend to discontinue the production of our memory products. 

Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, is the sole foundry that manufactures the wafers used to produce our memory IC products.
TSMC has informed us that it is discontinuing the foundry process used to produce the wafers necessary to produce our memory ICs. We
are not in a position to transition wafer production to a new foundry and continue to manufacture these products. As
a result, in May 2023, we initiated an end-of-life, or EOL, o f our memory IC products. We
expect to fulfill EOL product purchase orders by March 31, 2025. However, the timing of EOL shipments will be dependent on the potential
receipt of additional purchase orders from customers, deliveries from our suppliers, and the delivery schedules requested by our customers.
 Our memory IC products represented over 60 of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 and over 80 of our revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The discontinuation of the production and sale of our memory IC products will negatively
impact our future revenues, gross margins, results of operations and cash flows. 

We
have a history of losses, and we will need to raise additional capital. 

We
incurred net losses of approximately 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 16.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, and we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 175.6 million as of September 30, 2024. These and prior-year
losses have resulted in significant negative cash flows. To remain competitive and expand our product offerings to customers, we will
need to increase revenues substantially beyond levels that we have attained in the past in order to generate sustainable operating profit
and sufficient cash flows to continue doing business without raising additional capital from time to time. Given our history of fluctuating
revenues and operating losses, and the challenges we face in securing customers for our products, we cannot be certain that we will be
able to achieve and maintain profitability on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future. As a result, we may need to raise additional
capital in the future, which may or may not be available to us at all or only on unfavorable terms. 

Our
recent reduction in force undertaken to significantly reduce our ongoing operating expenses may not result in our intended outcomes and
may yield unintended consequences and additional costs. 

In
November 2023, we implemented an employee lay-off and terminated certain consulting positions (the Reductions to reduce
operating expenses and cash burn, as we prioritized business activities and projects that we believe will have a higher return on investment.
As part of the Reductions, we implemented a temporary lay-off that impacted 16 employees (the Employees of Peraso Tech.
During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we determined that we would not recall any of the 11 Employees that remained on our payroll
and commenced notifying the remaining Employees that their employment would be terminated. As a result, we recorded severance charges
of approximately 0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and, as of September 30, 2024, we had a remaining liability
for severance costs of approximately 0.3 million. The accrued severance costs are expected to be paid through October 2025. 

As
a result of the decision to not recall the Employees, we determined that it was probable that a number of our non-cancelable licenses
for computer-aided design software would not be utilized during the remaining license terms. During the three months ended June 30, 2024,
we expensed the value of the remaining contractual liabilities and recorded liabilities of approximately 1.6 million. As of September
30, 2024, we had a remaining liability of approximately 1.0 million, and we expect to pay these license fees through September 30, 2025. 

In
addition to the costs associated with the non-cancelable license commitments for computer-aided design software, the Reductions may result
in other unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond the intended
number of employees, decreased morale among our remaining employees, and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
the Reductions. In addition, while positions have been eliminated certain functions necessary to our operations remain, and we may be
unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. We may also be unsuccessful
in negotiating any desired strategic alternative or partnership relating to such functions on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or
at all. The Reductions could also make it difficult for us to pursue, or prevent us from pursuing, new opportunities and initiatives
due to insufficient personnel, or require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs to hire new personnel to pursue such opportunities
or initiatives. Further, inflationary pressure may increase our costs, including employee compensation costs, or result in employee attrition
to the extent our compensation does not keep up with inflation, particularly if our competitors compensation does. If we are unable
to realize the anticipated benefits from the Reductions, if we experience significant adverse consequences from the reduction in force,
or if we are otherwise unable to retain our employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially
adversely affected. 

35 

Failure
to comply with laws relating to employment could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. 

We
are subject to various employment-related laws in the jurisdictions in which our employees are based. We face risks if we fail to comply
with applicable U.S. federal or state employment and wage laws, or employment wage laws applicable to our employees located in Canada.
The Reductions create an additional risk of claims being made on behalf of affected employees. Recently, the Company has received and,
may in the future receive, claims made on behalf of employees, whom were part of the Reductions, regarding statutory and common law severance
payments. If such claims are successful and not mitigated by employment practices insurance coverage, our required payments may be higher
than we have initially estimated. In addition, any violations of applicable wage laws or other labor- or employment-related laws could
result in complaints by current or former employees, adverse media coverage, investigations, and damages or penalties which could have
a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any such proceeding
may result in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources, significant defense costs, and other professional
fees. 

We
currently maintain and may expand operations outside of the United States which exposes us to significant risks. 

The
success of our business depends, in large part, on our ability to operate successfully from geographically disparate locations and to
further expand our international operations and sales. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management
attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that are different from those we face in the United States. We
cannot be sure that further international expansion will be successful. In addition, we face risks in doing business internationally
that could expose us to reduced demand for our products, lower prices for our products or other adverse effects on our operating results.
The success and profitability, as well as the expansion, of our international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
many of which are outside of our control, such as the following: 

public
 health issues, such as pandemics and epidemics, which can result in varying impacts to our
 business, employees, partners, customers, distributors or suppliers internationally; 

difficulties,
 inefficiencies and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; 

longer
 and more difficult customer qualification and credit checks; 

greater
 difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; 

the
 need for various local approvals to operate in some countries; 

difficulties
 in entering some foreign markets without larger-scale local operations; 

changes
 in import/export laws, trade restrictions, regulations and customs and duties and tariffs
 (foreign and domestic); 

compliance
 with local laws and regulations; 

unexpected
 changes in regulatory requirements; 

reduced
 protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 

adverse
 tax consequences, including potential additional tax exposure if we are deemed to have established
 a permanent establishment outside of the United States; 

the
 effectiveness of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Foreign
 Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar regulations; 

fluctuations
 in currency exchange rates, which could increase the prices of our products to customers
 outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations by reducing
 the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk
 if, in the future, we denominate our international sales in currencies other than the U.S.
 dollar; 

new
 and different sources of competition; 

political,
 economic, and social instability; 

terrorism
 and acts of war, which could have a negative impact on the operations of our business or
 the businesses of our customers and vendors; and 

US
 Department of Commerce regulations or restrictions on exports of certain semiconductor products
 and technologies. 

Our
failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our operations and reduce our revenue.
