The following tables show the Company s gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in thousands): 

The Company s mortgage-backed securities have contractual terms that generally do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. The change in fair value of these securities is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and the Company does not have the intent to sell and does not believe it will more likely than not be required to sell any of these securities prior to a recovery of their fair value to amortized cost. Therefore, the Company does not have an allowance for credit losses for these investments as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 There were no credit losses recognized during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were no sales during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The following disclosures show the hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observations utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. The three broad levels of pricing are as follows: 
 
 Level I: Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. 
 Level II: Pricing inputs are other than the quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these assets and liabilities includes items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently and items that are fair-valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. 
 Level III: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
 
 This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. 
 
 The methods of determining the fair value of assets and liabilities presented in this note are consistent with our methodologies disclosed in Note 19 of the Company s 2023 Form 10 -K, as the fair value of loans, excluding previously presented impaired loans measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. The discount rates used to determine fair value use interest rate spreads that reflect factors such as liquidity, credit and non-performance risk. Loans are considered a Level 3 classification. 
 
 The following is a discussion of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis and valuation techniques applied: 
 
 Investment Securities Available For Sale: The fair value of securities available for sale are determined by using matrix pricing (Level 2 ), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. 
 
 We may be required from time to time to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
 
 Individually Evaluated Loans: Individually evaluated loans are carried at the lower of cost or the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans less estimated costs to sell. Collateral is primarily in the form of real estate. The use of independent appraisals, discounted cash flow models and management s best judgment are significant inputs in arriving at the fair value measure of the underlying collateral and impaired loans are therefore classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 

The table below sets forth the financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for on a recurring and nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2024 in thousands):

 General 
 
 The Company was formed in connection with the Bank s conversion to a stock savings bank completed on July 3, 2007. The Company s results of operations are dependent primarily on the results of the Bank, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, along with the Bank s wholly owned subsidiaries. The Bank s results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and the cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by provisions for credit losses, fee income and other non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest expense principally consists of compensation, directors fees and expenses, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, professional fees, advertising expense, FDIC deposit insurance assessment, and other expenses. Our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Bank has six wholly-owned subsidiaries, Quaint Oak Mortgage, LLC, Quaint Oak Real Estate, LLC, Quaint Oak Abstract, LLC, QOB Properties, LLC, Quaint Oak Insurance Agency, LLC, and Oakmont Commercial, LLC, each a Pennsylvania limited liability company. The mortgage company offers mortgage banking primarily in the Lehigh Valley, Delaware Valley and Philadelphia County regions of Pennsylvania. The abstract company offers title abstract services primarily in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. As of September 30, 2024, the real estate company was inactive. These companies began operation in July 2009. In February, 2019, Quaint Oak Mortgage opened a mortgage banking office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. QOB Properties, LLC began operations in July 2012 and holds Bank properties acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Quaint Oak Insurance Agency, LLC began operations in August 2016 and provides a broad range of personal and commercial insurance coverage solutions. Oakmont Commercial, LLC was formed in October 2021 and operates as a multi-state specialty commercial real estate financing company. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. Critical accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods. 
 
 There were no changes made to the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 
 General . The Company s total assets at September 30, 2024 were 701.6 million, a decrease of 52.5 million, or 7.0 , from 754.1 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease in total assets was primarily due to a 70.4 million, or 11.4 , decrease in loans receivable, net of allowance for credit losses. Partially offsetting the decrease in total assets was a 34.4 million, or 94.4 , increase in loans held for sale, a 3.3 million, or 5.8 , increase in cash and cash equivalents, an 899,000, or 25.7 , increase in accrued interest receivable, a 380,000, or 25.8 , increase in investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock, at cost, and a 275,000, or 10.4 , increase in premises and equipment, net. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 3.3 million, or 5.8 , from 58.0 million at December 31, 2023 to 61.3 million at September 30, 2024, with the expectation that excess liquidity will be used to fund loans. 
 
 Investment in Interest-Earning Time Deposits. Investment in interest-earning time deposits decreased 1.0 million, or 52.3 , from 1.9 million at December 31, 2023 to 912,000 at September 30, 2024 as four interest-earning time deposits matured and were not renewed and one interest-earning time deposit was purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale. Investment securities available for sale decreased 500,000, or 21.4 , from 2.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 1.8 million at September 30, 2024, due primarily to the principal repayments on these securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

32

Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale increased 34.4 million, or 94.4 , from 36.4 million at December 31, 2023 to 70.9 million at September 30, 2024 as the Bank originated 51.5 million in equipment loans held for sale and sold 71.6 million of equipment loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Partially offsetting this increase was 8.5 million of loan amortization and prepayments. On March 29, 2024, the Bank transferred 4.4 million of equipment loans held for sale into loans receivable as part of the discontinued operations of OCH. Additionally, the Bank s mortgage banking subsidiary, Quaint Oak Mortgage, LLC, originated 99.6 million of one-to-four family residential loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and sold 93.1 million of loans in the secondary market during this same period. In the third quarter of 2024, management identified 51.0 million of commercial real estate loans and 9.9 million of SBA loans within the loan portfolio and transferred to loans held for sale at amortized cost which was less than fair value. 
 
 Loans Receivable, Net . Loans receivable, net, decreased 70.4 million, or 11.4 , to 547.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 617.7 million December 31, 2023. The largest decreases within the loan portfolio occurred in commercial real estate loans which decreased 31.0 million, or 9.4 , commercial business loans which decreased 23.4 million, or 16.5 , construction loans which decreased 11.7 million, or 32.9 , and one-to-four family non-owner occupied loans which decreased 6.2 million, or 15.3 . Partially offsetting these decreases were one-to-four family owner occupied loans which increased 1.5 million, or 6.4 , and multi-family residential which increased 783,000, or 1.7 . 
 
 Deposits. Total deposits decreased 48.3 million, or 7.6 , to 583.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 631.7 million at December 31, 2023. This decrease in deposits was primarily attributable to a decrease of 36.5 million, or 35.0 , in interest bearing checking accounts, a decrease of 23.8 million, or 25.8 , in non-interest bearing checking accounts, a decrease of 5.5 million, or 2.5 , in money market accounts, and a 236,000, or 28.1 , decrease in savings accounts. These decreases in deposits were partially offset by an increase of 17.6 million, or 8.2 , in certificates of deposit. The total decrease in interest bearing checking accounts was due to reduced correspondent banking activity. 
 
 The total amount of our uninsured deposits (deposits in excess of 250,000, as calculated in accordance with FDIC regulations) was 146.6 million, or 25.1 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Borrowings. Total Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings increased 9.8 million, or 33.9 , to 38.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 29.0 million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 65.0 million of FHLB short-term borrowings, paid down 25.2 million of FHLB long-term borrowings, and paid down 30.0 million of FHLB short-term borrowings. 
 
 Stockholders Equity . Total stockholders equity from continuing operations increased 2.9 million, or 6.0 , to 51.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 48.5 million at December 31, 2023. Contributing to the increase was net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.2 million, shares issued of 2.4 million, amortization of stock awards and options under our stock compensation plans of 182,000, the reissuance of treasury stock under the Bank s 401(k) Plan of 91,000, and other comprehensive income, net of 11,000. The increase in stockholders equity was partially offset by dividends paid of 996,000, and 48,000 purchase of treasury stock. In addition, there was a 3.1 million, or 100.0 , decrease in noncontrolling interest from discontinued operations. The 2.4 million of shares issued were due to two private placement offerings to two investors.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. Net income amounted to 243,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 498,000, or 195.3 , compared to net loss of 255,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income on a comparative quarterly basis was primarily the result of a decrease in interest expense of 427,000, a decrease in net loss from discontinued operations of 300,000, a decrease in non-interest expense of 221,000, an increase in non-interest income of 188,000, and a decrease in the provision for credit losses of 134,000, partially offset by a decrease in interest income of 639,000, and an increase in the net provision for income taxes of 133,000. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 212,000, or 4.8 to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a 639,000, or 5.8 , decrease in interest income, partially offset by a 427,000, or 6.4 , decrease in interest expense. 
 
 Interest Income. The 639,000, or 5.8 , decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of loans receivable, net, which decreased 114.7 million from 722.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 607.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and had the effect of decreasing interest income 1.7 million. This decrease was partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in the average yield on loans receivable, net from 6.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.51 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and had the effect of increasing interest income 767,000, and a 39.3 million increase in the average balance of due from banks interest bearing, which increased from 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 45.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and had the effect of increasing interest income 413,000. 
 
 Interest Expense. The 427,000, or 6.4 , decrease in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the comparable period in 2023 was driven by a 751,000, or 95.9 , decrease in the interest on Federal Home Loan Bank short-term borrowings due to a 52.4 million, or 97.1 , decrease in the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank short-term borrowings which decreased from 54.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Also contributing to the decreases in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 310,000, or 83.3 , decrease in the interest on Federal Home Loan Bank long-term borrowings due to a 33.7 million, or 81.0 , decrease in the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank long-term borrowings which decreased from 41.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was a 573,000, or 11.3 , increase in interest expense on deposits, primarily attributable to a 92 basis point increase in average rate of certificates of deposit, which increased from 3.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.27 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and had the effect of increasing interest expense by 513,000. The average interest rate spread increased from 1.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.87 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 while the net interest margin increased from 2.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 (1) Includes loans held for sale. 
 (2) Includes non-accrual loans during the respective periods. Calculated net of deferred fees and discounts, loans in process and allowance for credit losses. 
 (3) Equals net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The 134,000, or 52.1 , decrease in the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a decrease in the average balance of loans receivable, net, partially offset by an increase in individually evaluated loans which increased the provision for credit losses by 259,000. 
 
 Non-Interest Income. The 188,000, or 18.4 , increase in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 over the comparable period in 2023 was primarily attributable to a 122,000, or 32.0 , increase in net gain on sale of loans, a 79,000, or 50.0 , increase in mortgage banking, equipment lending, and title abstract fees, a 29,000, or 30.5 , increase in gain on sale of SBA loans, and an 8,000, or 4.2 , increase in insurance commissions. These increases were partially offset by a 38,000, or 24.7 , decrease in other fees and service charges, and a 16,000, or 100.0 , decrease in real estate sales commissions, net. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense decreased 221,000, or 4.3 , from 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a 229,000, or 89.8 , decrease in professional fees, a 116,000, or 26.0 , decrease in occupancy and equipment expense, a 56,000, or 51.9 , decrease in directors fees and expenses, and a 39,000, or 19.8 , decrease in FDIC deposit insurance assessment. These decreases were partially offset by a 182,000, or 5.5 , increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a 27,000, or 5.7 , increase in other expense, and a 10,000, or 3.2 , increase in data processing expense. The decrease in professional fees included a 98,000 recovery of legal fees due to a loan payoff. 

35

Provision for Income Tax. The provision for income tax from continuing operations increased 133,000, or 380.0 , from 35,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 168,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to an increase in taxable income from continuing operations. 
 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 General. Net income amounted to 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 338,000, or 38.5 , compared to net income of 878,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income on a comparative quarterly basis was primarily the result of a decrease in net loss from discontinued operations of 1.0 million, an increase in non-interest income of 1.0 million, a decrease in non-interest expense of 207,000, and a decrease in the net provision for income taxes from continuing operations of 132,000, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 849,000, an increase in the provision for credit losses of 758,000, and a decrease in interest income of 442,000. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 1.3 million, or 8.6 to 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by an 849,000, or 4.5 , increase in interest expense, and a 442,000, or 1.3 , decrease in interest income. 
 
 Interest Income. The 442,000, or 1.3 , decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of loans receivable, net, which decreased 123.7 million from 748.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 624.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had the effect of decreasing interest income 5.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by a 59 basis point increase in the yield on average loans receivable, net, including loans held for sale, which increased from 5.91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.50 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and had the effect of increasing interest income 2.7 million, and a 66.7 million increase in the average balance of due from banks interest bearing, which increased from 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 72.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and had the effect of increasing interest income 2.1 million, and a 93 basis point increase in the average yield on due from banks interest bearing which increased from 4.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.13 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and had the effect of increasing interest income 504,000. 
 
 Interest Expense. The 849,000, or 4.5 , increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the comparable period in 2023 was driven by a 4.5 million, or 34.1 , increase in interest on average deposits. Also contributing to the increase in interest expense was a 51 basis point increase in the rate on average money market accounts which increased from 4.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had the effect of increasing interest expense by 828,000. Partially offsetting the increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a 3.6 million, or 99.1 , decrease in the interest on Federal Home Loan Bank short-term borrowings due to an 89.3 million, or 99.0 , decrease in the average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank short-term borrowings which decreased from 90.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 861,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average interest rate spread decreased from 2.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 while the net interest margin decreased from 2.62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.61 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Provision for Credit Losses. The 758,000, or 164.8 , increase in the provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in the amount of non-performing loans. There were nineteen individually evaluated loans which increased the provision for credit losses by 913,000. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans receivable, net. 
 
 Non-Interest Income. The 1.0 million, or 33.5 , increase in non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 over the comparable period in 2023 was primarily attributable to a 790,000, or 65.4 , increase in net gain on sale of loans, a 286,000, or 96.6 , increase in other fees and services charges, a 206,000, or 48.9 , increase in mortgage banking, equipment lending, and title abstract fees, and a 40,000, or 8.2 , increase in insurance commissions. These increases were partially offset by a 143,000 or 96.6 , decrease in net loan servicing income, a 95,000, or 27.5 , decrease in gain on sale of SBA loans, and a 68,000, or 77.3 , decrease in real estate sales commissions, net. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense. Total non-interest expense decreased 207,000, or 1.3 , from 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a 274,000, or 45.9 , decrease in professional fees, a 175,000, or 26.2 , decrease in FDIC deposit insurance assessment, a 162,000, or 51.4 , decrease in directors fees and expenses, and a 142,000, or 12.5 , decrease in occupancy and equipment expense. The decrease in directors fees and expenses was primarily due to a reduction in directors' Board meeting and committee meeting fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in non-interest expense was partially offset by a 394,000, or 3.8 , increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, and a 157,000, or 21.3 , increase in data processing expense. 
 
 Provision for Income Tax. The provision for income tax on continuing operations decreased 132,000, or 20.4 , from 648,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 516,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to a decrease in taxable income from continuing operations. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and to a lesser extent, loan sales and other funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal and interest payments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Company sets the interest rates on its deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, the Company invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets that provide additional liquidity. At September 30, 2024, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to 61.3 million. 
 
 The Company uses its liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments, to fund deposit outflows, to invest in other interest-earning assets and to meet operating expenses. At September 30, 2024, Quaint Oak Bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans of 24.3 million, commitments under unused lines of credit of 64.9 million, and 1.7 million under standby letters of credit. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled 129.0 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. 
 
 In addition to cash flow from loan payments and prepayments and deposits, the Company has significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs. If the Company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB), which provide an additional source of funds. As of September 30, 2024, we had 38.9 million of borrowings from the FHLB and had 294.3 million in borrowing capacity. Under terms of the collateral agreement with the FHLB of Pittsburgh, we pledge residential mortgage loans as well as Quaint Oak Bank s FHLB stock as collateral for such advances. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, Quaint Oak Bank had 14.8 million in borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. 

38

The Company identified one major interest bearing checking account deposit customer and one major money market deposit customer, a separate customer than the interest bearing checking account deposit customer, that accounted for approximately 11.6 and 25.7 of total deposits at September 30, 2024, respectively. The combined outstanding balances of the two major deposit customers totaled approximately 217.8 million at September 30, 2024. If these deposits were to be withdrawn in whole or in part, replacement of the funds may require us to pay higher interest rates on retail deposits or brokered deposits which would have an adverse effect on our net interest income and net income. The replacement of these deposits with other sources of funding such as borrowings could also increase our overall cost of funds and would negatively impact our results of operations. The Company has significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity needs, including borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia described above. 
 
 Any requirements that we increase our capital ratios or liquidity could require our seeking additional sources of capital through a capital raise that would necessitate issuing additional securities, which could dilute our outstanding shares of our common stock. We may also liquidate certain assets, perhaps on terms that are unfavorable to us or contrary to our business plan. In March 2024, we sold our 51 ownership interest in OCH, and recognized a 1.4 million gain on sale. Quaint Oak Bank is in the process of closing a sale/leaseback transaction on its property that it owns at 1710 Union Blvd, Allentown, PA 18109. For further discussion of the transaction, see Note 12 - Subsequent Event in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere herein. We may also raise capital through the issuance of preferred stock and senior or subordinated debt. 
 
 The Company and Quaint Oak Bank are subject to the regulation and supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, each of which may impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or incur additional indebtedness. As the subsidiary of a stock saving and loan holding company, Quaint Oak must file a notice with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank at least 20 days before a proposed declaration of a dividend to the Company. Under applicable banking regulations, Quaint Oak Bank must file an application for FDIC approval of a capital distribution if: the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed the sum of Quaint Oak Bank s net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years; Quaint Oak Bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or FDIC-imposed condition; or Quaint Oak Bank is not otherwise eligible for expedited treatment of its filings with the FDIC. The inability to pay dividends from Quaint Oak Bank to the Company could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders, pay interest on our debt or engage in stock repurchases. The Company currently is restricted in declaring or paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases or directly or indirectly, incurring, increasing, or guaranteeing any debt, including any interest payments due on subordinated debentures, without the prior written approval of the FRB. To date, the FRB has approved all requests to pay dividends and interest on subordinated debt, however, no assurance can be given that such approvals will be received in the future.

Total stockholders equity from continuing operations increased 2.9 million, or 6.0 , to 51.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 48.5 million at December 31, 2023. Contributing to the increase was net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.2 million, shares issued of 2.4 million, amortization of stock awards and options under our stock compensation plans of 182,000, the reissuance of treasury stock under the Bank s 401(k) Plan of 91,000, and other comprehensive income, net of 11,000. The increase in stockholders equity was partially offset by dividends paid of 996,000, and 48,000 purchase of treasury stock. In addition, there was a 3.1 million, or 100.0 , decrease in noncontrolling interest from discontinued operations. The 2.4 million of shares issued were due to two private placement offerings to two investors. 
 
 For further discussion of the stock compensation plans, see Note 10 in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere herein. 
 
 Quaint Oak Bank is required to maintain regulatory capital sufficient to meet tier 1 leverage, common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 4.00 , 4.50 , 6.00 , and 8.00 , respectively. At September 30, 2024, Quaint Oak Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with ratios of 10.49 , 12.64 , 12.64 and 13.89 , respectively. As a small savings and loan holding company eligible for exemption, the Company is not currently subject to any regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. Our exposure to credit loss from non-performance by the other party to the above-mentioned financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. In general, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with off balance sheet credit risk. 
 
 Commitments. At September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments under lines of credit of 64.9 million, 24.3 million of commitments to originate loans, and 1.7 million under standby letters of credit. We had no commitments to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding lines of credit or undisbursed construction loans. 
 
 The ACL for off balance sheet credit exposures is recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This ACL represents management s estimate of expected losses in its unfunded loan commitments and other off balance sheet credit exposures, such as letters of credit and credit recourse on sold residential mortgage loans. The balance of off balance sheet credit exposures was a recovery of 9,000 at September 30, 2024.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the Company s performance than does the effect of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Not Applicable. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are operating in an effective manner. 
 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company is not involved in any pending legal proceedings other than routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business, which involve amounts in the aggregate believed by management to be immaterial to the financial condition and operating results of the Company. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes in the Risk Factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K.
