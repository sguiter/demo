Included in unbilled receivables are retention receivables of million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, which become payable upon the completion of the contract or completion of our fieldwork and formal hearings. Unbilled receivables expected to be collected within one year have been included with the current portion of accounts receivable in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Unbilled receivables and retention receivables expected to be collected past one year have been included with long-term portion of accounts receivable in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 We maintain allowances for losses and sales adjustments, which losses are recorded against revenue at the time the loss is incurred. Because most of our clients are domestic governmental entities, we rarely incur a credit loss resulting from the inability of a client to make required payments. Consequently, we have not recorded a reserve for credit losses. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount for the allowances for losses and sales adjustments may require revision include, but are not limited to, managing our client s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products. Our allowances for losses and sales adjustments are million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 reportable segments. Business units that have met the aggregation criteria have been combined into our reportable segments. The Enterprise Software ES reportable segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical back-office functions such as: public administration solutions; courts and public safety solutions; education solutions; and property and recording solutions. The Platform Technologies PT reportable segment provides public sector entities with platform and transformative solutions including digital solutions, payment processing, streamlined data processing, and improved operations and workflows. 
 We evaluate performance based on several factors. The primary financial measure is business segment operating income. We define segment operating income for our business units as income before non-cash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisitions, interest expense, and income taxes. Segment operating income includes intercompany transactions. The majority of our intercompany transactions relate to contracts involving more than one business unit and are valued based on the contractual arrangement. Corporate segment operating loss primarily consists of compensation costs for the executive management team, certain shared services staff, and share-based compensation expense for the entire company. Corporate segment operating loss also includes revenues and expenses related to a company-wide user conference.

 2024 Credit Agreement 
 On September 25, 2024, the Company entered into a million credit agreement with the various lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender, and Issuing Lender (the 2024 Credit Agreement ). The 2024 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to million, including subfacilities for standby letters of credit and swingline loans. The 2024 Credit Agreement matures on September 25, 2029, and loans may be prepaid at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to certain minimum amounts and payment of any SOFR breakage costs. The Company incurred issuance fees of million in connection with the 2024 Credit Agreement.

 The 2024 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of defaults. The 2024 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and limits us from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. 
 Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at the Company s option, at a per annum rate of either (1) the Administrative Agent s prime commercial lending rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) plus a margin of to or (2) the one-, three-, or six-month SOFR rate plus a margin of to . The margin in each case is based upon Tyler s total net leverage ratio, as determined pursuant to the 2024 Credit Agreement. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal of loans under the revolving credit facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee initially in the amount of per annum, ranging from to based upon the Company s total net leverage ratio. Borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, acquisitions and capital expenditures.

 during the consecutive business days immediately after any consecutive trading day period (such consecutive trading day period, the Measurement Period if the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, as determined following a request by their holder in accordance with the procedures in the Indenture, for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; 
 upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock, including but not limited to a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture); 
 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or 
 on or after September 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, March 15, 2026. 
 With certain exceptions, upon a change of control or other fundamental change (both as defined in the Indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes), the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.

In addition, calling any Note for redemption constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.

 As described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , we assess goodwill for impairment annually on October 1. In addition, we review goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed our annual assessment of goodwill which did not result in an impairment charge. Further, in 2024 we identified no indicators of impairment to goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangibles. Therefore, no impairment was recorded as of or for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Financial instruments measured at fair value only for disclosure purposes 
 The carrying amount of the Term Loan under the 2021 Credit Agreement is the par value less the debt discount and debt issuance costs that are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Term Loan. Interest expense is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 The fair value of our Convertible Senior Notes is determined based on quoted market prices for a similar liability when traded as an asset in an active market, a Level 2 input. See Note 8, Debt, for further discussion. 
 The carrying amount of the Convertible Senior Notes is the par value less the debt discount and debt issuance costs that are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. Interest expense is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income.

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, is due to an increase in excess tax benefits related to stock incentive awards in the current year and lower non-deductible business expenses and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an increase in state taxes and lower research tax credit benefits. 
 The effective income tax rates for the periods presented are different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock incentive awards, offset by state income taxes, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and non-deductible business expenses.

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as believes, expects, anticipates, foresees, forecasts, estimates, plans, intends, continues, may, will, should, projects, might, could or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward-looking statements, but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward-looking statements. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs: (1) changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our clients, primarily local and state governments, that could negatively impact information technology spending; (2) disruption to our business and harm to our competitive position resulting from cyber-attacks, security vulnerabilities and software updates; (3) our ability to protect client information from security breaches and provide uninterrupted operations of data centers; (4) our ability to achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses, while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations; (5) material portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be adequately maintained; (6) our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors, including project delays by our clients, reductions in transaction size, fewer transactions, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements; (7) general economic, political and market conditions, including continued inflation and rising interest rates; (8) technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services; (9) competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing, client retention and pressure for new products or services; (10) the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with rising labor costs, the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel; and (11) costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations. These factors and other risks that affect our business are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors . We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements. 
 GENERAL 
 We provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector. We develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the IT needs of public sector entities. We provide subscription-based services such as software as a service SaaS and transaction-based services primarily related to digital government services and payment processing. In addition, we provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and for certain clients, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for clients using our systems. Additionally, we provide property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions . 
 We report our results in two reportable segments. Business units that have met the aggregation criteria have been combined into our two reportable segments. The Enterprise Software ES reportable segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical back-office functions such as: public administration solutions; courts and public safety solutions; education solutions; and property and recording solutions. The Platform Technologies PT reportable segment provides public sector entities with platform and transformative solutions including digital solutions, payment processing, streamlined data processing, and improved operations and workflows. 
 We evaluate performance based on several factors. The primary financial measure is business segment operating income. We define segment operating income for our business units as income before non-cash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisitions, interest expense, and income taxes. Segment operating income includes intercompany transactions. The majority of our intercompany transactions relate to contracts involving more than one business unit and are valued based on the contractual arrangement. Corporate segment operating loss primarily consists of compensation costs for the executive management team, certain shared services staff, and share-based compensation expense for the entire company. Corporate segment operating loss also includes revenues and expenses related to a company-wide user conference. 
 See Note 3, Segment and Related Information, in the notes to the financial statements for additional information.

Recent Acquisitions 
 2024 
 We did not complete any acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 2023 
 On October 31, 2023, we acquired Resource Exploration, Inc. ResourceX ), a leading provider of budgeting software to the public sector. Also on October 31, 2023, we acquired ARInspect, Inc. ARInspect ), a leading provider of AI-powered machine learning solutions for public sector field operations. On August 8, 2023, we acquired Computing System Innovations, LLC CSI ), a leading provider of artificial intelligence automation, redaction, and indexing solution for courts, recorders, attorneys, and others. 
 The actual operating results of CSI and ResourceX are included in the operating results of the ES segment from their respective dates of acquisition. The operating results of ARInspect are included in the operating results of the PT segment since the date of acquisition. 
 Operating Result s 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues increased 10 and 9 , respectively, compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue. Revenues from recent acquisitions contributed 3.0 million, or 1 , and 9.8 million, or 1 , to the total revenue increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior period. 
 Subscriptions revenue grew 18 and 14 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior period, primarily due to an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements for both new and existing clients, along with growth in certain transaction-based revenues. 
 Our backlog as of September 30, 2024, was 2.13 billion, a 9 increase compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Our total employee count increased to 7,386 as of September 30, 2024, including 50 employees who joined us through acquisitions completed since September 30, 2023, from 7,301 as of September 30, 2023. 
 Annualized Recurring Revenues 
 Subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources. Annualized recurring revenues (ARR) are calculated by annualizing the current quarter s recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions as reported in our statement of income. Management believes ARR is an indicator of the annual run rate of our recurring revenues, as well as a measure of the effectiveness of the strategies we deploy to drive revenue growth over time. ARR is a metric we believe is widely used by companies in the technology sector and by investors, which we believe offers insight to the stability of our maintenance and subscription revenues to be recognized within the year, which are considered recurring in nature, with some seasonality. 
 Subscriptions revenues primarily consist of revenues derived from our SaaS arrangements and transaction-based fees. These revenues are considered recurring because revenues from these sources are expected to re-occur in similar annual amounts for the term of our relationship with the client. Transaction-based fees are generally the result of multi-year contracts with our clients that result in fees generated by payment transactions and digital government services and are collected on a recurring basis during the contract term. Transaction-based revenues are historically highest in the second quarter, which coincides with peak outdoor recreation seasons and statutory filing deadlines in many jurisdictions, and lowest in the fourth quarter due to fewer business days and lower transaction volumes around holidays. Because ARR is an annualized revenue amount, the metric can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to this seasonality. 
 ARR was 1.85 billion and 1.65 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. ARR increased 12 compared to the prior period primarily due to an increase in subscriptions revenue resulting from an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements for both new and existing clients and expansion in transaction-based fees.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared following the requirements of GAAP for the interim period and require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, potential impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, and share-based compensation expense. As these are condensed financial statements, one should also read expanded information about our critical accounting policies and estimates provided in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Revenues 
 Subscriptions 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 ES 206,006 165,923 40,083 24 577,778 468,889 108,889 23 PT 141,164 129,267 11,897 9 416,317 404,555 11,762 3 Total subscriptions revenue 347,170 295,190 51,980 18 994,095 873,444 120,651 14 
 29 

Subscriptions revenue consists of revenue derived from our SaaS arrangements and transaction-based fees primarily related to digital government services and payment processing. We also provide electronic document filing ("e-filing") solutions for which revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed-fee arrangements. 
 Subscriptions revenue grew 18 and 14 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior period, primarily due to an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements, along with growth in certain transaction-based revenues. Subscription revenues from recent acquisitions contributed 1.3 million, or 0.4 , and 3.8 million, or 0.4 , to the increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Total subscriptions revenue derived from SaaS fees was 166.6 million and 471.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 138.5 million and 387.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, SaaS fees grew 20 , or 28.1 million, and 22 , or 84.4 million, respectively, compared to prior period. New SaaS clients as well as existing on-premises clients who converted to our SaaS model provided the majority of the subscriptions revenue increase. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we added 181 and 584 new SaaS clients, respectively, and 108 and 309 existing on-premises clients, respectively, elected to convert to our SaaS model. Since September 30, 2023, we have added 740 new SaaS clients, while 401 existing on-premises clients have converted to our SaaS offerings. Our new software contract mix for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 11 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 89 subscription-based arrangements, compared to approximately 19 perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 81 subscription-based arrangements for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Total subscriptions revenue derived from transaction-based fees was 180.6 million and 522.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 156.7 million and 486.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, transaction-based fees for both periods grew 15 , or 23.9 million, and 7 , or 36.3 million, respectively, compared to prior period. Contributing to the growth in transaction-based fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are the new transaction customers and volume increases from online payments and e-filing services, as well as the impact of transaction-based fees from recent acquisitions of 1.3 million and 3.8 million, respectively, compared to prior period. These increases compared to prior period are partially offset by a change from the gross revenue model to the net revenue model for payments revenue under one of our state enterprise agreements that results in merchant fees recorded as a reduction in revenue rather than as cost of revenues. 
 Maintenance 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 ES 109,346 111,574 (2,228) (2) 329,724 331,609 (1,885) (1) PT 6,241 5,910 331 6 18,390 17,545 845 5 Total maintenance revenue 115,587 117,484 (1,897) (2) 348,114 349,154 (1,040) 
 We provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third-party software. Maintenance revenue decreased 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, maintenance revenue declined primarily due to the impact of clients converting from on-premises license arrangements to SaaS, partially offset by maintenance price increases. 
 Professional services 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our professional services revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 ES 53,947 52,413 1,534 3 167,571 159,168 8,403 5 PT 10,515 8,713 1,802 21 33,625 29,307 4,318 15 Total professional services revenue 64,462 61,126 3,336 5 201,196 188,475 12,721 7 
 30 

Professional services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software, converting client data, training client personnel, custom development activities, consulting, and property appraisal services. New clients who implement our software generally contract with us to provide the related professional services. Existing clients also periodically purchase additional training, consulting and minor programming services. 
 Professional services revenue increased 5 and 7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior period. The increase is primarily attributable to higher new contract volume along with increased billing rates. 
 Software licenses and royalties 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 ES 5,424 7,531 (2,107) (28) 19,314 25,078 (5,764) (23) PT 764 3,023 (2,259) (75) 937 5,385 (4,448) (83) Total software licenses and royalties revenue 6,188 10,554 (4,366) (41) 20,251 30,463 (10,212) (34) 
 Software licenses and royalties revenue decreased 41 and 34 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior period. The decrease is primarily attributed to the shift in the mix of new software contracts toward more SaaS. 
 Although the mix of new contracts between subscription-based and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year, we expect that software license revenues will continue to decline as we shift our model away from perpetual licenses to SaaS. Subscription-based arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements, but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract. 
 
 Cost of revenues and overall gross margin 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Subscriptions, maintenance, and professional services 283,750 247,781 35,969 15 829,765 755,985 73,780 10 Software licenses and royalties 1,870 3,120 (1,250) (40) 4,995 7,865 (2,870) (36) Amortization of software development 4,961 3,083 1,878 61 13,808 8,568 5,240 61 Amortization of acquired software 9,244 9,035 209 2 27,723 26,879 844 3 Hardware and other 6,052 6,505 (453) (7) 21,439 23,346 (1,907) (8) Total cost of revenues 305,877 269,524 36,353 13 897,730 822,643 75,087 9 
 31 

Subscriptions, maintenance, and professional services. Cost of subscriptions, maintenance and professional services primarily consist of personnel costs related to installation of our software, conversion of client data, training client personnel and support activities, including enhancing existing solutions, and various other services such as custom development, ongoing operation of SaaS, property appraisal outsourcing activities, digital government services, and other transaction-based services such as e-filing. Other costs included are interchange fees required to process credit/debit card transactions and bank fees to process automated clearinghouse transactions related to our payments business. 
 The cost of subscriptions, maintenance, and professional services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 36.0 million, or 15 , and 73.8 million, or 10 , respectively, compared to the prior period. The impact from recent acquisitions was 1.3 million and 5.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The remaining subscriptions, maintenance and professional services expenses increased 14 and 9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to increased hosting costs as we expand our SaaS client base and transition from our proprietary data centers to the public cloud, together with higher personnel costs. Our professional services staff grew by 127 employees since September 30, 2023, as we increased hiring to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business. The increases were partially offset by a reduction in merchant fees associated with the change from the gross model to the net model for payments revenue under one of our state enterprise agreements. 
 Software licenses and royalties. Costs of software licenses and royalties primarily consist of direct third-party software costs. We do not have any direct costs associated with royalties. 
 The cost of software licenses and royalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 1.3 million, or 40 , and 2.9 million, or 36 , respectively, compared to the prior period due to lower third-party software costs. 
 Amortization of software development. Software development costs included in cost of revenues primarily consist of personnel costs. We begin to amortize capitalized costs when a product is available for general release to customers. Amortization expense is determined on a product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the software s remaining estimated economic life of, generally, three to five years. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization of software development costs increased 1.9 million, or 61 , and 5.2 million, or 61 , respectively, compared to the prior period, and is attributable to new capitalized software development projects going into service in the past year. 
 Amortization of acquired software. Amortization expense related to acquired software attributed to business combinations is included with cost of revenues. The estimated useful lives of other intangibles range from five to 10 years. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization of acquired software increased 2 , or 0.2 million, and 3 , or 0.8 million, respectively, compared to the prior period, due to amortization of newly acquired software from recent acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by assets becoming fully amortized in the fourth quarter 2023. 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of overall gross margin for the periods presented as of September 30: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Overall gross margin 43.7 45.5 (1.8) 43.8 44.1 (0.3) 
 Overall Gross Margin . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our overall gross margin decreased 1.8 and 0.3 , respectively, compared to the prior period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, the decline in the overall gross margin compared to prior period is attributed to lower revenue from software licenses and maintenance, higher software development amortization expense, and higher personnel costs. The decline in overall gross margin compared to the prior period was partially offset by a higher revenue mix for subscription revenues compared to the prior period, resulting in an increase in incremental margin related to software services, maintenance and subscriptions.

Sales and marketing expense 
 Sales and marketing S M expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, share-based compensation expense, commissions and related overhead costs for sales and marketing employees, as well as professional fees, trade show activities, advertising costs and other marketing costs. The following table sets forth a comparison of our S M expense for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales and marketing expense 38,203 35,898 2,305 6 116,195 110,104 6,091 6 
 S M expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.0 and 7.3 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.3 and 7.5 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, S M expense increased approximately 6 , compared to the prior period. The increase in S M expense is primarily attributed to higher bonus, commission, and trade show expenses, offset by lower professional fees related to marketing and advertising. 
 General and administrative expense 
 General and administrative G A expense consists primarily of personnel salaries and share-based compensation expense for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, as well as third-party professional fees, travel-related expenses, insurance, allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, amortization of software development for internal use, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses. The following table sets forth a comparison of our G A expense for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 General and administrative expense 72,460 78,519 (6,059) (8) 220,590 228,560 (7,970) (3) 
 G A expense as a percentage of revenue was 13.3 and 13.8 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.9 and 15.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. G A expense decreased 8 and 3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in G A expense, compared to prior period, is primarily attributed to lower facilities costs resulting from lease restructurings, along with lower depreciation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decline in G A expense is primarily attributed to lower facilities costs resulting from lease restructurings, partially offset by higher share-based compensation costs and an increase in software and other IT support costs. 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development. Research and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies. 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Research and development expense 30,120 28,282 1,838 6 88,504 83,421 5,083 6 
 Research and development expense increased 6 , for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period, mainly due to a number of product development initiatives shifting from capitalized development projects to projects that are expensed to research and development.

Amortization of other intangibles 
 Other intangibles represents the portion of purchase price allocated to the identified intangible assets for customer-related intangibles, trade names and leases acquired. The remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues, while amortization expense of other intangibles is recorded as operating expense. The estimated useful lives of other intangibles range from one to 25 years. The following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of other intangibles for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amortization of other intangibles 13,850 18,526 (4,676) (25) 45,813 55,300 (9,487) (17) 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, amortization of other intangibles decreased compared to the prior period due to the impact of certain trade name intangible assets becoming fully amortized as a result of accelerated amortization expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 and partially in 2024. 
 Interest expense 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest expense (1,235) (5,808) 4,573 (79) (4,672) (19,879) 15,207 (76) 
 Interest expense is comprised of interest expense and non-usage and other fees associated with our borrowings . The change in interest expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to lower interest incurred as a result of our repayment of the Term Loans. 
 Other income, net 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our other income, net, for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other income, net 4,504 787 3,717 472 8,232 2,676 5,556 208 
 Other income, net, is primarily comprised of interest income from invested cash. The change in other income, net, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period is due to increased interest income generated from higher invested cash balances and higher interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Income tax provision 
 The following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30 in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended Change Nine Months Ended Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income tax provision 
 10,199 11,903 (1,704) (14) 33,595 26,570 7,025 26 Effective income tax rate 11.8 20.2 14.5 17.3 
 34 

The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior period, is due to an increase in excess tax benefits related to stock incentive awards in the current year and lower non-deductible business expenses and liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an increase in state taxes and lower research tax credit benefits. 
 The effective income tax rates for the periods presented are different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 21 primarily due to research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock incentive awards, offset by state income taxes, liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and non-deductible business expenses. 
 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 538.3 million, compared to 165.5 million as of December 31, 2023. We also had 9.9 million invested in investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities as of September 30, 2024. These investments have varying maturity dates through 2027 and are held as available-for-sale. We believe our cash on hand, cash from operating activities, availability under our revolving line of credit, and access to the capital markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our long-term financial needs. 
 The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30: 
 2024 2023 Cash flows provided (used) by: Operating activities 399,859 233,021 Investing activities (34,673) (40,610) Financing activities 7,617 (234,782) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 372,803 (42,371) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. Other potential capital resources include cash on hand, public and private issuances of debt or equity securities, and bank borrowings. It is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors. We believe that our cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities provided cash of 399.9 million. Operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of 197.8 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of 108.8 million, non-cash share-based compensation expense of 88.5 million, and non-cash amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of 7.3 million. Changes in working capital, excluding cash, decreased cash provided by operating activities by approximately 2.7 million, mainly due to higher accounts receivable, timing of prepaid expenses, timing of payments for operating leases, and deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period. These decreases were offset by an increase in deferred revenue during the period and an increase of income tax payable due to the timing of payments. In general, changes in deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance and subscription renewal billings. Our renewal dates occur throughout the year, but our largest maintenance billing cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters. Subscription renewals are billed throughout the year. 
 Investing activities used cash of approximately 34.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We received 7.7 million in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities. Approximately 24.4 million of software development costs were capitalized. Approximately 16.7 million was invested in property and equipment, including 7.5 million related to real estate. The remaining additions were for computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of growth. We also paid 1.4 million for working capital holdbacks related to acquisitions completed in 2023. 
 Financing activities used cash of 7.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is attributable to repayment of 50.0 million of term debt, partially offset by 47.4 million in payments received from stock option exercises, net of withheld shares for taxes upon equity awards settlement and 12.8 million in contributions from employee stock purchase plan activity. 
 35 

In February 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of our common stock. The repurchase program, which was approved by our board of directors, was originally announced in October 2002 and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2019. As of October 23, 2024, we have authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to 2.2 million additional shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion. Market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased, as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises. Share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions, privately negotiated transactions and/or other mechanisms. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization. 
 On September 25, 2024, the Company entered into a 700.0 million credit agreement with the various lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender, and Issuing Lender (the 2024 Credit Agreement ). The 2024 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 700.0 million including subfacilities for standby letters of credit and swingline loans. The 2024 Credit Agreement matures on September 25, 2029, and loans may be prepaid at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to certain minimum amounts and payment of any SOFR breakage costs. The Company incurred issuance fees of 2.6 million in connection with the 2024 Credit Agreement. The 2024 Credit Agreement replaces Tyler s existing 500.0 million unsecured credit facility under the credit agreement dated April 21, 2021, among the Company and various lenders party thereto (the 2021 Credit Agreement ), which was scheduled to mature in April 2026. 
 We repaid all amounts due under the Term Loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement and have no outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement, with an available borrowing capacity of 700.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 600.0 million in outstanding principal for the Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we paid interest of 2.9 million and 16.8 million, respectively. See Note 8, Debt, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussions of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2024 Credit Agreement. 
 We made income tax payments, net of refunds, of 45.7 million and 118.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock option exercise activity generated net tax benefits of 17.2 million and reduced tax payments accordingly, as compared to 5.6 million in the same period in 2023. 
 We anticipate that 2024 capital spending will be between 47.0 million and 49.0 million, including approximately 7.6 million related to real estate and approximately 31.0 million of software development. We expect the majority of the other capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion. Capital spending and cash tax payments are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations. 
 We lease office facilities, transportation, and other equipment for use in our operations. Most of our leases are non-cancelable operating lease agreements with remaining terms of one to 10 years. Some of these leases include options to extend for up to six years. 
 Other than the accelerated repayment of 50.0 million of the Term Loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement, there were no material changes to our future minimum contractual obligations since December 31, 2023, as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. Our estimated future obligations consist of debt, uncertain tax positions, leases, and purchase commitments as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 8, Debt, Note 12, Income Tax, Note 15, Leases, and Note 17, Commitment and Contingencies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for related discussions. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and interest rates. 
 In accordance with the 2024 Credit Agreement, the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company s option, at a per annum rate of either (1) the Administrative Agent s prime commercial lending rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) plus a margin of 0.125 to 0.75 or (2) the one-, three-, or six-month SOFR rate plus a margin of 1.125 to 1.75 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement and therefore are not subject to any interest risk. 
 36 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. These include controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company completed its second phase implementation for our new accounting and financial management software effective July 1, 2024, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related business processes. The second phase implementation was not made in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. The second phase implementation was subject to various testing and review procedures prior to and after execution. We have updated our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate any modifications to our business processes or accounting procedures due to the implementation. Management will continue to monitor, test and evaluate the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the new accounting and financial management software during the post-implementation period to ensure that effective controls over financial reporting continue to be maintained. 
 Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 37 

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 During the first quarter of 2022, we received a notice of termination for convenience under a contractual arrangement with a state government client. Upon receipt of the termination notice, we ceased performing services under the contractual arrangement and sought payment of contractually owed fees of approximately 15 million in connection with the termination for convenience. 
 The client was unresponsive to our outreach for several months, and on August 23, 2022, we filed a lawsuit to enforce our rights and remedies under the applicable contractual arrangement. The client subsequently asked us to negotiate directly with the client to attempt to resolve the dispute. The negotiations were not successful, and on March 20, 2024, we reinitiated our lawsuit. Although we believe our products and services were delivered in accordance with the terms of our contract and that we are entitled to payment in connection with the termination for convenience, at this time the matter remains unresolved. We can provide no assurances that we will not incur additional costs as we pursue our rights and remedies under the contract. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, one should carefully consider the discussion of various risks and uncertainties contained in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe those risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Please note, however, that those are not the only risk factors facing us. Additional risks that we do not consider material, or of which we are not currently aware, may also have an adverse impact on us. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs or materializes. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in the information regarding risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
