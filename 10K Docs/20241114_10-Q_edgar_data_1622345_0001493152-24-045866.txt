. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, our independent
registered public accounting firm, in its audit report to the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023, expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of , with borrowing capacity of , stockholders equity of ,
and working capital of . The long-term continuation of the Company s business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient
revenues from its products to offset expenses. In the event that the Company does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations
and is unable to obtain funding, the Company will be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate some or all of its discretionary spending,
which could adversely affect the Company s business prospects, ability to meet long-term liquidity needs or ability to continue
operations.

ITEM
2. Management s Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements
and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical
information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our
actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in
this report. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period, and results for
any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except share and per-share data and where otherwise noted. 

Overview 

We
design, manufacture, and sell DC power generators, renewable energy and cooling systems for applications primarily in the telecommunications
market and, to a lesser extent, in other markets, including military, electric vehicle, marine and industrial. We are continuously diversifying
our customer base and are selling our products into non-telecommunication markets and applications at an increasing rate. The changes
in customer diversity are reported in the financial section. 

Within
the various markets we service, our DC power systems provide reliable and low-cost DC power to service applications that do not have
access to the utility grid (i.e., prime power and mobile applications) or have critical power needs and cannot be without power in the
event of utility grid failure (i.e., back-up power applications). 

We
believe it is more efficient to build power systems around the DC generator because it is then simpler to integrate it with battery storage
and solar photovoltaics which also operate on DC. Many applications in communications, water pumping, lighting, vehicle and vessel propulsion,
security systems operate on DC power only. Many micro-grids and energy storage are DC-based and use inverters to convert the DC to AC. 

Serving
these various markets, we offer the following configurations of our DC power systems, with output power ranging from 5 kW to 50 kW: 

Base
 power systems . These stationary systems integrate a DC generator and automated controls with remote monitoring, which are
 typically contained within an environmentally regulated enclosure. 

Hybrid
 power systems . These systems incorporate lithium-ion batteries (or other advanced battery chemistries) with our proprietary
 battery management system into our standard DC power systems. 

DC
 solar hybrid power systems . These stationary systems incorporate photovoltaic and other sources of renewable energy into
 our DC hybrid power systems. 

Mobile
 power systems. These are very light weight and compact power systems used for EV charging, robotics, communications and security. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 91 and 96 , respectively, of our total net sales were within the
telecommunications market. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sales to international
customers accounted for 10 and 1 of total net sales, respectively; sales to military customers accounted for 8 and 0 of total
net sales, respectively; and sales to other customers accounted for 2 and 4 of total net sales, respectively. 

15 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 90 and 96 , respectively, of our total net sales were within the telecommunications
market. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, sales to international customers accounted for 15 and
24 of total net sales, respectively; sales to military customers accounted for 9 and 3 of total net sales, respectively; and sales
to other customers accounted for 2 and 1 of total net sales, respectively. 

We
continue to expand our customer base internationally and across the various markets we service. Sales of our DC power systems to
customers in international markets averaged over 20 of total net revenues per annum in the last two years. Prior to this, sales to
international customers averaged less than 10 of total revenues per annum. We have several telecommunications customers in the
South Pacific region, purchasing our DC generators to develop the telecommunications infrastructure in this region. We believe the
implementation and ongoing development of broadband networks along with programs to develop the telecommunications infrastructure in
rural and underdeveloped countries will continue to fuel our growth in the telecommunications market over the next five to ten
years. 

During
2023, we launched our prime power DC generators incorporating the Toyota 1KS engines optimized for propane, natural gas, and extremely
long operational life. We believe that with the increasing installation restrictions on small diesel engines along with their limited
availability due to stringent EPA regulations will force a change to natural gas and propane (LPG) generators. LPG and natural gas are
lower in cost than diesel fuel in many areas throughout the world. Our new LPG and natural gas generators will provide strong opportunities
for growth and diversification in line with our long-term plan. 

Solar
combined with the Toyota 1KS and 4Y engines along with our alternators and controls offer clean and renewable energy for applications
including HVAC, refrigeration, EV charging, peak power shaving, off grid power, and backing up the grid for home and business. 

In
May 2023, we announced plans to expand our mobile offerings by upgrading our mobile CHAdeMO EV chargers to the universal combined charging
system standard to reach the mobile EV charging market. We expect to complete upgrading our EV chargers by the end of the fourth quarter
2024. Mobile EV chargers are used for emergency roadside service providing a fast-charging solution for EVs that have run out of charge
before reaching a stationary charging facility. 

We
also continue to market our DC generators for the military, advanced mobility and marine markets as part of our ongoing customer diversification
strategy. The military s increasing use of robotics, drones, and computerization in the field is driving the demand for battery
charging with DC generators. Military sales are advantageous because they typically represent long-term contracts, and they tend to cover
the cost of product development. Marine sales interest have increased significantly both domestically and overseas due to the increased
performance in comfort and fuel economy. Also, there are increasing restrictions on the use of diesel and gasoline engines in many lakes
and waterways making way for our natural gas and propane operated generators. Using natural gas and propane for home and office charging
for electric vehicle and forklifts is still a market under development. Same is true for diesel mobile chargers for emergency roadside
assistance. 

We
expect that opportunities in the bad-grid (i.e., areas where wireless towers are connected to an electrical grid that loses power for
more than eight hours), and off-grid (i.e., areas where wireless towers are not connected to an electrical grid) applications, which
include telecommunications towers, commercial and residential backup power, electric vehicle charging, mini-grid and various
other power applications, will help to expand the market for our natural gas/LPG (propane) product lines domestically and internationally.
We plan to develop new configurations of DC power system, battery storage and solar products to optimize the match between our solutions
and various application needs.

Effects
of Inflation 

The
impact of inflation and rapidly changing prices has not impacted our operations during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024. Rapid changes in the global economy may cause significant spikes in inflation which may have an impact in our financial condition
during 2024 and beyond. Very small portion of our sales is a result of fixed contracts thereby resulting in negligible impact on our
gross profits. 

Recent
Business Events 

Our
sales backlog as of September 30, 2024 was 3,118, of which our telecommunications customers accounted for 69 , customers in military
markets accounted for 17 , customers in the marine markets accounted for 13 , and customers in other markets accounted for 1 . 

In
July 2024, Michael Field was appointed a director of the Company. Mr. Field joins our Board of Directors and serves in our audit committee,
compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board. He is the chair of the compensation committee
and chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board. Mr Field has over four decades of experience in global manufacturing
and equipment spanning engineering and technology development, lean manufacturing, factory and systems integration, product management
and channel development. He has held key operating and managerial roles and positions both at the divisional and executive levels at
UTC Carrier Corporation, PRI Automation and Brooks Automation, and is currently the President and CEO of The Raymond Corporation, which
is in the materials handling market. 

Based on
the appointment of Michael Field to our Board of Directors, audit committee and compensation committee, we regained compliance with the
audit and compensation committee requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Listing Rules 5605(c)(2)
and 5605(d)(2). 

On November
11, 2024, we held our annual meeting of stockholders. At the meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation,
in substantially the form attached to the proxy statement as Appendix A to allow the Board of Directors to effect, in its discretion prior
to December 31, 2024, a reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, at a specific
ratio, ranging from one-for-three (1:3) to one-for-twenty (1:20), with the timing and ratio to be determined by the Board if effected.
On November 11, 2024, our Board approved a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-seven (1:7) (the Reverse Stock Split ).
We plan to effect the Reverse Stock Split with the market effective date of November 19, 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of the Company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Some of those judgments can
be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates
the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances,
historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to assumptions used in reserves for uncollectible
receivables, inventory reserves and returns, impairment analysis of long-term assets, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, income
tax accruals, accruals for potential liabilities and warrant reserves and assumptions made in valuing equity instruments issued for services.
There were no changes to our critical accounting policies described in the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that impacted our condensed financial statements and related notes included herein.

Financial
Performance Summary and Outlook 

Our
net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4,914, which represents a 157 increase in net sales, as compared to
 1,911 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross margins for the three-month period in 2024 improved to 29.0 , up
from a negative 5.7 at the same period in 2023. We achieved our second consecutive profitable quarter in over two years with a net
profit of 13 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 1,844 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

17 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net sales were 11,348, as compared to 11,688 for the same period in 2023. Gross margins
in 2024 were 25.1 , as compared to 18.2 in 2023. Our net loss was 1,628 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 3,393 for the same period in 2023. 

We
continue to add large customers as a result of our progress in diversifying our customer base. Two customers added this year represented
18 and 12 of our total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We have also seen an increase in sales to customers
in military markets as compared to last year. Sales to military customers accounted for 8 of our total net sales for the quarter ended
September 2024, as compared to zero sales in the same period in 2023. 

We
believe we are making significant progress in diversifying our customer base by pursuing opportunities to new markets, such as homes
and apartment buildings, electric vehicles and drones, greenhouses, pools, and more, for clean fuel and solar hybrid DC power generation. 

See
 Risk Factors commencing on page 24 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional considerations. 

Results
of Operations 

The
tables presented below, which compare our results of operations from one period to another, present the results for each period, the
change in those results from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change, and the results for each period as a percentage
of net revenues. The columns present the following: 

The
 first two data columns in each table show the absolute results for each period presented. 

The
 columns entitled Dollar Variance and Percentage Variance shows the change in results, both in dollars
 and percentages. These two columns show favorable changes as a positive and unfavorable changes as negative. For example, when our
 net revenues increase from one period to the next, that change is shown as a positive number in both columns. Conversely, when expenses
 increase from one period to the next, that change is shown as a negative in both columns. 

The
 last two columns in each table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenues.

Net
Sales. Net sales increased 3,003, or 157 , to 4,914 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,911 for the
same period in 2023. The increase in sales was primarily due to an increase of 2,641 in sales of our DC generators to customers in the
telecommunications market. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, sales to our three largest telecommunications customers account
for 46 , 18 and 12 of our total net sales, respectively. In the three months ended September 30, 2023, our largest telecommunications
customer represented 65 of total net sales. There was no other revenue from customers in excess of 10 of total net sales in either
period. 

Net
sales to telecommunications customers in the U.S. accounted for 89 of our total net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to 95 for the same period in 2023. Net Sales to military customers represented 8 of total net sales for the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared zero during the same period in 2023. Our international sales represented 10 of our total net sales
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1 in international sales in the same period in 2023. 

Cost
of Sales . Cost of sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1,471, or 73 , to 3,490, as compared to 2,019
during the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily as a result of higher production volumes during the recent quarter. Cost of
sales as a percentage of net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 71.0 as compared to 105.7 in the same
period in 2023 primarily as a result of improvements in labor efficiencies gained on higher production volumes on standard products. 

Gross
Profit. We had a gross profit of 1,424 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is an increase of 1,532 or 1,419 ,
as compared to gross loss of 108 during the same period in 2023. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 29.0 for the quarter
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a gross loss as a percentage of net sales of 5.7 in the same period in 2023. The increase in
gross profit and margins for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result higher revenues, lower labor costs, and
improved factory overhead absorption. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 22, or 8 , to
 252, as compared to 274 during the same period in 2023. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales support staff and travel
related expenses during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased by 127,
or 42 , to 172, as compared to 299 during the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research and development
support staff and consulting services during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. We plan
to recruit additional engineers during 2024 to support new product developments and our customer diversification efforts. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses decreased by 32, or 3 , to 960 during the three months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 992 during same period in 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative staff. 

Interest
and Finance Costs . Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 153, as compared to 171 during the same period
in 2023. The decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a decrease in borrowing from our line of credit with Pinnacle Bank Pinnacle during the current period. 

Net
Income (Loss). As a result of the factors identified above, we reported net income of 13, or 0.00 per basic and diluted share,
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loss of 1,844, or (0.14) per basic and diluted share, for the
same period in 2023.

Net
Sales. Net sales decreased 340, or 3 , to 11,348 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11,688 for the same
period in 2023. The decrease in sales was primarily attributed to shortages in manufacturing staff during the second quarter of 2024
and a slow start in shipments at the beginning of the year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales to our largest telecommunication
customer in the U.S. accounted for 44 of our total net sales, our second largest customer being a telecommunications customer in Puerto
Rico represented 17 of our total net sales. For the same period in 2023, 52 of our total net sales were generated from our largest
U.S. telecommunications customer, and 22 of our total net sales were generated from our second largest customer being a telecommunications
customer in the South Pacific Islands. There was no other revenue from customers in excess of 10 of total net sales in either period. 

Net
sales to telecommunications customers in the U.S. accounted for 78 of our total net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to 72 for the same period in 2023. Our international sales represented 15 of our net sales for the nine months ended September

during the same period in 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 74.9 ,
as compared to 81.8 in the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily as a result of improvements in labor efficiencies
gained on higher production volumes on standard products. 

20 

Gross
Profit. Gross profit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 732, or 34 , to gross profit of 2,854, as compared
to gross profit of 2,122 during the same period in 2023. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 25.1 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 18.2 in the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales
was primarily due to lower labor costs and improved factory overhead absorption. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 171, or 19 ,
to 746, as compared to 917 during the same period in 2023. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales support staff and travel
related expenses, as compared to the same period in 2023. 

Research
and Development Expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased by 397, or
40 , to 586, as compared to 983 during the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research and development
support staff and consulting services during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. We plan
to recruit additional engineers during the second half of 2024 to support growth and our customer diversification efforts. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses decreased by 239, or 7 , to 3,001 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,240 during same period in 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative staff, as compared to the same period
in 2023. 

Interest
and Finance Costs . Interest and finance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 496, as compared to 375 during the
same period in 2023, an increase of 121. Our interest expense for the current period resulted primarily from an increase in borrowing
from our line of credit with Pinnacle. 

Net
Loss. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net loss of 1,628, or (0.09) per basic and diluted share, as compared
to net loss of 3,393, or (0.26) per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we funded our operations primarily from cash on hand. As of September 30, 2024, we had working
capital of 10,132, as compared to working capital of 11,775 at December 31, 2023. This 1,643 decrease in working capital is primarily
attributable to 51 decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulting from net cash of 400 used in operating activities, and net cash
of 18 used in investing activities, and net cash of 367 from financing activities. 

On
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our net trade receivables totaled 2,949 and 1,676, respectively. On September 30, 2024, 2,263
(77 ), and 284 (10 represented the two largest open customer account balances, while 1,156 (69 and 264 (16 represented the two
largest open customer account balances on December 31, 2023. 

At
December 31, 2021, we recognized 2,000 related to the ERC for salaries and benefits expenses incurred during 2021 resulting in a refundable
tax credit. The ERC assist business owners and their employees by providing an incentive to keep workers on the payroll and eligible
businesses received a tax credit for a percentage of each eligible employee s wage. In May 2024, we received 2,000 of the ERC
receivable. 

Our
available capital resources on September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of 498 in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to 549 as of
December 31, 2023. We expect our future capital resources will consist primarily of cash on hand, cash generated by operations, if any,
drawdowns on our credit facility with Pinnacle and future debt or equity financings, if any. 

21 

Credit
Facility 

Effective
September 30, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or Loan Agreement, with Pinnacle. The Loan Agreement was amended by
the First Modification to Loan and Security Agreement on October 7, 2020. The Loan Agreement s initial term ended on September
30, 2022. On November 3, 2022, we executed the Second Modification to Loan and Security Agreement with Pinnacle for a two-year term with
an expiration date of September 30, 2024. At October 1, 2024, the Loan Agreement was renewed for another two-year term with
an expiration date of September 30, 2026. 

The
Loan Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility under which Pinnacle may, in its sole discretion upon our request, make advances
to us in an amount, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, of up to (a) 85 of the aggregate net face amount of our accounts
receivable and other contract rights and receivables, plus (b) the lesser of (i) 35 of the lower of cost or wholesale market value of
certain of our inventory or (ii) 2,500. The aggregate amount of the outstanding advances under the revolving credit facility were initially
limited to 4,000. On May 25, 2023, we executed the Fourth Modification to the Loan Agreement to amend the amount of available advances
under the Loan Agreement such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding advances under the revolving credit facility may not be greater
than 6,000 and raised the concentration percentage applicable to certain Tier-1 telecommunication customers from 50 to 75 in the definition
of eligible accounts. 

On
September 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Fifth Modification to the Loan Agreement under which the parties (a) agreed to amend the
amount of available advances under the Loan Agreement such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding advances under the revolving
credit facility may not be greater than seven and a half million dollars 7.5 million), (b) extended the standard of eligibility applicable
to certain Tier-1 telecommunication customers from ninety (90) days to one hundred twenty (120) days of invoice date in the definition
of eligible accounts, (c) increased the inventory advance rate from 35 to 40 of the aggregate eligible inventory value of eligible
inventory, and (d) raised the inventory advance limit from two million dollars 2.0 million) to four million dollars 4.0 million). 

Interest
accrues on the daily balance at a rate of 1.25 above the prime rate, or the Standard Interest Rate, but in no event will the Standard
Interest Rate be less than 3.75 per annum. Interest on the portion of the daily balance consisting of advances against inventory accrues
interest at a rate of 2.25 above the prime rate per annum, or the Inventory Interest Rate, but in no event will the Inventory Interest
Rate be less than 4.75 per annum. The Loan Agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us to attain an effective tangible
net worth, defined as our total assets, excluding all intangible assets, less our total liabilities plus loans to us from our officers,
stockholders or employees that have been subordinated to our obligations to Pinnacle, greater than 6,000 as determined by Pinnacle as
of the end of each fiscal quarter. 

We
have an outstanding balance of 4,661 under the Loan Agreement at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had availability under
the Loan Agreement of 1,432 and we believe that we are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement.

of 3,084 for the same period in 2023. This decrease in net cash used in 2024 was primarily due to a net loss of 1,628, a decrease in
ERC receivable of 2,000, a decrease in refundable income taxes of 787, and a decrease in accounts payable of 1,416. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 18, as compared to net cash used in investing activities
of 194 for the same period in 2023. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to acquisitions of property and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash from financing activities totaled 367 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,363 used by financing activities
during the same period in 2023. This cash provided was primarily borrowings from the line of credit with Pinnacle. 

Backlog 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a sales backlog of 3,118. The amount of backlog represents revenue that we anticipate recognizing in the
future, as evidenced by purchase orders and other purchase commitments received from customers, but on which work has not yet been initiated
or with respect to which work is currently in progress. Backlog at September 30, 2024 was comprised of the following elements: 68 in
purchases of DC power systems by telecommunications customers, 17 in purchases from customers in the military market, 13 in purchases
from customers in the marine market, and 1 in purchases by customers from other markets. The backlog as of September 30, 2024 consisted
of orders 100 from customers in the U.S. We believe the majority of our backlog will be shipped within the next twelve months. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in fulfilling such orders and commitments in a timely manner or that we will ultimately
recognize as revenue the amounts reflected in our backlog.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may be involved in general commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently
involved in legal proceedings that could reasonably be expected to have material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial
condition or results of our operation. 

ITEM
1A. Risk Factors 

Before
deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other
information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms
10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently
known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties
actually occurs with material adverse effects on us, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could
be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 

Risks
Related to Our Business and Industry 

The
COVID-19 pandemic and recovery had a significant negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition
in 2020 to 2022, but to a lesser extent in 2023 and 2024. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic and recovery has had a widespread and detrimental effect on the global economy, particularly in the U.S. since 2020,
but to a lesser extent in 2023 and 2024. The repercussions of COVID-19 and recovery is likely to continue to have, a material and substantial
adverse impact on our results of operations, including a decrease in our sales and delays in sourcing raw materials from suppliers. 

In
addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, which may affect
our level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the
covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness. In the event of a sustained market deterioration and continued declines
in net sales, and other repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery, we may need additional liquidity. The need for additional
liquidity may also be affected by the federal government s potential failure to raise the debt ceiling or correct a prolonged banking
or financial crisis. Such disruptions may impact the broader capital markets, and in turn, may impact our ability to access those markets.
We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain additional sources of financing or liquidity on acceptable terms, or at
all. 

The
ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery on our business and results of operations remains unknown and will depend on future
developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and potential resurgence of
COVID-19, repeat or cyclical outbreaks and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or we, or our customers,
or our suppliers may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption and reduced operations. Any resulting
financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but we expect it will continue to have a material impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. 

24 

Terrorist
attacks and threats of war may impact all aspects of our operations, revenues, costs and stock price in unpredictable ways. 

The
impacts of war and other geopolitical events, including but not limited to Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the Hamas-Israel conflict
and the resulting war, are difficult to predict. The resulting geopolitical uncertainty are likely to have a significant impact on the
European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries, including the U.S. The threat that these military operations may expand beyond
Ukraine, Israel, and the Gaza Strip may have a negative impact as well. Significant increases in the price of oil and natural gas have
occurred and are likely to continue putting additional inflationary pressures on central banks, including Federal Reserve System (the
 FRB ). It is possible that interest rate hikes by the FRB will continue to occur in 2024, but the amount, timing, and frequency
of such increases are not fully known at this time. As a result of these conflicts, the threat of cyberattacks has increased which could
affect banks in the U.S. and their customers. Additionally, the United States and European nations have imposed very significant financial
sanctions on the Russian Federation, including targeted sanctions on Russian banks and wealthy individuals as well as halting certification
of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. They have denied Russian banks access the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
or SWIFT which is expected to slow international trade and make such transactions costlier to accomplish which could also negatively
affect banks in the U.S. and their customers. In response to the Russian military actions, many businesses headquartered in the Eurozone
and the United States have stopped doing business with Russia, which may negatively affect the profitability of those companies. The
international turmoil has already had and may continue to have a negative impact on the stock market generally and, in turn, on our stock
price. 

The
continuation or escalation of events like the war in Russia-Ukraine war or the Hamas-Israel conflict may also disrupt business operations
of our suppliers and/or customers, causing supply chain constraints or delayed spending by our customers. The full impact of such events
are not known at this time, but they could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and stock price. 

We
have incurred significant losses in the past and we may incur losses in the future, which may hamper our operations and impede us from
expanding our business. 

We
have incurred significant losses in the past. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred net loss of approximately 1,628.
For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred consolidated net losses of approximately 6,548 and 5,584, respectively.
In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its audit report to the financial statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We may incur net and gross losses in the future. We expect to rely on cash on hand, cash, if any, generated from our operations, borrowing
availability under our line of credit and proceeds from our future financing activities, if any, to fund all of the cash requirements
of our business. Additional losses may hamper our operations and impede us from expanding our business. 

We
are dependent on, and derive substantially all of our revenue from, sales of our DC base power systems to one customer within the U.S.
telecommunications market. Our efforts to expand our customer base, our product portfolio or markets within which we operate may not
succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. 

We
derive substantially all our revenues from sales of our DC base power systems to one customer within the telecommunications market, AT T.
The volume of sales to them may vary significantly from year to year. Any factor adversely affecting sales of these power systems to
this customer or to other customers within this market, including market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability,
reputation, price competition and economic and market conditions, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

In
addition, any unfavorable change in our business relationship with our Tier-1 telecommunications wireless carrier customers, or delays
in customer implementation and deployment of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial
condition. Our plans to invest in the development of electric vehicle chargers, residential and commercial power products and higher
capacity DC hybrid solar systems may not result in an anticipated growth in sales and may reduce our revenue growth rate. 

Many
of our DC power systems involve long design and sales cycles, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial
performance. 

The
design and sales cycle for our DC power systems, from initial contact with our potential customer to the shipments of our product, may
be lengthy. Customers generally consider a wide range of factors before making a purchase decision. Prior to purchasing our products,
many of our customers often require a significant technical review, tests and evaluations over long periods of time (i.e., three to twenty-four
months), assessments of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within their organization. During the time
our customers are evaluating our products, we may incur substantial sales and service, engineering and research and development expenses
to customize our products to meet customer s application needs. We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing
capacity, order long-lead-time components or purchase significant amounts of components and other inventory prior to receiving an order.
Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products. 

The
product development time before a customer agrees to purchase our DC power systems can be considerable. Our process for developing an
integrated solution may require use of significant engineering resources, including design, prototyping, modeling, testing and application
engineering. The length of this cycle is influenced by many factors, including the difficulty of the technical specification and complexity
of the design and the customer s procurement processes. A significant period may elapse between our investment of time and resources
in designing and developing a product for a customer and receipt of revenue from sales of that product. The length of this process, combined
with unanticipated delays in the development cycles and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery on our ability to demonstrate
our products to current and potential customers could materially affect our results of operations and financial conditions. 

25 

We
do not have long-term commitments for significant revenues with most of our customers and may be unable to retain existing customers,
attract new customers or replace departing customers with new customers that can provide comparable revenues and profits. 

Because
we generally do not obtain firm, long-term volume purchase commitments from our customers, most of our sales are derived from individual
purchase orders. We remain dependent upon securing new purchase orders in the future in order to sustain and grow our revenues. Accordingly,
there is no assurance that our revenues and business will grow in the future. Our failure to maintain and expand our customer relationships
could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

The
current high concentration of our sales within the telecommunications market could result in a significant reduction in sales and negatively
affect our profitability if demand for our DC power systems declines within this market before we are able to make significant inroads
with our diversification of markets and customers. 

Currently,
we are predominately focused on the manufacturing, marketing and sales of DC power systems to telecommunications companies. We may be
unable to shift our business focus away from these activities to other potential markets for our products. Accordingly, the emergence
of new competing DC power products or lower-cost alternative technologies within the telecommunications market may reduce the demand
for our products. A downturn in the demand for our DC power systems within this market could materially and adversely affect our sales
and results of operations. 

We
face inventory risk and may be required to write-off inventory in the future. 

We
value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. If the estimated net realizable value is determined to be less than the
recorded cost of the inventory, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to the lower net realizable value
determination. Determination of the net realizable value may be complex, and therefore, requires management to make assumptions and to
apply a high degree of judgment. In order for management to make the appropriate determination of net realizable value, the following
items are commonly considered: inventory turnover statistics, inventory quantities on hand in our facilities, unfilled customer order
quantities, forecasted consumer demand, current prices, competitive pricing, seasonality factors, consumer trends and performance of
similar products or accessories. Subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded write-downs. 

If
our estimates regarding net realizable value are inaccurate, including our estimates regarding our inventory, or changes in customer
demand for our products in an unforeseen manner, we may experience additional write-downs of our inventory. 

The
unavailability or shortage, or increase in the cost, of raw materials and components could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. 

Our
operations require raw materials, such as aluminum, copper, engines, electronics, and permanent magnets. Commodities such as aluminum
and copper are known to have significant price volatility based on global economic conditions. An increase in global economic outlook
may result in significant price increases in the cost of our raw materials. In addition, we use Neodymium permanent magnets in our alternators,
for which there are a limited number of global suppliers that can meet our standards. Increase in manufacturing of electric vehicles
worldwide can have an adverse effect on the cost or supply of these magnets. At our current production volumes, we are unable to secure
large quantities of these commodities at fixed prices; however, we do have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials to meet our
near term forecasted needs. Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials and components and shortages may occur from
time to time in the future. An increase in lead times for the supply of raw materials due to a global increase in demand for commodities
or other reasons may significantly increase the timing of receipt of such materials and/or increase the material costs of our products.
For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery, we are currently experiencing both delays in sourcing, and price increases
of, certain key components. As a result of these delays, our standard eight-week delivery time has increased to fourteen weeks. In addition,
if production was interrupted due to unavailability or shortage of raw materials and we were not able to find alternate third-party suppliers
or re-engineer our products to accommodate different components or materials, we could experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations
including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs. If our supply of raw materials or components continues to
be disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

The
markets within which we compete are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do
and one or more of these competitors could use their greater financial and other resources to gain market share at our expense. 

If
our business continues to develop as expected, we anticipate that we will grow our revenues in the near future. If, due to capital constraints
or otherwise, we are unable to fulfill our existing backlog in a timely manner and/or procure and timely fulfill our anticipated future
backlog, our customers and potential customers may decide to use competing DC power systems or continue the use of AC power systems.
If we are unable to fulfill the demand for products and services in a timely manner, our customers and potential customers may choose
to purchase products from our competitors. Some of our larger competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in
order to compete with us. In addition, we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established
industrial brands and distribution networks that enter our end markets. Demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to
respond to changes in design and functionality, to respond to downward pricing pressure, and to provide shorter lead times for our products
than our competitors. If we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures, we could lose market share, which could
have an adverse impact on our results. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets or compete effectively
against current and new competitors as our industry continues to evolve. 

26 

Rapid
technological changes may prevent us from remaining current with our technological resources and maintaining competitive product and
service offerings. 

The
markets in which we and our customers operate are characterized by rapid technological change, especially within the telecommunications
market. Significant technological changes could render our existing and potential new products, services and technology obsolete. Our
future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to: 

effectively
 identify and develop leading energy efficient technologies; 

continue
 to develop our technical expertise; 

enhance
 our current products and services with new, improved and competitive technology; and 

respond
 to technological changes in a cost-effective and timely manner. 

If
we are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if we do not respond to it in a cost-effective and timely manner, then
our business will be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding to changing technology.
In addition, technologies developed by others may render our products, services and technology uncompetitive or obsolete. Even if we
do successfully respond to technological advances, the integration of new technology may require substantial time and expense, and we
cannot assure you that we will succeed in adapting our products, services and technology in a timely and cost-effective manner. 

If
we are unable to continue to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner, our competitive
position and operating results could be harmed. 

Our
future success will depend on our ability to continue to develop new and enhanced DC power systems and related products and services
that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. The markets in which we and our customers operate are characterized
by frequent introductions of new and enhanced products and services, evolving industry standards and regulatory requirements, government
incentives and changes in customer needs. The successful development and market acceptance of our products and services depends on a
number of factors, including: 

the
 impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global markets; 

the
 changing requirements and preferences of the potential customers in our markets; 

the
 accurate prediction of market requirements, including regulatory issues; 

the
 timely completion and introduction of new products and services to avoid obsolescence; 

the
 quality, price and performance of new products and services; 

27 

the
 availability, quality, price and performance of competing products and services; 

our
 customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness; 

the
 successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers; and 

changes
 in industry standards. 

We
may experience financial or technical difficulties or limitations that could prevent us from introducing new or enhanced products or
services. Furthermore, any of these new or enhanced products and services could contain problems that are discovered after they are introduced.
We may need to significantly modify the design of these products and services to correct problems. Rapidly changing industry standards
and customer preferences and requirements may impede market acceptance of our products and services. 

Development
and enhancement of our products and services will require significant additional investment and could strain our management, financial
and operational resources. The lack of market acceptance of our products or services or our inability to generate sufficient revenues
from this development or enhancement to offset their development costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition,
we may experience delays or other problems in releasing new products and services and enhancements, and any such delays or problems may
cause customers to forego purchases of our products and services and to purchase those of our competitors. 

We
cannot provide assurance that products and services that we have recently developed or that we develop in the future will achieve market
acceptance. If our new products and services fail to achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to develop new or enhanced products and
services s that achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected. 

Natural
disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us. 

Natural
disasters or other catastrophic events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery, may cause damage or disruption to our operations,
international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject
to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis
management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers
and could decrease demand for our services. 

We
are dependent on relationships with our key material suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these key suppliers, or the
failure to find replacement suppliers or manufacturers in a timely manner, could adversely affect our business. 

We
have established relationships with third party engine suppliers and other key suppliers from which we source components for our
power systems. We purchase standard configurations of engines for our DC power systems and are substantially dependent on timely
supply from our key engine suppliers, Yanmar Engines Company Yanmar ), Toyota Corporation Toyota ), and
Perkins Engines Company Limited Perkins ). Engines from Yanmar, Toyota, and Perkins represented 97 , nil, and 3 of
our total engines sold as a component of our DC power systems during the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and
represented approximately 84 , 5 , and 11 of our total engines sold as components of our DC power systems during the same period in
2023, respectively. Engines from Yanmar, Toyota, and Perkins represented 92 , 1 , and 4 of our total engines sold as a component of
our DC power systems during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and represented approximately 58 , 1 , and 32 
of our total engines sold as components of our DC power systems during the same period in 2023, respectively. We also use engines
from Isuzu, Kubota and, to a lesser extent, Volvo Penta. In March 2023, we received EPA certification on our 4Y Toyota engine, which
is a larger engine model for used on our 20 to 30 kW DC power systems. We do not have any long-term contracts or commitments with
any of these suppliers. If any of these engine suppliers were to fail to provide emissions certified engines in a timely manner or
fail to supply engines that meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements, or were to discontinue manufacturing any engines we
source from them or discontinue providing any of these engines to us, or the supply chain is interrupted or delayed as a result of a
pandemic or unprecedented event, and we were unable to obtain substitute sources in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us,
our ability to manufacture our products could be materially adversely affected. 

28 

Price
increases in some of the key components in our DC power systems could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash
flows. 

The
prices of some of the key components of our DC power systems are subject to fluctuation due to market forces beyond our control, including
changes in the costs of raw materials incorporated into these components. Such price increases occur from time to time due to spot shortages
of commodities, increases in labor costs or longer-term shortages due to market forces. In particular, the prices of engines can fluctuate
frequently and often significantly. We do not have any long-term contracts or commitments with our two key engine suppliers. Substantial
increases in the prices of raw materials used in components which we source from our suppliers may result in increased prices charged
by our suppliers. If we incur price increases from our suppliers for key components in our DC power systems, our production costs will
increase. Given competitive market conditions, we may not be able to pass all or any of those cost increases on to our customers in the
form of higher sales prices. To the extent our competitors do not suffer comparable component cost increases, we may have even greater
difficulty passing along price increases and our competitive position may be harmed. As a result, increases in costs of key components
may adversely affect our margins and otherwise adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. 

A
portion of our key components are sourced in foreign countries, exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the U.S. 

A
portion of our key components, such as engines, magnets and cooling systems, are purchased from suppliers located overseas, primarily
in Asia. Our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with third-party sourcing
generally. These risks include: 

inflation
 or changes in political and economic conditions; 

unstable
 regulatory environments; 

changes
 in import and export duties; 

currency
 rate fluctuations; 

trade
 restrictions; 

labor
 unrest; 

logistical
 and communications challenges; and 

other
 restraints and burdensome taxes. 

These
factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to source our purchased components overseas. In particular, if the U.S. dollar were
to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers, our cost of goods sold
could increase materially, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 

The
unavailability or shortage, or increase in the cost, of raw materials and components could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. 

Our
operations require raw materials, such as aluminum, copper and permanent magnets. Commodities such as aluminum and copper are known to
have significant price volatility based on global economic conditions. An increase in global economic outlook may result in significant
price increases in the cost of our raw materials. In addition, we use Neodymium permanent magnets in our alternators, for which there
are a limited number of global suppliers that can meet our standards. Increase in manufacturing of electric vehicles worldwide can have
an adverse effect on the cost or supply of these magnets. At our current production volumes, we are unable to secure large quantities
of these commodities at fixed prices; however, we do have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials to meet our near term forecasted
needs. Various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials and components and shortages may occur from time to time in the
future. An increase in lead times for the supply of raw materials due to a global increase in demand for commodities outlined may significantly
increase material costs of our products. If production was interrupted due to unavailability or shortage of raw materials and we were
not able to find alternate third-party suppliers or re-engineer our products to accommodate different components or materials, we could
experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs. If
our supply of raw materials or components is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition
could be materially adversely affected. 

29 

We
manufacture and assemble a majority of our products at two facilities. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of this facility would
result in a decline in our sales and profitability. 

We
manufacture and assemble our DC power systems at our two production facilities located in Gardena, California. Any prolonged disruption
in the operations of our manufacturing and assembly facilities, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery, equipment or information
technology infrastructure failure, labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to one or both of these facilities as a result of an
earthquake, fire, flood, other catastrophes, and other operational problems would result in a decline in our sales and profitability.
In the event of a business interruption at our facilities, we may be unable to shift manufacturing and assembly capabilities to alternate
locations, accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs, among other severe consequences. Such an event could have
a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations. 

Our
business operations are subject to substantial government regulation. 

Our
business operations are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, our products, services
and technologies are subject to regulations relating to building codes, public safety, electrical connections, security protocols, and
local and state licensing requirements. The regulations to which we are subject may change, additional regulations may be imposed, or
existing regulations may be applied in a manner that creates special requirements for the implementation and operation of our products
or services that may significantly impact or even eliminate some of our revenues or markets. In addition, we may incur material costs
or liabilities in complying with any such regulations. Furthermore, some of our customers must comply with numerous laws and regulations,
which may affect their willingness and ability to purchase our products, services and technologies. 

The
modification of existing laws and regulations or interpretations thereof or the adoption of future laws and regulations could adversely
affect our business, cause us to modify or alter our methods of operations and increase our costs and the price of our products, services
and technology. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able, for financial or other reasons, to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could become subject to substantial penalties
or restrictions that could materially and adversely affect our business. 

Certain
of our products are used in critical communications networks which may subject us to significant liability claims. 

Because
certain of our products for customers in the telecommunications industry are used in critical communications networks, we may be subject
to significant liability claims if our products do not work properly. We warrant to our customers that our products will operate in accordance
with our product specifications. If our products fail to conform to these specifications, our customers could require us to remedy the
failure or could assert claims for damages. The provisions in our agreements with customers that are intended to limit our exposure to
liability claims may not preclude all potential claims. In addition, any insurance policies we have may not adequately limit our exposure
with respect to such claims. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant
damages. Any such claims, whether or not successful, would be costly and time-consuming to defend, and could divert management s
attention and seriously damage our reputation and our business. 

We
could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. 

The
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit U.S.-based companies and
their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We may pursue
opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery
laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. Further, we
require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery
laws. Although we have policies and procedures, and have conducted training, designed to ensure that we, our employees, our agents and
others who work with us in foreign countries comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that such policies,
procedures or training will protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and
intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence
of others), we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on
our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged
FCPA violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. 

30 

We
are exposed to risks related to our international sales, and the failure to manage these risks could harm our business. If we fail to
expand our business into international markets, our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected . 

In
addition to our sales to customers within the U.S., we may become increasingly dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. as we
pursue expanding our business with customers worldwide. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our sales to international
customers accounted for 25 and 29 , respectively, of total revenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our sales
to international customers accounted for 20 and 28 , respectively, of total revenue. We continue to expect that a significant portion
of our future revenues will be from international sales to customers in less developed or developing countries. As a result, the occurrence
of any international, political, economic, or geographic event could result in a significant decline in revenue. There are significant
risks associated with conducting operations internationally, requiring significant financial commitments to support such operations.
These operations present a number of challenges including oversight of daily operating practices in each location, handling employee
benefits and employee behavior. In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international
operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations
include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA, and other
local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations, among others. 

Violations
of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions
on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially
affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results.
Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance
that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. 

Some
of the risks and challenges of doing business internationally include: 

the
 impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global markets and the power generation market with the international telecommunications markets; 

requirements
 or preferences for domestic products or solutions, which could reduce demand for our products; 

unexpected
 changes in regulatory requirements; 

imposition
 of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions; 

restrictions
 on the import or export of critical technology; 

management
 communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion; 

the
 burden of complying with a variety of laws and regulations in various countries; 

difficulties
 in enforcing contracts; 

the
 uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 

application
 of the income tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions, including relatively low-rate and relatively high-rate jurisdictions,
 to our sales and other transactions, which results in additional complexity and uncertainty; 

tariffs
 and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell products; 

greater
 risk of a failure of foreign employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including export and antitrust regulations, the
 FCPA and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices; 

heightened
 risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact
 financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements; 

potentially
 adverse tax consequences, including multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures; 

general
 economic and geopolitical conditions, including war and acts of terrorism; 

lack
 of the availability of qualified third-party financing; and 

currency
 exchange controls. 

While
these factors and the impacts of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations in the future. 

31 

Cyberattacks
through security vulnerabilities could lead to disruption of business, reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to
our reputation or competitive position. 

Security
vulnerabilities may arise from our hardware, software, employees, contractors or policies we have deployed, which may result in external
parties gaining access to our networks, data centers, cloud data centers, corporate computers, manufacturing systems, and/or access to
accounts we have at our suppliers, vendors, and customers. External parties may gain access to our data or our customers data
or attack the networks causing denial of service or attempt to hold our data or systems in ransom. The vulnerability could be caused
by inadequate account security practices such as failure to timely remove employee access when terminated. To mitigate these security
issues, we have implemented measures throughout our organization, including firewalls, backups, encryption, employee information technology
policies and user account policies. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be sufficient to avoid cyberattacks. If any
of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data, our relationships with our business partners
and customers could be materially damaged, our reputation could be materially harmed, and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation
and possible significant liability. 

Further,
if we fail to adequately maintain our information technology infrastructure, we may have outages and data loss. Excessive outages may
affect our ability to timely and efficiently deliver products to customers or develop new products. Such disruptions and data loss may
adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions
could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. 

The
State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, effective on January 1, 2020. Our and our business
partners or contractors failure to fully comply with the CCPA and other laws could lead to significant fines and require
onerous corrective action. In addition, data security breaches experienced by us or our business partners or contractors could result
in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive commercial data, and the exposure of personally
identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, customers, suppliers, contractors and others. 

Unauthorized
use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf, whether through breach of our systems,
breach of the systems of our suppliers or vendors by an unauthorized party, or through employee or contractor error, theft or misuse,
or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to
occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted, and we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and
investigations, related actions, and penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying
affected persons and entities and otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating
to the unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual unauthorized access to,
or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation, substantially impair our ability to attract and retain customers
and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks
Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If
we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose important proprietary technology, which could materially
and adversely affect our business. 

Our
success and ability to compete depends, in substantial part, upon our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual
property rights to distinguish our products, services and technology from those of our competitors. The unauthorized use of our intellectual
property rights and proprietary technology by others could materially harm our business. 

Historically,
we have relied primarily on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, along with non-competition and confidentiality
agreements, contractual provisions, licensing arrangements and proprietary software and manufacturing processes, to establish and protect
our intellectual property rights. Although we hold several unregistered copyrights in our business, we believe that the success of our
business depends more upon our proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how than on patents or trademark registrations.
In addition, much of our proprietary information and technology may not be patentable; if we decided to apply for patents and/or trademarks
in the future, we might not be successful in obtaining any such future patents or in registering any marks. 

Despite
our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, existing laws afford only limited protection, and our actions may be inadequate
to protect our rights or to prevent others from claiming violations of their proprietary rights. Unauthorized third parties may attempt
to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain, use or exploit aspects of our products and services, develop similar technology independently,
or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not independently
develop technology similar or superior to our technology or design around our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign
countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or in the same manner as the laws of the U.S. 

32 

We
may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity
and scope of other companies proprietary rights in the future. However, litigation could result in significant costs and in the
diversion of management and financial resources. We cannot assure you that any such litigation will be successful or that we will prevail
over counterclaims against us. Our failure to protect any of our important intellectual property rights or any litigation that we resort
to in order to enforce those rights could materially and adversely affect our business. 

If
we face claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties, we could encounter expensive litigation, be liable for significant
damages or incur restrictions on our ability to sell our products and services. 

Although
we are not aware of any present infringement of our products, services or technology on the intellectual property rights of others, we
cannot be certain that our products, services and technologies do not or in the future will not infringe on the valid intellectual property
rights held by third parties. In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that we have infringed their intellectual
property rights. 

In
recent years, there has been a significant amount of litigation in the U.S. involving patents and other intellectual property rights.
In the future, we may be a party to litigation as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property. Successful
infringement claims against us could result in substantial monetary liability, require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements,
or otherwise materially disrupt the conduct of our business. In addition, even if we prevail on these claims, this litigation could be
time-consuming and expensive to defend or settle and could result in the diversion of our time and attention and of operational resources,
which could materially and adversely affect our business. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one
or more of the following: 

stop
 selling, incorporating or using our products and services that use the infringed intellectual property; 

obtain
 from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not
 be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; or 

redesign
 the products and services that use the technology. 

If
we are forced to take any of these actions, our business may be seriously harmed. Although we carry general liability insurance, our
insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock 

Our
operating results can fluctuate significantly from period to period, which makes our operating results difficult to predict and can cause
our operating results in any particular period to be less than comparable periods and expectations from time to time. 

Our
operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter-to-quarter, period-to-period and year-to-year during our operating history
and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Certain
factors that may affect our operating results include, without limitation, those set forth under Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q. 

Because
we have little or no control over many of these factors, our operating results are difficult to predict. Any adverse change in any of
these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 

33 

Our
revenues, net income and other operating results are heavily dependent upon the size and timing of customer orders and projects, and
the timing of the completion of those projects. The timing of our receipt of large individual orders, and of project completion, is difficult
for us to predict. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues over the mid- and long-term and because a high percentage
of our operating expenses are relatively fixed, a shortfall or delay in recognizing revenues can cause our operating results to vary
significantly from quarter-to-quarter and can result in significant operating losses or declines in profit margins in any particular
quarter. If our revenues fall below our expectations in any particular quarter, we may not be able, or it may not be prudent for us,
to reduce our expenses rapidly in response to the revenue shortfall, which can result in us suffering significant operating losses or
declines in profit margins in that quarter. 

Due
to these factors and the other risks discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter, period-to-period
or year-to-year comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Quarterly, period and annual comparisons
of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance. As a result, it is likely that, from time
to time, our results of operations or our revenue backlog could fall below historical levels or the expectations of public market analysts
and investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly. 

Our
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer owns a significant percentage of our common stock and will exercise significant influence
over matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of the wishes of other stockholders. 

Our
Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, Arthur D. Sams, beneficially owns approximately 32 of our outstanding shares
of common stock. Mr. Sams therefore has significant influence over management and significant control over matters requiring stockholder
approval, including the annual election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company
or our assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control may limit stockholders ability to influence corporate matters
and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our common stock
could be adversely affected. 

The
price of our shares of common stock is volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

The
trading price of our shares of common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some
of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in the Risk Factors 
section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, these factors include, without limitation: 

competition
 from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge; 

the
 loss of significant customers, including AT T and Verizon Wireless; 

actual
 or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; 

34 

failure
 to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; 

our
 cash position; 

announcement
 or expectation of additional financing efforts; 

issuances
 of debt or equity securities; 

our
 inability to successfully enter new markets or develop additional products; 

actual
 or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors operating results or changes in their respective growth rates; 

sales
 of our shares of common stock by us, or our stockholders in the future; 

trading
 volume of our shares of common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; 

market
 conditions in our industry; 

overall
 performance of the equity markets and general political and economic conditions; 

introduction
 of new products or services by us or our competitors; 

additions
 or departures of key management, engineering or other personnel; 

publication
 of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities
 or industry analysts; 

changes
 in the market valuation of similar companies; 

disputes
 or other developments related to intellectual property and other proprietary rights; 

changes
 in accounting practices; 

significant
 lawsuits, including stockholder litigation; and 

other
 events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

Furthermore,
the public equity markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market
prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance
of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as
recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our shares of common
stock. 

A
decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, which could adversely impact our
ability to continue operations. 

A
prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in
our ability to raise capital. We may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations
through the sale of equity securities; thus, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our
operations because the decline may adversely affect investors desire to invest in our securities. If we are unable to raise the
funds we require for all of our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant
negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products or services and continue our current
operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and we may be forced to reduce or discontinue operations. We also might not be able
to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to reduce
or discontinue operations. 

We
do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment. 

We
have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain a significant portion of our future earnings, if
any, to finance the operations, development and growth of our business. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at
the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on number of factors, including our financial condition,
results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of
directors may deem relevant. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return
to stockholders. 

35 

Our
failure to satisfy certain listing requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which may
make it more difficult for our shareholders to sell shares of our common stock. 

Our
common stock is listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has several quantitative and qualitative requirements companies must comply with to maintain
this listing, including a 1.00 minimum bid price per share (the Bid Price Rule ). On November 24, 2023, we received a deficiency
letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq indicating that our common stock
is subject to potential delisting from the Nasdaq because for a period of 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock
has closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid
Price Rule ). The Nasdaq deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock continues
to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol POLA at this time. 

The
Nasdaq notice indicated that, in accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we will be provided 180 calendar days, or until
May 22, 2024, to regain compliance. On May 17, 2024, we submitted a request for an extension of time to meet compliance, and on May 30,
204, we received a Nasdaq extension letter granting us until November 18, 2024 to meet compliance. 

If,
at any time before November 18, 2024, the bid price of our common stock closes at 1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive
business days, Nasdaq staff will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with the Bid Price Rule. 

If
we do not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by November 18, 2024, our common stock will become subject to delisting. In the event
that we receive notice that our common stock is being delisted, the Nasdaq listing rules permit us to appeal a delisting determination
by Nasdaq to a hearings panel. 

On November 11, 2024, we held our annual meeting of stockholders. At the
meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, in substantially the form attached to the proxy statement
as Appendix A to allow the Board of Directors to effect, in its discretion prior to December 31, 2024, a reverse stock split of all of
our issued and outstanding common stock, par value 0.0001 per share, at a specific ratio, ranging from one-for-three (1:3) to one-for-twenty
(1:20), with the timing and ratio to be determined by the Board if effected. On November 11, 2024, our Board approved a reverse stock
split at a ratio of one-for-seven (1:7) (the Reverse Stock Split ). We plan to effect the Reverse Stock Split with the market
effective date of November 19, 2024. 

As we expect the bid price of our common stock will not close at 1.00
per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days before November 18, 2024, we expect to receive notice from Nasdaq that
our common stock is being delisted. We plan to appeal any delisting determination by Nasdaq to a hearings panel. 

On
December 18, 2023, Peter Gross, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of
the Company. Mr. Gross, an independent director, served as a member of the audit committee, chair of the compensation committee and chair
of the nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board at the time of his resignation. On January 5, 2024, the Company received
a notification letter from Nasdaq that due to Mr. Gross resignation, the Company is no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5605. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(4), the Company is entitled to a cure period to regain compliance (i) until the earlier
of the Company s next annual shareholders meeting or December 18, 2024; or (ii) if the next annual shareholders meeting
is held before June 17, 2024, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than June 17, 2024. 

Effective
July 25, 2024, we appointed Michael Field as a new member of the Board of Directors of the Company and appointed him, as an independent
director, to serve as a member of the audit committee, chair of the compensation committee and chair of the nominating and corporate
governance committee of the Board. By admitting Michael Field to the Board of Directors, we are back in compliance with Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5605 effective July 25, 2024. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5605 or other Nasdaq listing rules. 

If
the stock is delisted, we may trade on the over-the-counter market, or even in the pink sheets, which would significantly decrease the
liquidity of an investment in our common stock. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or reports about our
business, our share price and trading volume could decline. 

The
trading market for our shares of common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish
about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If no securities or industry analysts undertake coverage of
our company, the trading price for our shares of common stock may be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst
coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our shares of common stock, changes their opinion of our shares
or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts
ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares of common stock could decrease and we could
lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price and trading volume to decline. 

36 

We
are not subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could negatively affect your investment. 

We
elected in our certificate of incorporation to not be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
or Section 203. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination 
with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became
an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes
a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder 
is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, in certain cases, within three years prior, did own) 15 or more
of the corporation s voting stock. Our decision not to be subject to Section 203 will allow, for example, Arthur D. Sams, our Chairman,
President, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary (who beneficially owns approximately 32.0 of our common stock) to transfer shares in
excess of 15 of our voting stock to a third-party free of the restrictions imposed by Section 203. This may make us more vulnerable
to takeovers that are completed without the approval of our board of directors and/or without giving us the ability to prohibit or delay
such takeovers as effectively. 

Some
provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others,
even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our
current management. 

Provisions
in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party
to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include: 

a
 requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the board of directors, the president or the chief executive
 officer; 

advance
 notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors; and 

the
 authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval
 and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. 

These
anti-takeover provisions and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for stockholders
or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of
directors and could also delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our Company. These provisions could also discourage
proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing or cause us to take other
corporate actions you desire. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause
the market price of our common stock to decline. 

37 

Our
certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types
of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable
judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. 

Our
certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii)
any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders,
(iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation
or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 

For
the avoidance of doubt, the exclusive forum provision described above does not apply to any claims arising under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or
liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent
jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the
rules and regulations thereunder. 

The
choice of forum provision in our bylaws may limit our stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find
favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our
directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. The applicable courts
may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may
be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders.
With respect to the provision making the Delaware Court of Chancery the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions, stockholders
who do bring a claim in the Delaware Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly
if they do not reside in or near Delaware. Finally, if a court were to find this provision of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable
in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving
such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 

If
we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial
results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm
our business and the trading price of our common stock. 

Effective
internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure
controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered
in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal
deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective
or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls
could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading
price of our common stock. 

38 

We
are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to
assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are a non-accelerated filer under SEC rules,
our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that
our management s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement
restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. 

We
incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management expects to devote substantial time to public
company compliance programs. 

As
a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations
applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as well as rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. The SEC and other
regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance.
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant
corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional
rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government
intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance
costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel
devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations and, as a result
of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations, and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act
and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to
comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance
costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. 

To
comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various activities, including implementing new internal
controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information
required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial
officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate and weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting may be discovered in the future. 

Any
failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent
registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which
we may be required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, harm our
operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements.
In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting
is perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in
our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements,
we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

We
are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and are therefore not yet
required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. However,
we are required to comply with certain of these rules, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly
and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing
with our next annual report. This assessment will need to include the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. We are just beginning the costly
and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation needed to comply with such requirements. We may not be able
to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we
identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal
control over financial reporting is effective.

Raising
additional capital, including through future sales and issuances of our common stock, the exercise of warrants or the exercise of rights
to purchase common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plan could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our
stockholders, could cause our share price to fall and could restrict our operations. 

We
expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including any potential acquisitions,
purchasing of capital equipment, hiring new personnel, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we seek
additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings and debt financings, our stockholders may experience
substantial dilution. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership
interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect
the rights of our stockholders. Debt and receivables financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase
shares of our common stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness
would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our
ability to incur additional debt and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. A
failure to obtain adequate funds may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including sales and marketing, in order to reduce
costs and sustain the business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Under
our 2016 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or 2016 Plan, we may grant equity awards covering up to 1,754,385 shares of our common
stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had granted options to purchase an aggregate of 140,000 shares of common stock and issued 161,347
shares of common stock as stock-based compensation to officers, employees and consultants under the 2016 Plan. We have registered 1,754,385
shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2016 Plan. Sales of shares issued upon exercise of options or granted under our
2016 Plan may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, which could cause our share price to fall. 

Our
issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock, dilute the voting power of common
stockholders and delay or prevent a change of control. 

Our
board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 5,000,000 shares
of preferred stock in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices
and liquidation preferences of such series. 

The
issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to
the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock
less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price
of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase common
stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock. 

Further,
the issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes
of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or
by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action
were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may also have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders
are offered a premium for their shares.
