, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. BofA ), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and certain other parties to amend and restate our revolving line of credit (the Line of Credit to improve the pricing, extend the maturity date, change the interest reference rate, eliminate certain financial covenants and conditions, and reset other financial covenants starting with the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Credit Facility matures on , and provides us with revolving loan commitments totaling million, which may be increased up to million, of which million may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. Availability under the Credit Facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit, which are used to support our self-insurance programs. On October 1, 2024, there were borrowings of million and letters of credit of million outstanding, leaving million available to borrow. Borrowings under the Line of Credit bear interest at an annual rate equal to either (a) the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate BSBY plus a percentage not to exceed (with a floor on BSBY of 0.00 ), or (b) a percentage not to exceed above a Base Rate equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1.00 , (ii) BofA s Prime Rate, (iii) the , and (iv) 1.00 , in either case depending on the level of lease and debt obligations of the Company as compared to EBITDA plus lease expenses. The weighted average interest rate during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023 was approximately and , respectively. Effective October 29, 2024, we amended our Credit Facility to replace the referenced interest rate from BSBY, which will no longer be reported effective in November 2024, to a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate Term SOFR ). See Note 11 for further information. On October 1, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. Pursuant to the Line of Credit, we are required to pay certain customary fees and expenses associated with maintenance and use of the Line of Credit, including letter of credit issuance fees, unused commitment fees and in terest, which are payable monthly. Interest expense and commitment fees under the Credit Facility were approximately million and million, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, respectively. We also capitalized approximately million and million of i nterest expense related to new restaurant construction during each of the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023 , respectively.

share for each share of common stock issuable upon exercise of options granted. All options granted under the Plan expire within years of their date of grant. Awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights are charged against the Plan share reserve on the basis of one share for each share granted. All other awards are charged against the 2024 Plan share reserve on the basis of shares for each share granted. The Plan also contains other limits on the terms of incentive grants such as the maximum number that can be granted to a team member during any fiscal year. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options, and we use the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of our performance-based RSUs, which include a market-based metric. Both models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend rates. The fair value of service-based and performance-based RSUs granted is equal to the fair value of our common stock at market close on the date of grant or the last trading day prior to the date of grant when grants take place on a day when the market is closed. The grant date fair value of each stock option, market-based and service-based RSU is expensed over the vesting period (e.g., one , three or five years) and the fair value of each performance-based RSU is expensed based on the estimated quantity that is expected to vest corresponding with management's current estimate of the level that the performance goal will be achieved.

The effective tax rate benefit for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, was different from the statutory tax rate primarily as a result of significant Federal Insurance Contributions Act FICA tax tip credits.

GENERAL 
 BJ s Restaurants is a leading casual dining restaurant brand differentiated by a high-quality, varied menu with compelling value, and a dining experience that offers our customers (referred to as guests best-in-class service, hospitality and enjoyment, in a high-energy, welcoming and approachable atmosphere. As of November 4, 2024, BJ's owns and operates 218 restaurants located in 31 states. 
 The first BJ s restaurant opened in 1978 in Orange County, California, and was a small sit-down pizzeria that featured Chicago style deep-dish pizza with a unique California twist. In 1996, we introduced our proprietary craft beers and expanded the BJ s concept to a full-service, high-energy casual dining restaurant when we opened our first large format restaurant with an on-site brewing operation in Brea, California. Today our restaurants feature a broad menu with approximately 100 menu items designed to offer something for everyone including: slow roasted entrees such as prime rib, EnLIGHTened Entrees such as our Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon, our original signature deep-dish pizza, and the world-famous Pizookie dessert. We also offer our award-winning BJ s craft beers, which are produced at four in-house brewing facilities, two standalone brewpubs and by independent third-party brewers using our proprietary recipes, alongside a full bar featuring innovative cocktails. 
 Our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales from our restaurants, including takeout, delivery and catering sales. Revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered. Amounts paid with a credit card are recorded in accounts and other receivables until payment is collected from the credit card processor. We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date, and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. Gift card sales are recorded as a liability and recognized as revenues upon redemption in our restaurants. A portion of our gift card sales are not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as gift card breakage. Estimated gift card breakage is recorded as revenue and recognized in proportion to our historical redemption pattern, unless there is a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to government authorities. 
 Our guest loyalty program enables participants to earn points for qualifying purchases that can be redeemed for food and beverages in the future. We allocate the transaction price between the goods delivered and the future goods that will be delivered, on a relative standalone selling price basis, and defer the revenues allocated to the points until such points are redeemed. 
 All of our restaurants are Company-owned. In calculating comparable restaurant sales, we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for 18 months. Guest traffic for our restaurants is estimated based on the number of guest checks. 
 Cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage costs, including the cost to produce and distribute our proprietary craft beer, soda and ciders. The components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate directly with sales volumes but also may be impacted by changes in commodity prices, a shift in sales mix to higher cost proteins or other higher cost items, or varying levels of promotional activities. 
 Labor and benefit costs include direct hourly and management wages, bonuses, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and stock-based compensation, and workers compensation expense that are directly related to restaurant level team members. 
 Occupancy and operating expenses include restaurant supplies, credit card fees, third-party delivery company commissions, marketing costs, fixed rent, percentage rent, common area maintenance charges, utilities, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs. 
 General and administrative expenses include costs for our corporate administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth. Components of this category include corporate management, field supervision and corporate hourly staff salaries and related team member benefits (including stock-based compensation expense and cash-based incentive compensation), travel and relocation costs, information systems, the cost to recruit and train new restaurant management team members, corporate rent, certain brand marketing-related expenses and legal and consulting fees. 
 Depreciation and amortization are composed primarily of depreciation of capital expenditures for restaurant and brewing equipment and leasehold improvements. 
 Restaurant opening expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial hourly work force for each new restaurant, travel, the cost of food and supplies used in training, grand opening promotional costs, the cost of the initial stock of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant, including rent during the construction and in-restaurant training period.

Thirteen Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 3, 2023 
 Revenues . Total revenues increased by 7.1 million, or 2.2 , to 325.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 318.6 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. The increase in revenues primarily consisted of a 1.7 , or 5.2 million, increase in comparable restaurant sales, and 5.4 million related to sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable restaurant sales base. This increase was offset by a 2.7 million decrease related to closed restaurants and 0.7 million primarily related to gift card breakage and loyalty redemptions. The increase in comparable restaurant sales was due to an increase in guest traffic of approximately 1.3 , coupled with an increase in average check of approximately 0.4 , resulting from menu price increases, changes in mix and a higher level of promotions. 
 Cost of Sales. Cost of sales increased by 4.0 million, or 4.9 , to 86.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 82.7 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to higher commodity costs related to poultry and avocados. As a percentage of revenues, cost of sales increased to 26.6 for the current thirteen-week period from 25.9 for the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs and a higher level of promotions, partially offset by menu price increases. 
 Labor and Benefits. Labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by 2.5 million, or 2.1 , to 120.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 118.2 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to 1.5 million related to higher management compensation, 0.9 million related to higher hourly labor, 0.8 million in taxes and benefits, and 0.1 million in higher stock-based compensation expense, offset by 0.9 million related to lower workers compensation costs. As a percentage of revenues, labor and benefit costs remained consistent at 37.1 for the current thirteen-week period and the prior year comparable period. Included in labor and benefits for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, was approximately 0.7 million and 0.6 million, respectively, or 0.2 , of revenues of stock-based compensation expense, related to equity awards granted in accordance with our Gold Standard Stock Ownership Program for certain restaurant management team members. 
 Occupancy and Operating. Occupancy and operating expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 0.4 , to 80.3 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 80.0 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to increases of 1.2 million in marketing-related expenses, offset by decreases of 0.9 million in restaurant facility expenses. As a percentage of revenues, occupancy and operating expenses decreased to 24.7 for the current thirteen-week period from 25.1 for 
 13 

the prior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily related to improved operational efficiency and the effectiveness of our cost savings initiatives, coupled with a higher revenue base. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by 1.5 million, or 7.6 , to 21.0 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 19.5 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to increases of 1.7 million in personnel related costs, 0.8 million related to our deferred compensation liability, 0.4 million in legal fees, 0.3 million in office expenses, and 0.3 million in recruiting related expenses , offset by lower stock-based compensation of 1.9 million, and incentive compensation of 0.4 million. General and administrative expenses during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 included a net charge of 1.7 million related to our leadership transition and severance, relocation and signing bonus expenses, offset by a 2.1 million stock-based compensation credit related to the reversal of previously awarded stock-based compensation expense in conjunction with our leadership transition. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.4 for the current thirteen-week period from 6.1 for the prior year comparable period. This increase is primarily related to increased deferred compensation liability and personnel costs, coupled with legal and recruiting fees, offset by lower stock-based compensation expense related to our leadership transition. Included in general and administrative costs was stock-based compensation expense of approximately 0.2 million and 2.1 million, or 0.1 and 0.7 of revenues for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, respectively. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by 0.3 million, or 1.8 , to 18.2 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to 17.9 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily related to depreciation expense related to our restaurants opened since the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2023, coupled with depreciation related to our remodeled restaurants, partially offset by the impact of impairment and disposal charges taken in the prior year, and the closure of two restaurants since the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization remained consistent at 5.6 for the current thirteen-week period and the prior year comparable period. 
 Restaurant Opening . Restaurant opening expense decreased by 0.3 million, or 19.1 , to 1.1 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to 1.4 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of openings. 
 Loss on Disposal and Impairment of Assets, Net. Loss on disposal and impairment of assets, net, was 0.3 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, and 1.4 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. For the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, the costs primarily related to disposals of assets in conjunction with initiatives to keep our restaurants up to date. For the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2023, the costs primarily related to disposals of assets in conjunction with initiatives to keep our restaurants up to date as well as the closure of an under-performing restaurant in the quarter. 
 Interest Expense, Net . Interest expense, net, increased by 0.3 million to 1.3 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to 1.0 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in weighted average interest rate year over year, coupled with a higher average outstanding debt balance. 
 Other Income, Net . Other income, net, increased to 0.8 million of income during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024. This increase was primarily related to gains associated with the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies under our deferred compensation plan. 
 Income Tax Benefit. Our effective income tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, was a benefit of 8.2 compared to an expense of 11.8 for the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023 was different than the statutory rate primarily due to FICA tax tip credits. 
 
 Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Thirty-Nine-Weeks Ended October 3, 2023 
 Revenues . Total revenues increased by 3.4 million, or 0.3 , to 1.0 billion during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024. The increase in revenues primarily consisted of an 18.5 million increase related to sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable restaurant sales base, offset by a 0.2 , or 2.4 million, decline in comparable restaurant sales, an 11.2 million decrease related to closed restaurants, and 1.5 million primarily related to gift card breakage and loyalty redemptions. The decrease in comparable restaurant sales was due to a decrease in guest traffic of approximately 2.5 , offset by an increase in average check of approximately 2.3 , resulting from menu price increases and changes in mix. 
 Cost of Sales. Cost of sales decreased by 2.7 million, or 1.0 , to 261.5 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 264.1 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to the effects of our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity costs and a higher level of promotions. As a percentage of revenues, cost of sales decreased to 25.8 for the current thirty-nine-week period from 26.2 for the prior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily due to a higher revenue base, menu price increases and the effectiveness of our cost savings initiative, partially offset by higher commodity costs and a higher level of promotions. 
 14 

Labor and Benefits. Labor and benefit costs for our restaurants decreased by 1.0 million, or 0.3 , to 372.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 373.1 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to 2.3 million related to lower hourly labor and 1.5 million related to lower workers compensation, offset by 2.1 million related to increased management compensation costs and 0.7 million related to taxes and benefits. As a percentage of revenues, labor and benefit costs decreased to 36.7 for the current thirty-nine-week period from 37.0 for the prior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily due to improved labor efficiency and the effectiveness of our cost savings initiatives. Included in labor and benefits for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, was approximately 1.8 million and 1.9 million, respectively, or 0.2 of revenues of stock-based compensation expense, related to equity awards granted in accordance with our Gold Standard Stock Ownership Program for certain restaurant management team members. 
 Occupancy and Operating. Occupancy and operating expenses decreased by 4.3 million, or 1.8 , to 236.7 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 241.1 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to decreases of 4.1 million in restaurant facilities expenses, 1.0 million related to equipment rental, 0.9 million in utilities, and 0.3 million in delivery-related fees and expenses, offset by a 1.0 million increase in credit card processing fees and 1.3 million in marketing expenditures. As a percentage of revenues, occupancy and operating expenses decreased to 23.4 for the current thirty-nine-week period from 23.9 for the prior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily related to improved operational efficiency and the effectiveness of our cost savings initiatives. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by 4.2 million, or 6.9 , to 64.6 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, from 60.4 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to increases of 2.1 million in legal fees, 1.9 million in personnel related costs, 1.1 million in corporate expenses related to meeting costs and software amortization, 0.9 million related to our deferred compensation liability, 0.2 million in travel related expenses, and 0.2 million related to recruiting, offset by lower stock-based compensation expense of 1.8 million, and a 0.8 million decrease in incentive compensation. General and administrative costs for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 included a net charge of 1.7 million related to our leadership transition and severance, relocation and signing bonus expenses, 1.5 million of legal costs related to shareholder cooperation agreements and related matters, and 0.3 million in severance related to personnel changes, offset by a 2.1 million stock-based compensation credit related to the reversal of previously awarded stock-based compensation expense in conjunction with our leadership transition. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.4 for the current thirty-nine-week period from 6.0 for the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily related to increased legal and corporate expenses arising in connection with our previously announced cooperation agreements and related matters with certain investors. Included in general and administrative costs was stock-based compensation expense of approximately 4.4 million and 6.2 million, or 0.4 and 0.6 of revenues for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, respectively. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by 1.0 million, or 1.9 , to 54.2 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to 53.2 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily related to depreciation expense related to our restaurants opened since the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023, partially offset by the impact of impairment and disposal charges taken in the prior year, and the closure of two restaurants since the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization increased to 5.4 for the current thirty-nine-week period from 5.3 for the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily due to increased depreciation expense. 
 Restaurant Opening . Restaurant opening expense decreased by 0.6 million, or 22.9 , to 2.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to 2.6 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of openings. 
 Loss on Disposal and Impairment of Assets, Net. Loss on disposal and impairment of assets, net, was 3.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, and 4.7 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, the cost primarily related to the impairment and reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets related to one of our restaurants, coupled with the disposals of assets in conjunction with initiatives to keep our restaurants up to date. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023, these costs primarily relate to disposals of assets in conjunction with initiatives to keep our restaurants up to date, including our restaurant remodel initiative and the removal of glass partitions in our dining rooms that were installed during the pandemic, as well as the closure of four under-performing restaurants. 
 Interest Expense, Net . Interest expense, net, increased by 0.8 million to 4.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to 3.2 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in weighted average interest rate year over year, coupled with a higher average outstanding debt balance. 
 Other Income, Net . Other income, net, increased by 3.4 million to 4.2 million of income during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to 0.8 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily related to a payroll tax credit. 
 15 

Income Tax Benefit. Our effective income tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, was a benefit of 15.0 compared to a benefit of 44.9 for the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, was different than the statutory rate primarily due to FICA tax tip credits.

Current ratio 
 
 0.4:1.0 

0.4:1.0 

Our capital requirements are driven by our fundamental financial objective to improve total shareholder return through a balanced approach of new restaurant expansion plans, enhancements and initiatives focused on existing restaurants and return of capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. In addition, we want to maintain a flexible balance sheet to provide the financial resources necessary to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations in the restaurant industry. In order to achieve these objectives, we use a combination of operating cash flows, debt, landlord allowances and proceeds from stock option exercises. 
 Based on current operations, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, coupled with cash generated from operations and availability under our credit agreement will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future operating performance will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Similar to many restaurant chains, we typically utilize operating lease arrangements (principally ground leases) for our restaurant locations. We believe our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. However, we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants and from time to time have purchased the underlying land for new restaurants. We typically lease our restaurant locations for periods of 10 to 20 years under operating lease arrangements. Our rent structures vary from lease to lease, but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent (percentage) rent based on sales, as well as other expenses related to the leases (for example, our pro-rata share of common area maintenance, property tax and insurance expenses). Many of our lease arrangements include the opportunity to secure tenant improvement allowances to partially offset the cost of developing and opening the related restaurants. Generally, landlords recover the cost of such allowances from increased minimum rents. There can be no assurance that such allowances will be available to us on each project. From time to time, we may also decide to purchase the underlying land for a new restaurant if that is the only way to secure a highly desirable site. Currently, we own the underlying land for our Texas brewpub locations. We also own parcels of land adjacent to two of our restaurants. It is not our current strategy to own a large number of land parcels that underlie our restaurants. Therefore, in many cases we have subsequently entered into sale-leaseback arrangements for land parcels that we previously purchased. We disburse cash for certain site-related work, buildings, leasehold improvements, furnishings, fixtures and equipment to build our leased and owned premises. We own substantially all of the equipment, furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future. 
 CASH FLOWS

Operating Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 69.8 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, representing a 3.8 million decrease from the 73.6 million provided during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. The decrease over prior year is 
 16 

primarily due to the timing of accounts receivable receipts coupled with the timing of accounts payable and accrued expense payments, offset by improved net income. 
 Investing Cash Flows	 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 61.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, representing a 20.9 million decrease from the 82.0 million used during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. The decrease over prior year is primarily due to the number of new restaurant openings coupled with the timing of restaurant remodel activity.

81,968 

As of November 4, 2024, we have opened three new restaurants and closed one restaurant this year. We currently anticipate our total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be approximately 75 million. This estimate includes costs to open new restaurants and remodel existing locations and excludes anticipated proceeds from tenant improvement allowances. We expect to fund our net capital expenditures with our current cash balance on hand, cash flows from operations and our line of credit. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of our expansion, conditions in the retail property development market, construction costs, the nature of the specific sites selected for new restaurants, and the nature of the specific leases and associated tenant improvement allowances available, if any, as negotiated with landlords. 
 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 19.5 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, representing a 14.9 million increase from the 4.6 million used during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. The increase over prior year is primarily due to an increase in shares repurchased. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities VIEs ), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes. As of October 1, 2024, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 IMPACT OF INFLATION 
 Inflation has had an impact on our operations, new restaurant construction and corresponding return on invested capital. While we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating inputs by gradually increasing menu prices, coupled with cost savings initiatives, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. Increases in inflation could have a severe impact on the United States and global economies, which will have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make additional menu price increases imprudent. Whether we are able to continue to offset the effects of inflation through menu price increases or cost savings will determine to what extent, if any, inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods. 
 SEASONALITY AND ADVERSE WEATHER 
 Our business is impacted by weather and other seasonal factors that typically impact other restaurant operations. Holidays (and shifts in the holiday calendar) and severe weather including hurricanes, tornados, thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, prolonged extreme temperatures and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes in some of the markets where we operate. Many of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales. Quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening expenses. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. We continually review the estimates and underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 
 A summary of our other critical accounting policies is included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies. 
 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The following discussion of market risks contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have a 215 million Credit Facility, of which 66.5 million is currently outstanding and carries interest at a floating rate. We utilize the Credit Facility principally for letters of credit that are required to support our self-insurance programs, to fund a portion of our announced share repurchase program, and for working capital and construction requirements, as needed. We are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations in interest rates on our obligations under the Credit Facility. Based on our current outstanding balance, a hypothetical 1 change in the interest rates under our Credit Facility would have an approximate 0.5 million annual impact on our net income. 
 Food, Supplies and Commodity Price Risks 
 We purchase food, supplies and other commodities for use in our operations based upon market prices established with our suppliers. Our business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of these items. We may experience shortages, delays or interruptions due to inclement weather, natural disasters, labor issues or other operational disruptions or other conditions beyond our control such as cyber breaches or ransomware attacks at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers. Additionally, many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control, whether contracted for or not. Costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. To manage this risk in part, we attempt to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments, with terms typically up to one year, for some of our commodity requirements. However, it may not be possible for us to enter into fixed-price contracts for certain commodities or we may choose not to enter into fixed-price contracts for certain commodities. We believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources, which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk. We also believe that we have some flexibility and ability to increase certain menu prices, or vary certain menu items offered or promoted, in response to food commodity price increases. Some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps. We do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices, since our purchase arrangements with suppliers, to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements, help control the ultimate cost that we pay. 
 Item 4. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of October 1, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our third fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUI TY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 As of October 1, 2024, we have cumulatively repurchased shares valued at approximately 506.0 million in accordance with our approved share repurchase plan since its inception in 2014. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, we repurchased and retired shares valued at approximately 17.1 million. Share repurchases were executed through open market purchases, and future share repurchases may be completed through a combination of individually negotiated transactions, accelerated share buyback, and/or open market purchases. In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase program by 50 million. As a result, we had approximately 44.0 million available under our authorized 550 million share repurchase program as of October 1, 2024.

Unless such L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices.

If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, such L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, Unreimbursed Amount, and the amount of such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. 

In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the affected L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the affected L/C Issuer. 

(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the affected L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the affected L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03 . 

(iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the affected L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the affected L/C Issuer. 

(v) Each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) as to L/C Advances, the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however , that each Lender s obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to 

33 151056736_7 

reimburse an L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 

(vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii) , then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by such L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in the relevant Committed Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of an L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d) Repayment of Participations . 

(i) At any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c) , if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 

(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 

(e) Obligations Absolute . The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse an L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 

(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), such L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the 

34 151056736_7 

transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 

(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 

(iv) waiver by such L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuer s protection and not the protection of the Borrower or any waiver by such L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower; 

(v) honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft; 

(vi) any payment made by such L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC or the ISP, as applicable; 

(vii) any payment by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or 

(viii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 

The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the applicable L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against such L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
 (f) Role of L/C Issuer . Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of any L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided , however , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of any L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor 

35 151056736_7 

any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 2.03(e) ; provided , however , that anything in such Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against an L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such L/C Issuer s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C Issuer s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, an L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. An L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication SWIFT message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 

(g) Applicability of ISP; Limitation of Liability . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and such L/C Issuer s rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of such L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. 

(h) Letter of Credit Fees . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance, subject to Section 2.16 , with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the Letter of Credit Fee for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06 . Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate. 

(i) Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer . The Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. Any such customary fees and standard costs and charges not paid by the Borrower shall be reimbursed by the Lenders in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of such customary fees and standard costs and charges. 

36 151056736_7 

(j) Conflict with Issuer Documents . In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.

(ii) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer; and 

(iii) for so long as any Letter of Credit issued by an L/C Issuer is outstanding, such L/C Issuer shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (A) on the last Business Day of each calendar month, (B) at all other times a Letter of Credit Report is required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and (C) on each date that (1) an L/C Credit Extension occurs or (2) there is any expiration, cancellation and/or disbursement, in each case, with respect to any such Letter of Credit, a Letter of Credit Report appropriately completed with the information for every outstanding Letter of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer. 

(l) Removal of L/C Issuer . If a Person serving as an L/C Issuer is a Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the other L/C Issuers and such Person remove such Person as an L/C Issuer, and the Borrower (with the prior consent of the Administrative Agent) may replace such L/C Issuer with any Lender who is not a Defaulting Lender provided that no Lender shall be required to become an L/C Issuer pursuant to this Paragraph without such Lender s consent). If no such successor shall have been so selected and shall have accepted such selections within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the L/C Issuer Removal Effective Date ), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the L/C Issuer Removal Effective Date. 

(m) Replacement of Any L/C Issuer . Any L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an L/C Issuer. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(h) . From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor L/C Issuer shall have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term L/C Issuer shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous L/C Issuer, or such successor and all previous L/C Issuer, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an L/C Issuer hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of any Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with, in the case of any Term SOFR Loan, any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05 . Subject to Section 2.16 , each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. 

(b) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided , however , that the Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(B) unless after the prepayment in full of the Committed Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.

(b) (i) 	If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

(iii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists (other than as set forth in clauses (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above), the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a) , bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 

(b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Pricing Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the definition of Applicable Rate as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Pricing Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii) , 2.03(h) or 2.08(b) or under Article VIII . The Borrower s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 

2.11 Evidence of Debt . 

(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender in the ordinary course of business. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register in accordance with Section 10.06(c) . The accounts or records maintained by each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 

40 151056736_7 

(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) above, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 

2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent s Clawback . 

(a) General . All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 

(b) (i) 	 Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 

(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume

that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. 

With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or an L/C Issuer hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the Rescindable Amount ): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 

(d) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c) . 

(e) Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 

2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: 

42 151056736_7 

(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 

(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.15 , or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D) , FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 

(iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 

(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . Unless required by Applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or any L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 

(g) Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or 

51 151056736_7 

an L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 

(h) Defined Terms . For purposes of this Section 3.01 , the term Applicable Law includes FATCA. 

3.02 Illegality . If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05 . 

3.03 Inability to Determine Rates . 

(a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion of Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or a continuation of any of such Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b) , and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that, for any reason, Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of this Section 3.03(a) , until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, or conversion to, or 

52 151056736_7 

continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period. 

(b) Replacement of Term SOFR or Successor Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that: 

(a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR, including, without limitation, because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or 

(b) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such representative interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date ); 

then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate ). 
 If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis. 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any 
 53 151056736_7 

evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
 The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 For purposes of this Section 3.03 , those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders. 
 3.04 Increased Costs . 

(a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 

(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender or any L/C Issuer; 

(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 

(iii) impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Term SOFR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount 
 54 151056736_7 

of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Administrative Agent will concurrently therewith deliver to the Borrower documentary evidence on which the Lender s determination and such certificate are based. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or such L/C Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 

3.05 Compensation for Losses . Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 

(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 

(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or 

55 151056736_7 

(c) any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13 ; 

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 
 3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . 

(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to the Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 , or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01 , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , then at the request of the Borrower such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or any L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment. 

(b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a) , the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13 . 

3.07 Survival . All of the Borrower s obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. 
 (c) Register . The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ).

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 , 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04 , with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
 94 151056736_7

In the event of any such resignation as an L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided , however , that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of such Lender as an L/C Issuer. If any Lender resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c) ).
