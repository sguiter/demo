million of loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture. Of this amount, million was concentrated in corn and other grain farming. Total loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture increased million from million at December 31, 2023 due to seasonal timing of cash flow requirements. Loans concentrated in corn and other grain farming increased million from million at December 31, 2023. The Company's underwriting practices include collateralization of loans. Any extended period of low commodity prices, drought conditions, significantly reduced yields on crops and/or reduced levels of government assistance to the agricultural industry could result in an increase in the level of problem agriculture loans and potentially result in loan losses within the agricultural portfolio. In addition, the Company has million of loans to motels and hotels. The performance of these loans is dependent on borrower specific issues as well as the general level of business and personal travel within the region. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting standards, a prolonged period of reduced business or personal travel could result in an increase in nonperforming loans to this business segment and potentially in loan losses. The Company also has billion of loans to lessors of non-residential buildings, and million of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings. The structure of the Company s loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to individual loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the board of directors. Outstanding balances to one borrower or affiliated borrowers are limited by federal regulation and most borrowers are below regulatory thresholds. The Company can occasionally have outstanding balances to one borrower up to but not exceeding the regulatory threshold should underwriting guidelines warrant. Most of the Company s loans are to businesses located in the geographic market areas served by the Company s branch bank system. Additionally, a significant portion of the collateral securing the loans in the portfolio is located within the Company s primary geographic footprint. In general, the Company adheres to loan underwriting standards consistent with industry guidelines for all loan segments. The Company s lending can be summarized into the following primary areas: Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans are generally comprised of loans to small business entities to purchase or expand structures in which the business operations are housed, loans to owners of real estate who lease space to non-related commercial entities, loans for construction and land development, loans to hotel operators, and loans to owners of multi-family residential structures, such as apartment buildings. Commercial real estate loans are underwritten based on historical and projected cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying real estate pledged as collateral on the debt. For the various types of commercial real estate loans, minimum criteria have been established within the Company s loan policy regarding debt service coverage while maximum limits on loan-to-value and amortization periods have been defined. Maximum loan-to-value ratios range from to depending upon the type of real estate collateral, while the desired minimum debt coverage ratio is . Amortization periods for commercial real estate loans are generally limited to or , depending on the loan-to-value. The Company s commercial real estate portfolio is below the thresholds that would designate a concentration in commercial real estate lending, as established by the federal banking regulators.

or less. Also, equipment financing is provided to businesses with these loans generally limited to of the value of the collateral and amortization periods limited to . Commercial loans are often accompanied by a personal guaranty of the principal owners of a business. Like commercial real estate loans, the underlying cash flow of the business is the primary consideration in the underwriting process. The financial condition of commercial borrowers is monitored at least annually with the type of financial information required determined by the size of the relationship. Measures employed by the Company for businesses with higher risk profiles include the use of government- assisted lending programs through the Small Business Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture. Agricultural and Agricultural Real Estate Loans. Agricultural loans are generally comprised of seasonal operating lines to cash grain farmers to plant and harvest corn and soybeans and term loans to fund the purchase of equipment. Agricultural real estate loans are primarily comprised of loans for the purchase of farmland. Specific underwriting standards have been established for agricultural-related loans including the establishment of projections for each operating year based on industry developed estimates of farm input costs and expected commodity yields and prices. Operating lines are typically written for and secured by the crop. Loan-to-value ratios on loans secured by farmland generally do not exceed and have amortization periods limited to . Federal government-assistance lending programs through the Farm Service Agency are used to mitigate the level of credit risk when deemed appropriate. Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential real estate loans generally include loans for the purchase or refinance of residential real estate properties consisting of one-to-four units and home equity loans and lines of credit. The Company sells most of its long-term fixed rate residential real estate loans to secondary market investors. The Company also releases the servicing of these loans upon sale. Residential real estate loans are typically underwritten to conform to industry standards including criteria for maximum debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios as well as minimum credit scores. Loans secured by first liens on residential real estate held in the portfolio typically do not exceed of the value of the collateral and have amortization periods of or less. The Company does not originate subprime mortgage loans. Consumer Loans. Consumer loans are primarily comprised of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes such as the purchase of an automobile or other living expenses. Minimum underwriting criteria have been established that consider credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment history, and collateral coverage. Typically, consumer loans are set up on monthly payments with amortization periods based on the type and age of the collateral. Other Loans. Other loans consist primarily of loans to municipalities to support community projects such as infrastructure improvements or equipment purchases. Underwriting guidelines for these loans are consistent with those established for commercial loans with the additional repayment source of the taxing authority of the municipality. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents the Company s best estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the assets. The provision for credit losses is the charge against current earnings that is determined by the Company as the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and therefore the provision to be charged to current earnings, the Company relies predominantly on a disciplined credit review and approval process that extends to the full range of the Company s credit exposure. The review process is directed by the overall lending policy and is intended to identify, at the earliest possible stage, borrowers who might be facing financial difficulty. Factors considered by the Company in evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance include historical net loan losses, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and modified loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses by evaluating large individually evaluated loans separately from non-individually evaluated loans. Individually Evaluated Loans The Company individually evaluates certain loans for impairment. In general, these loans have been internally identified via the Company s loan grading system as credits requiring management s attention due to underlying problems in the borrower s business or collateral concerns. This evaluation considers expected future cash flows, the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to make payments when due. For loans greater than , impairment is individually measured each quarter using one of alternatives: (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (2) the loan s observable market price, if available; or (3) the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell for collateral dependent

Both adversely classified and past dues have been consistent. There was no change to the qualitative factors for this segment. HELOC Loans. These loans are a small segment to overall loan balances. In the period, past dues increased to a level that resulted in a significant increase to the qualitative factors for this segment. Commercial Real Estate Owner Occupied Loans. This segment has remained stable, despite macro segment concerns over commercial real estate. The Company has previously increased qualitative factors for those conditions, but believes the stability in the portfolio and improvement in the macro-economic environment warranted a moderate decrease in the factor for the period. Commercial Real Estate Non Owner Occupied Loans. This segment includes the Company's largest balances. While qualitative factors had been increased in past periods for the economic uncertainty in the macro conditions, the Company did not believe any additional changes were warranted other than minor decrease for falling below the internal concentration thresholds for factor adjustments. Agricultural Loans. Losses in this segment are very low. Commodity prices have remained depressed for an extended period but yields have experienced increases from previous concerns from the weather.

Consistent with regulatory guidance, charge-offs on all loan segments are taken when specific loans, or portions thereof, are considered uncollectible. The Company s policy is to promptly charge these loans off in the period the uncollectible loss is reasonably determined. For all loan portfolio segments except 1-4 family residential properties and consumer, the Company promptly charges-off loans, or portions thereof, when available information confirms that specific loans are uncollectible based on information that includes, but is not limited to, (1) the deteriorating financial condition of the borrower, (2) declining collateral values, and/or (3) legal action, including bankruptcy, that impairs the borrower s ability to adequately meet its obligations. For individually evaluated loans that are considered solely collateral dependent, a partial charge-off is recorded when a loss has been confirmed by an updated appraisal or other appropriate valuation of the collateral. The Company charges-off 1-4 family residential and consumer loans, or portions thereof, when the Company reasonably determines the amount of the loss. The Company adheres to time frames established by applicable regulatory guidance which provides for the charge-down of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages to the net realizable value less costs to sell when the loan is days past due, charge-off of unsecured open-end loans when the loan is days past due, and charge down to the net realizable value when other secured loans are days past due. Loans at these respective delinquency thresholds for which the Company can clearly document that the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection, such that collection will occur regardless of delinquency status, need not be charged off.

Credit Quality The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, collateral support, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on a continuous basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings which are commensurate with a loan considered criticized : Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound-worthiness and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing factors, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered pass rated loans.

Individually Evaluated Loans Within all loan portfolio segments, loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The entire balance of a loan is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the specified due date. Impaired loans, excluding certain modified, are placed on nonaccrual status. Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and loans modified in restructuring where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. It is the Company s policy to have any restructured loans which are on nonaccrual status prior to being modified remain on nonaccrual status until, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. If the restructured loan is on accrual status prior to being modified, the loan is reviewed to determine if the modified loan should remain on accrual status. The Company s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest income on all loans for which principal or interest is ninety days past due. The accrual of interest is discontinued earlier when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current year income. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Interest on loans determined to be modified is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the restructured terms if the loan is in compliance with the modified terms. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. The Company requires a period of satisfactory performance of not less than six months before returning a nonaccrual loan to accrual status. The amount of interest income recognized by the Company within the periods stated above was due to loans modified in restructuring that remain on accrual status.

The right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral pledged by the Company would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Company be in default (e.g., declare bankruptcy), the Company could cancel the repurchase agreement (i.e., cease payment of principal and interest), and attempt collection on the amount of collateral value in excess of the repurchase agreement fair value. The collateral is held by a third-party financial institution in the counterparty's custodial account. The counterparty has the right to sell or repledge the investment securities. For government entity repurchase agreements, the collateral is held by the Company in a segregated custodial account under a tri-party agreement. The Company is required by the counterparty to maintain adequate collateral levels. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, the Company will pledge additional securities. The Company closely monitors collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained, while mitigating the potential of over-collateralization in the event of counterparty default.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. Collateral Dependent Loans. Loans for which it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest due according to contractual terms are measured for impairment. Allowable methods for determining the amount of impairment and estimating fair value include using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans. If the impaired loan is identified as collateral dependent, then the fair value method of measuring the amount of impairment is utilized. This method requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor to the value, which includes selling costs. Individually evaluated loans that are collateral dependent are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy when impairment is determined using the fair value method. Management establishes a specific allowance for individually evaluated loans that have an estimated fair value that is below the carrying value. The total carrying amount of loans for which a change in specific allowance has occurred as of September 30, 2024 was and a fair value of resulting in specific loss exposures of . When there is little prospect of collecting principal or interest, loans, or portions of loans, may be charged-off to the allowance for credit losses. Losses are recognized in the period an obligation becomes uncollectible. The recognition of a loss does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off the loan even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. Foreclosed Assets Held For Sale. Other real estate owned acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. The adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for credit losses. Due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired, the actual fair value of the other real estate owned, or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate. If it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense. Operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense. Gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest expense. The total carrying amount of other real estate owned as of September 30, 2024 was million . Other real estate owned included in the total carrying amount and measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the period amounted to .

The Company recorded million of goodwill in connection with the acquisition of Blackhawk, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. The amount of goodwill recorded reflects the synergies and operational efficiencies that are expected to result from the acquisition. The descriptions below describe the methods used to determine the fair value of significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as presented above: Loans, net . The fair value of the loan portfolio was calculated on an individual loan basis using a discounted cash flow analysis, with results presented and assumptions applied on a summary basis. This analysis took into consideration the contractual terms of the loans and assumptions related to the cost of debt, cost of equity, servicing cost and other liquidity/risk premium considerations to estimate the projected cash flows. The inputs and assumptions used in the fair value estimate of the loan portfolio include credit mark, discount rate, prepayment speed, and foreclosure lag. Cash flows were adjusted by estimating future credit losses and the rate of prepayments. Projected monthly cash flows were then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted market rate for similar loans. Core deposit intangible. The Company identified customer relationships, in the form of core deposit intangibles, as an identified intangible asset. Core deposit intangibles derive value from the expected future benefits or earnings capacity attributable to the acquired core deposits. The fair value of the core deposit intangible was estimated by identifying the expected future benefits of the core deposits and discounting those benefits back to present value. The core deposit intangible will be amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately years using the sum of the months digits accelerated method.

to with various renewal options. The Company elected the optional transition method permitted by Topic 842. Under this method, the Company recognizes and measures leases that exist at the application date and prior comparative periods are not adjusted. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients: 1. An entity need not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases. 

 2. An entity need not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases. 

 3. An entity need not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. 

 The Company has also elected the practical expedient, which may be elected separately or in conjunction with the package noted above, to use hindsight in determining the lease term and in assessing the right-of-use assets. This expedient must be applied consistently to all leases. Lastly, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient to include both lease and non-lease components as a single component and account for it as a lease. In addition, the Company has elected to not include short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of twelve months or less) or equipment leases (primarily copiers) deemed immaterial, on the consolidated balance sheets. For leases in effect at January 1, 2019 and for leases commencing thereafter, the Company recognizes a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used in determining present value was the Company's incremental borrowing rate which is the FHLB fixed advance rate based on the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019, or the commencement date for leases subsequently entered into.

Certain of the Company's leases contain options to renew the lease; however, not all renewal options are included in the calculation of lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company's leases do not contain residual value guarantees or material variable lease payments. The Company does not have any other material restrictions or covenants imposed by leases that would impact the Company's ability to pay dividends or cause the Company to incur additional financial obligations.

 Overview 
 This overview of management s discussion and analysis highlights selected information in this document and may not contain all the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting estimates which have an impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations you should carefully read this entire document. 
 Net income was 59.7 million and 50.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Diluted net income per common share was 2.49 and 2.40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The following table shows the Company s annualized performance ratios for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,

Total assets were 7.6 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents increased 21.1 million, net loan balances increased 30.8 million and investment securities decreased 55.7 million. Net loan balances were 5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to 5.5 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets, was 3.32 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, up from 2.95 for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in earning asset yields partially offset by increased rates on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income before the provision for loan losses was 169.8 million compared to net interest income of 136.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank during the third quarter of 2023 and increased net interest margin as mentioned above. 
 Total non-interest income of 69.9 million increased 4.9 million or 7.5 from 65.0 million for the same period last year. The increase in non-interest income resulted primarily from an increase in insurance commissions, wealth management revenues, and income generated from former Blackhawk Bank customers partially offset by a decrease in bank owned life insurance income and a decrease in the gain or loss on securities. 
 Total non-interest expense of 158.7 million increased 30.0 million or 23.3 from 128.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank during the third quarter of 2023 and the related amortization of intangibles and increased size of the bank causing increased expenses. 
 Following is a summary of the factors that contributed to the changes in net income (in thousands):

Credit quality is an area of importance to the Company. Total nonperforming loans were 18.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 21.3 million at September 30, 2023 and 20.1 million at December 31, 2023. See the discussion under the heading Loan Quality and Allowance for Loan Losses for a detailed explanation of these balances. Repossessed asset balances totaled 1.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million at September 30, 2023 and 1.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
 The Company s provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.0 million and 5.6 million, respectively. Total loans past due 30 days or more were 0.39 of loans at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.23 at September 30, 2023, and 0.26 of loans at December 31, 2023. Loans secured by both commercial and residential real estate comprised approximately 68.8 of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and 68.9 as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Company s capital position remains strong, and the Company has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios above the well-capitalized standards. The Company s Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets ratio calculated under the regulatory risk-based capital requirements at September 30, 2024 and 2023 and December 31, 2023 was 12.70 , 10.19 and 12.02 , respectively. The Company s total capital to risk weighted assets ratio calculated under the regulatory risk-based capital requirements at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023 was 15.24 , 12.60 and 14.84 , respectively. The increase in Tier 1 capital and total to risk weighted assets ratio from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to net income less dividends declared for the period increasing equity and a decrease in risk weighted assets related to a reallocation of the Company's balance sheet resulting in lower risk weighted assets such as cash on hand increasing and investment securities decreasing.

On March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies, issued an interim final rule which provided an option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital of ASU 2016-13, which was effective January 1, 2020. The initial impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13, as well as 25 of the quarterly increases in the allowance for credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 ("CECL adjustments"), was be delayed for two years. The cumulative amount of these adjustments is being phased out of the regulatory capital calculation over a three-year period, with 75 of the adjustments included in 2022, 50 of the adjustments included in 2023 and 25 of the adjustments included in 2024. After five years, the temporary delay of ASU 2016-13 adoption will be fully reversed. The Company has elected this option. 
 The Company s liquidity position remains sufficient to fund operations and meet the requirements of borrowers, depositors, and creditors. The Company maintains various sources of liquidity to fund its cash needs. See the discussion under the heading Liquidity for a full listing of sources and anticipated significant contractual obligations. 
 The Company enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include lines of credit, letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit. The total outstanding commitments at September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1.4 billion and 1.1 billion, respectively. 
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Insurance Coverage. As FDIC-insured institutions, First Mid Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Several requirements with respect to the FDIC insurance system have affected results, including insurance assessment rates. 
 The Company expensed 2.6 million and 2.3 million for the assessment during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates 
 The Company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies of the Company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities; management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the Company. 
 Investment in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which was codified into ASC 320. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. Fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis, or through obtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. 
 If the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost, the Company evaluates whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If such an event or change has occurred and the Company determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, a further determination is made as to the portion of impairment that is related to credit loss. The impairment of the investment that is related to the credit loss is expensed in the period in which the event or change occurred. The remainder of the impairment is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). 
 Loans. Loans are reported at amortized cost. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase discounts and premiums, fair value hedge accounting adjustments and deferred loan fees and costs. Accrued interest is reported separately and is included in interest receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The Company believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses for loans represents the best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio are determined and an allowance for those losses is established by considering factors including historical loss rates, expected cash flows and estimated collateral values. In assessing these factors, the Company uses 
 42 

relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
 
 To determine the allowance, the loan portfolio is segmented based on similar risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses is estimated using a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology. The DCF projects future cash flows over the life of the loan portfolio. Probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) are key components in calculating expected losses in this model. The PD is forecasted using a regression model that determines the likelihood of default with a forward-looking forecast of unemployment rates. The LGD is the percentage of defaulted loans that is ultimately charged off. The allowance is calculated as the net present value of the expected cash flows less the amortized cost basis of the loans. Prior to 2022, the allowance for credit losses was measured on a collective (pool) basis for non-individually evaluated loans with similar risk characteristics. Historical credit loss experience provided the basis for the estimate of expected credit losses. Adjustments to expected losses are made using qualitative factors for relevant to each loan segment including merger acquisition activity, economic conditions, changes in policies, procedures underwriting, and concentrations. In addition, a forecast, using reasonable and supportable future conditions, is prepared that is used to estimate expected changes to existing and historical conditions in the current period. 
 
 The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for individually evaluated loans by evaluating them separately. A specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral are less than the carrying amount of the loan. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period that the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Other Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned acquired through loan foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. The adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for loan losses. Due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired, the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate. If it is determined that fair value temporarily declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through noninterest expense. 
 Operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense. Gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other noninterest expense. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights. The Company has elected to record mortgage servicing rights under the amortization method. Using this method, servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. The amortized assets are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. 
 Impairment is recognized through a valuation reserve, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount of the servicing assets. Fair value in excess of the carrying amount of servicing assets is not recognized. 
 Deferred Income Tax Assets/Liabilities. The Company s net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter our reported income and taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise. From an accounting standpoint, deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they are realizable based on the historical level of taxable income, estimates of future taxable income and the reversals of deferred tax liabilities. In most cases, the realization of the deferred tax asset is based on future profitability. If the Company were to experience net operating losses for tax purposes in a future period, the realization of deferred tax assets would be evaluated for a potential valuation reserve. 
 Additionally, the Company reviews its uncertain tax positions annually under FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN No. 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , codified within ASC 740. An uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be recognized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test, no tax benefit is recorded. A significant amount of judgment is applied to determine both whether the tax position meets the "more likely than not" test as well as to determine the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be recognized. Differences between the position taken by management and that of taxing authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or increase to tax liability, which could adversely affect future income tax expense. 
 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Core deposit and customer relationships, which are intangible assets with a finite life, are recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. These intangible assets were capitalized as a result of past acquisitions and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 15 years. Core deposit intangible assets, with finite 
 43 

lives will be tested for impairment when changes in events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Core deposit intangible assets were tested for impairment as of September 30, 2024 as part of the goodwill impairment test and no impairment was identified. 
 As a result of the Company s acquisition activity, goodwill, an intangible asset with an indefinite life, is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, unless there are factors present that indicate a potential impairment, in which case, the goodwill impairment test is performed more frequently than annually. 
 Fair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Company estimates the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Company estimates fair value. The Company s valuation methods consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded. 
 SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements , which was codified into ASC 820, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and establishes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the fair value measurement date. 
 The three levels are defined as follows: 
 Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

At the end of each quarter, the Company assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. Transfers into or out of hierarchy levels are based upon the fair value at the beginning of the reporting period. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy can be found in Note 7 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities. 
 Results of Consolidated Operations 
 Net Interest Income 
 The largest source of revenue for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between total interest income earned on earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors, including the volume and mix of earning assets, the general level of interest rates and the dynamics of changes in interest rates. The cost of funds necessary to support earning assets varies with the volume and mix of interest-bearing liabilities and the rates paid to attract and retain such funds. 
 Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical purposes, net interest income is presented on a full tax equivalent ("TE") basis in the table that follows. The federal statutory rate in effect of 21 for 2024 and 2023 was used. The TE analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated with the tax-exempt assets. The year-to-date net yield on interest-earning assets excluding the TE adjustments of 2.3 million and 2.3 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively were 3.26 and 2.90 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

1. Changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 

2. The tax-exempt income is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. 

3. Nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances. 

Tax equivalent net interest income increased 33.8 million, or 24.4 , to 172.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 138.3 million for the same period in 2023. Net interest income and net interest margin increased primarily due to an increase in earning asset yields partially offset by the increase in deposit and borrowing rates. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average earning assets increased 618.8 million, or 9.9 , and average interest-bearing liabilities increased 427.8 million or 8.7 compared with average balances for the same period in 2023. 
 The changes in average balances for these periods are shown below: 
 Average interest-bearing deposits with other financial institutions increased 106.3 million or 223.7 . 

Average federal funds sold decreased 7.7 million or 95.3 . 

Average certificates of deposits investments increased 1.0 million or 53.9 .

Following are explanations of the changes in these other income categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023: 
 Wealth management revenues increased for the nine month period due to increased brokerage and trust fees, partially offset by less agricultural services fee incomes. 

Insurance commissions increased primarily due to organic growth and the acquisitions of PGIB and MRIG during the second quarter of 2023 and third quarter of 2024, respectively. 

Fees from service charges increased during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank in the third quarter of 2023. 

Net losses from the sale of securities during 2024 were 0.4 million compared to net gains in 2023 of 3.3 million. The Company sold 37 securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with the intent to replace them with higher yielding assets and restructured the balance sheet of Blackhawk Bank after the acquisition in 2023. 

The increase in mortgage banking income was due to an increase from loans sold in the secondary market and the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank in the third quarter of 2023. First Mid Bank generally releases the servicing rights on loans sold into the secondary market. 

100.5 million (representing 579 loans) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

45.5 million (representing 318 loans) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue from ATMs and debit cards increased due to an increase in activity during the period and the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank in the third quarter of 2023. 

Bank owned life insurance income decreased approximately 0.3 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a claim payout in 2023. 

Other income increased primarily due to gains recognized on the repayment of the Company's subordinated debentures being partially offset by late charges on loans being presented as interest income starting in 2024.

Following are explanations for the changes in these other expense categories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023: 
 The increase in salaries and employee benefits, the largest component of other expense, is primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank and regularly scheduled annual raises occurring during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. This was partially offset by the Company's efficiency improvement efforts. There were 1,207 and 1,224 full-time equivalent employees at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The increase in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank during the third quarter of 2023. 

The decrease in net other real estate owned expense for the nine month period was primarily due to significantly less write downs of other real estate owned compared to the same period in 2023. 

Expense for amortization of intangible assets increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights increased due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank during the third quarter of 2023. In addition, PGIB was acquired in the second quarter of 2023 and MRIG was acquired in the third quarter of 2024. 

The increase in all other operating expenses during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to the acquisition of Blackhawk Bank during the third quarter of 2023. 

Income Taxes 
 Total income tax expense amounted to 19.3 million (24.4 effective tax rate) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.9 million (23.7 effective tax rate) for the same period in 2023. The increase in effective rate is primarily related to a one time increase in income tax expense required because of the State of Illinois income apportionment law change that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 The Company files U.S. federal and state of Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin income tax returns. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020.

Analysis of Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 Securities 
 The Company s overall investment objectives are to insulate the investment portfolio from undue credit risk, maintain adequate liquidity, insulate capital against changes in market value and control excessive changes in earnings while optimizing investment performance. The types and maturities of securities purchased are primarily based on the Company s current and projected liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions. The following table sets forth the amortized cost of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Loan balances increased 34.0 million, or 0.6 . The increase was primarily due to various types of commercial loans increasing and increased seasonal demand for agricultural operating loans partially offset by decreases in consumer loans and agricultural, construction, and 1-4 family residential properties real estate loans decreasing. The balance of real estate loans held for sale, included in the balances shown above, amounted to 8.1 million and 5.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Commercial and commercial real estate loans generally involve higher credit risks than residential real estate and consumer loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate or equipment are often dependent upon the successful operation and management of the underlying assets, repayment of such loans may be influenced to a great extent by conditions in the market or the economy. The Company does not have any sub-prime mortgages or credit card loans outstanding which are also generally considered to be higher credit risk. 
 Loans are geographically dispersed throughout Illinois, the St. Louis Metro area, central Missouri, Texas, and southern Wisconsin. While these regions have experienced some economic stress during 2024 and 2023, the Company does not consider these locations high risk areas since these regions have not experienced the significant changes in real estate values seen in some other areas in the United States. 
 First Mid Bank does not have a concentration, as defined by the regulatory agencies, in construction and land development loans or commercial real estate loans as a percentage of the sum of Tier 1 Capital and allowance for loan loss for the periods shown above. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, First Mid Bank did have industry loan concentrations that exceeded 25 of the sum of Tier 1 Capital and allowance for loan loss in the following industries (dollars in thousands):

1. Based upon remaining contractual maturity. 

2. Includes demand loans, past due loans and overdrafts. 

As of September 30, 2024, loans with maturities over one year consisted of approximately 2.8 billion in fixed rate loans and approximately 1.8 billion in variable rate loans. The loan maturities noted above are based on the contractual provisions of the individual loans. The Company has no general policy regarding renewals and borrower requests, which are handled on a case-by-case basis. 
 Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Other Assets 
 Nonperforming loans include: (a) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; (b) accruing loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments; and (c) loans not included in (a) and (b) above which are defined as modified . Repossessed assets include primarily repossessed real estate and automobiles. 
 The Company s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which principal or interest is ninety days past due. The accrual of interest is discontinued earlier when, in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current year income. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. 
 Restructured loans are loans on which, due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition, the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven. Repossessed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. These assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure or repossession. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs for subsequent declines in value are recorded in non-interest expense in other real estate owned along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties.

 Loan Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the reserve necessary to adequately account for probable losses existing in the current portfolio. The provision for loan losses is the charge against current earnings that is determined by management as the amount needed to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, and therefore the provision to be charged to current earnings, management relies predominantly on a disciplined credit review and approval process that extends to the full range of the Company s credit exposure. The review process is directed by overall lending policy and is intended to identify, at the earliest possible stage, borrowers who might be facing financial difficulty. Factors considered by management in evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance include a migration analysis of the historical net loan losses by loan segment, the level and composition of nonaccrual, past due and renegotiated loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards or lending practices, lending staff changes, concentrations of credit, industry conditions and the current economic conditions in the region where the Company operates. 
 Management reviews economic factors including the potential for reduced cash flow for commercial operating loans from reduction in sales or increased operating costs, decreased occupancy rates for commercial buildings, reduced levels of home sales for commercial land developments, the uncertainty regarding grain prices, increased operating costs for farmers, and increased levels of unemployment and bankruptcy impacting consumer s ability to pay. Each of these economic uncertainties was taken into consideration in developing the level of the reserve. Management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy. 
 Management recognizes there are risk factors that are inherent in the Company s loan portfolio. All financial institutions face risk factors in their loan portfolios because risk exposure is a function of the business. The Company s operations (and therefore its loans) are concentrated in Illinois, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin areas, where agriculture is the dominant industry. Accordingly, lending and other business relationships with agriculture-based businesses are critical to the Company s success. At September 30, 2024, the 
 53 

Company s loan portfolio included 618.4 million of loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture. Of this amount, 508.2 million was concentrated in other grain farming. Total loans to borrowers whose businesses are directly related to agriculture increased 29.9 million from 588.5 million at December 31, 2023 while loans concentrated in other grain farming increased 35.8 million from 472.5 million at December 31, 2023. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting practices, including collateralization of loans, any extended period of low commodity prices, drought conditions, significantly reduced yields on crops and/or reduced levels of government assistance to the agricultural industry could result in an increase in the level of problem agriculture loans and potentially result in loan losses within the agricultural portfolio. In addition, the Company has 226.7 million of loans to motels and hotels. The performance of these loans is dependent on borrower specific issues as well as the general level of business and personal travel within the region. While the Company adheres to sound underwriting standards, a prolonged period of reduced business or personal travel could result in an increase in nonperforming loans to this business segment and potentially in loan losses. The Company also has 1.1 billion of loans to lessors of non-residential buildings, and 559.7 million of loans to lessors of residential buildings and dwellings. 
 The structure of the Company s loan approval process is based on progressively larger lending authorities granted to individual loan officers, loan committees, and ultimately the Board of Directors. Outstanding balances to one borrower or affiliated borrowers are limited by federal regulation; however, limits well below the regulatory thresholds are generally observed. Most of the Company s loans are to businesses located in the geographic market areas served by the Company s branch bank system. Additionally, a significant portion of the collateral securing the loans in the portfolio is located within the Company s primary geographic footprint. In general, the Company adheres to loan underwriting standards consistent with industry guidelines for all loan segments. 
 The Company minimizes credit risk by adhering to sound underwriting and credit review policies. Management and the board of directors of the Company review these policies at least annually. Senior management is actively involved in business development efforts and the maintenance and monitoring of credit underwriting and approval. The loan review system and controls are designed to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems in an accurate and timely manner. The board of directors and management review the status of problem loans each month and formally determine a best estimate of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. In addition to internal policies and controls, regulatory authorities periodically review asset quality and the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

The Company is party to a revolving credit agreement with The Northern Trust Company in the amount of 15.0 million. There was no balance on this line of credit as of September 30, 2024. This loan was renewed on April 5, 2024 for one year as a revolving credit agreement. The interest rate is floating at 2.25 over the federal funds rate. The Company and First Mid Bank, as applicable, were in compliance with the existing covenants at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023. 
 On October 6, 2020, the Company issued and sold 96.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.95 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2030 (the Notes ). The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the Base Indenture ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 6, 2020 (the Supplemental Indenture ), between the Company and the Trustee. The Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, governs the terms of the Notes and provides that the Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on October 15, 2030. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding October 15, 2025, the Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.95 per annum. From and including October 15, 2025 to, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 383 basis points, or such other rate as determined pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture, provided that in no event shall the applicable floating interest rate be less than zero per annum. On June 7, 2024, August 27, 2024, and September 6, 2024, the Company repurchased in open market transactions and subsequently cancelled 4.0 million, 15.0 million, and 1.0 million respectively, of the outstanding Notes. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, 76 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes remain issued and outstanding. 
 The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of October 15, 2025, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Notes at any time, including prior to October 15, 2025, at the Company s option, in whole but not in part, if: (i) a change or prospective change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a subsequent event occurs that could preclude the Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes; or (iii) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date. 
 On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed, as part of the Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. acquisition, 7.5 million principal amount of 3.5 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I ). Blackhawk Subordinated Debt I was issued pursuant to Indenture between the Company and UMB Bank, as trustee (the Trustee ). The Indenture governs the terms of the Notes and provides that the Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on May 14, 2031. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding May 14, 2026, the Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.5 per annum. From and including May 14, 2026 to, but excluding the maturity date, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 285 basis points. 
 On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed, as part of the Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. acquisition, 7.5 million principal amount of 3.875 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2036 Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II ). Blackhawk Subordinated Debt II was issued pursuant to Indenture between the Company and UMB Bank, as trustee (the Trustee ). The Indenture governs the terms of the Notes and provides that the Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on May 14, 
 58 

2036. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding May 14, 2031, the Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.875 per annum. From and including May 14, 2031 to, but excluding the maturity date, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 255 basis points. 
 On April 26, 2006, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 10.0 million of fixed/floating rate trust preferred securities through First Mid-Illinois Statutory Trust II Trust II ), a statutory business trust and wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, as part of a pooled offering. The Company established Trust II for the purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities. The 10.0 million in proceeds from the trust preferred issuance and an additional 0.3 million for the Company s investment in common equity of Trust II, a total of 10.3 million, was invested in junior subordinated debentures of the Company. The underlying junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to Trust II mature in 2036, bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.98 paid quarterly until June 15, 2011 and then converted to floating rate (SOFR plus 160 basis points, 6.81 and 7.25 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively). 
 On September 8, 2016, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Clover Leaf Statutory Trust I CLST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First Clover Financial. The 4.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional 0.1 million investment in common equity of CLST I, is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to CLST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2025, bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 185 basis points (7.06 and 7.50 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. 
 On May 1, 2018, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of FBTC Statutory Trust I FBTCST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of First BancTrust Corporation. The 6.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional 0.1 million investment in common equity of FBTCST I is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to FBTCST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2035, bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 170 basis points (6.91 and 7.35 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. 
 On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Blackhawk Statutory Trust I BHST I ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. The 1.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional 31,000 investment in common equity of BHST I is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to BHST I. The subordinated debentures mature in 2032, bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 325 basis points (8.17 and 8.87 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. 
 On August 15, 2023, the Company assumed the trust preferred securities of Blackhawk Statutory Trust II BHST II ), a statutory business trust that was a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary of Blackhawk Bancorp, Inc. The 4.0 million of trust preferred securities and an additional 0.1 million investment in common equity of BHST II is invested in junior subordinated debentures issued to BHST II. The subordinated debentures mature in 2035, bear interest at three-month SOFR plus 205 basis points (7.25 and 7.69 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) and resets quarterly. 
 The trust preferred securities issued by Trust II, CLST I, FBTCST I, BHST I, and BHST II are included as Tier 1 capital of the Company for regulatory capital purposes. On March 1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes. The final rule provided a five-year transition period, ending September 30, 2010, for application of the revised quantitative limits. On March 17, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board adopted an additional final rule that delayed the effective date of the new limits on inclusion of trust preferred securities in the calculation of Tier 1 capital until March 31, 2012. The application of the revised quantitative limits did not and is not expected to have a significant impact on its calculation of Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes or its classification as well-capitalized. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law July 21, 2010, removes trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company s Tier 1 capital after a three-year phase-in period beginning January 1, 2013 for larger holding companies. For holding companies with less than 15.0 billion in consolidated assets, existing issues of trust preferred securities are grandfathered and not subject to this new restriction. 
 Similarly, the final rule implementing the Basel III reforms allows holding companies with less than 15.0 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 to continue to count toward Tier 1 capital any trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010. New issuances of trust preferred securities, however, would not count as Tier 1 regulatory capital. 
 In addition to requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the act also required the federal banking agencies to adopt certain rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). This rule is generally referred to as the Volcker Rule. The rules permit the retention of an interest in or sponsorship of covered funds by banking entities under 15.0 billion in assets (such as the Company) if (1) the collateralized debt obligation was established and issued prior to May 19, 2010, (2) the banking entity reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the collateralized debt obligation were invested primarily in qualifying trust preferred collateral, and (3) the banking entity s interests in the collateralized debt obligation was 
 59 

acquired on or prior to December 10, 2013. The Company does not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of the Company or First Mid Bank. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 The Company seeks to maximize its net interest margin while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk can be defined as the amount of forecasted net interest income that may be gained or lost due to changes in the interest rate environment, a variable over which management has no control. Interest rate risk, or sensitivity, arises when the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest-bearing assets differ significantly from the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest- bearing liabilities. The Company monitors its interest rate sensitivity position to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. This balance serves to limit the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. The Company s asset liability management committee (ALCO) oversees the interest rate sensitivity position and directs the overall allocation of funds. 
 In the banking industry, a traditional way to measure potential net interest income exposure to changes in interest rates is through a technique known as static GAP analysis which measures the cumulative differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at various intervals. By comparing the volumes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities that have contractual maturities and repricing points at various times in the future, management can gain insight into the amount of interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet. The following table sets forth the Company s interest rate repricing GAP for selected maturity periods at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

The static GAP analysis shows that at September 30, 2024, the Company was liability sensitive, on a cumulative basis, through the twelve-month time horizon. This indicates that future increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income. There are several ways the Company measures and manages the exposure to interest rate sensitivity, including static GAP analysis. The Company s ALCO also uses other financial models to project interest income under various rate scenarios and prepayment/extension assumptions consistent with First Mid Bank s historical experience and with known industry trends. ALCO meets at least monthly to review the Company s exposure to interest rate changes as indicated by the various techniques and to make necessary changes in the composition terms and/or rates of the assets and liabilities. 
 Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s stockholders' equity increased 65.3 million or 8.2 , to 858.5 million from 793.2 million as of December 31, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, net income contributed 59.7 million to equity before the payment of dividends to stockholders. The change in market value of available-for-sale investment securities increased stockholders' equity by 19.7 million, net of tax. Dividends of 16.7 million were paid during the first nine months of 2024. 
 The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Bank holding companies follow minimum regulatory requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve System ), First Mid Bank follows similar minimum regulatory requirements established for banks by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as applicable. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary action by regulators that, if undertaken, could have 
 60 

a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Quantitative measures established by regulatory capital standards to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and its subsidiary bank to maintain minimum capital amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below). Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and First Mid Bank, as applicable, met all capital adequacy requirements. 
 As permitted by the interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020 by the federal banking regulatory agencies, the Company elected the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital of adopting ASU 2016-13, which was effective January 1, 2020. The initial impact of adoption of ASU 2016-13, as well as 25 of the quarterly increases in allowance for credit losses subsequent to adoption of ASU 2016-13 was delayed for two years. After two years, the cumulative amount of these adjustments is being phased out of the regulatory capital calculation over a three-year period, with 75 of the adjustments included in 2022, 50 of the adjustments included in 2023 and 25 of the adjustments included in 2024. After five years, the temporary delay of ASU 2016-13 adoption will be fully reversed. 
 To be categorized as well-capitalized, total risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios must be maintained as set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands):

Stock Plans 
 Participants may purchase Company stock under the following three plans of the Company: The Deferred Compensation Plan, the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, and the Stock Incentive Plan. For more detailed information on these plans, refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held April 26, 2017, the stockholders approved the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan ("SI Plan"). The SI Plan was implemented to succeed the Company s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, which had a ten-year term. The SI Plan is intended to provide a means whereby directors, employees, consultants and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries may sustain a sense of proprietorship and personal involvement in the continued development and financial success of the Company and its Subsidiaries, thereby advancing the interests of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, directors and selected employees, consultants and advisors may be provided the opportunity to acquire shares of Common Stock of the Company on the terms and conditions established in the SI Plan. 
 Following the stockholders approval at the 2021 annual meeting of the Company, a maximum of 399,983 shares of common stock may be issued under the SI Plan. The Company awarded 53,766 and 60,550 restricted stock awards during 2024 and 2023, respectively and 39,150 and 37,900 as stock unit awards during 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held April 25, 2018, the stockholders approved the First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP ). The ESPP is intended to promote the interests of the Company by providing eligible employees with the opportunity to purchase shares of common stock of the Company at a 15 discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP is also intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. A maximum of 600,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the ESPP. As of September 30, 2024, 119,047 shares have been issued pursuant to the ESPP. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 25,319 shares and 28,762 shares, respectively, were issued pursuant to the ESPP. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 Since August 5, 1998, the Board of Directors has approved repurchase programs pursuant to which the Company may repurchase a total of approximately 76.7 million of the Company s common stock. During 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. The Company has approximately 4.1 million in remaining capacity under its existing repurchase program. 
 Although the Company adopted the repurchase plan, the Company may make discretionary repurchases in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time. The timing, manner, price and amount of any such repurchases will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend upon a variety of factors including economic and market conditions, price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity represents the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to meet all present and future financial obligations arising in the daily operations of the business. Financial obligations consist of the need for funds to meet extensions of credit, deposit withdrawals and debt servicing. The Company s liquidity management focuses on the ability to obtain funds economically through assets that may be converted into cash at minimal costs or through other sources. The Company s other sources of cash include overnight federal fund lines, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, deposits of the State of Illinois, the ability to borrow at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and the Company s operating line of credit with The Northern Trust Company. 
 Details of the Company's liquidity sources include: 
 First Mid Bank has 120 million available in overnight federal fund lines, including 30 million from First Horizon Bank, N.A., 20 million from U.S. Bank, N.A., 10 million from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 15 million from The Northern Trust Company, 25 million from Zions Bank, and 20 million from BMO Bank, N.A. Availability of the funds is subject to First Mid Bank meeting minimum regulatory capital requirements for total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to total average assets. As of September 30, 2024, First Mid Bank met these regulatory requirements. 

First Mid Bank can borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank as a source of liquidity. Availability of the funds is subject to the pledging of collateral to the Federal Home Loan Bank. Collateral that can be pledged includes one-to-four family residential real estate loans and securities. At September 30, 2024, the excess collateral at the FHLB would support approximately 1.6 billion of additional advances for First Mid Bank. 

62 

First Mid Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and can borrow funds provided that sufficient collateral is pledged. 

In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had a revolving credit agreement in the amount of 15.0 million with The Northern Trust Company with an outstanding balance of 0 and 15.0 million in available funds. This loan was renewed on April 5, 2024 for one year as a revolving credit agreement. The interest rate is floating at 2.25 over the federal funds rate. The loan is unsecured. The Company and its subsidiary bank were in compliance with the existing covenants at September 30, 2024 and 2023 and December 31, 2023. 

Management continues to monitor its expected liquidity requirements carefully, focusing primarily on cash flows from: 
 lending activities, including loan commitments, letters of credit and mortgage prepayment assumptions; 

deposit activities, including seasonal demand of private and public funds; 

investing activities, including prepayments of mortgage-backed securities and call provisions on U.S. Treasury and government agency securities; and 

operating activities, including scheduled debt repayments and dividends to stockholders.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash of 86.2 million was provided by operating activities, 39.5 million was provided by investing activities, and 104.5 million was used in financing activities. In total, cash and cash equivalents increased by 21.1 million since year-end 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 First Mid Bank enters into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include lines of credit, letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit. Each of these instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses the same credit policies and requires similar collateral in approving lines of credit and commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does in making loans. The exposure to credit losses on financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. However, the Company does not anticipate any losses from these instruments. The off-balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):

Commitments to originate credit represent approved commercial, residential real estate and home equity loans that generally are expected to be funded within ninety days. Lines of credit are agreements by which the Company agrees to provide a borrowing accommodation up to a stated amount as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement. Both commitments to originate credit and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the lines and some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
 63 

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the financial performance of customers to third parties. Standby letters of credit are primarily issued to facilitate trade or support borrowing arrangements and generally expire in one year or less. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit facilities to customers. The maximum amount of credit that would be extended under letters of credit is equal to the total off-balance sheet contract amount of such instrument. The Company's deferred revenue under standby letters of credit was nominal. 
 The Company is also subject to claims and lawsuits that arise primarily in the ordinary course of business. It is the opinion of management that the disposition of ultimate resolution of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There has been no material change in the market risk faced by the Company since December 31, 2023. For information regarding the Company s market risk, refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Further, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to affect materially the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time the Company and its subsidiaries may be involved in litigation that the Company believes is a type common to our industry. None of any such existing claims are believed to be individually material at this time to the Company, although the outcome of any such existing claims cannot be predicted with certainty. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS
