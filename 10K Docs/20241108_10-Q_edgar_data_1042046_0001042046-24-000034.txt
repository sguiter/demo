 investment professionals whose primary responsibility is to manage AFG s investment portfolio. These professionals monitor individual investments as well as overall industries and are active in the financial markets on a daily basis. The group is led by AFG s chief investment officer, who reports directly to one of AFG s Co-CEOs. Valuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG s internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with the pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the service to value specific securities.

 million) of the total fair value of Level 3 assets at September 30, 2024. Approximately million) of these internally developed Level 3 assets are priced using a pricing model that uses a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of fixed maturity securities. The credit spread applied by management is the significant unobservable input of the pricing model. In instances where the security is currently callable at par value and the pricing model suggests a higher price, management caps the fair value at par value. Approximately million) of the internally developed Level 3 assets are equity securities which are priced primarily using internal models with some inputs that are not market observable. Management believes that any justifiable changes in unobservable inputs used to determine internally developed fair values would not have resulted in a material change in AFG s financial position.

 The earnings (losses) from these investments are generally reported on a quarter lag due to the timing required to obtain the necessary information from the funds. AFG regularly reviews and discusses fund performance with the fund managers to corroborate the reasonableness of the underlying reported asset values and to assess whether any events have occurred within the lag period that may materially affect the valuation of these investments.

 At September 30, 2024, the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities of million relate to approximately securities. Investment grade securities (as determined by nationally recognized rating agencies) represented approximately of the gross unrealized loss and of the fair value of securities with unrealized losses. 
 
 To evaluate fixed maturities for expected credit losses (impairment), management considers whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates, the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis, historical operating, balance sheet and cash flow data from the issuer, third party research and communications with industry specialists and discussions with issuer management. 
 
 AFG analyzes its MBS for expected credit losses (impairment) each quarter based upon expected future cash flows. Management estimates expected future cash flows based upon its knowledge of the MBS market, cash flow projections (which reflect loan to collateral values, subordination, vintage and geographic concentration) received from independent sources, implied cash flows inherent in security ratings and analysis of historical payment data. 
 
 Management believes AFG will recover its cost basis (net of any allowance) in the securities with unrealized losses and that AFG has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at September 30, 2024.

 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Fixed maturities with embedded derivatives Fixed maturities Total return swap Other assets/Other liabilities 
 
 AFG s interest rate swaps are designated and qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges to mitigate interest rate risk related to certain floating-rate securities included in AFG s portfolio of fixed maturity securities. The purpose of each of these swaps is to effectively convert a portion of AFG s floating-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates by offsetting the variability in cash flows attributable to changes in the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). 
 
 Under the terms of the swaps, AFG receives fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for variable interest payments based on SOFR. The notional amounts of the interest rate swaps generally decline over each swap s respective life (the swaps expire between October 2024 and July 2028) in anticipation of the expected decline in AFG s portfolio of fixed maturity securities with floating interest rates based on SOFR. The total outstanding notional amount of AFG s interest rate swaps was billion at September 30, 2024 compared to billion at December 31, 2023, reflecting scheduled amortization and the expiration of swaps with a total notional amount at expiration of million during the third quarter of 2024. Amounts reclassified from AOCI to net earnings were losses of million and million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and losses of million and million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Based on forward interest rate curves at September 30, 2024, management estimates that it will reclassify approximately million of pre-tax net losses on interest rate swaps in AOCI to net investment income over the next twelve months. The actual amount will vary based on changes in SOFR. A collateral receivable supporting these swaps of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is included in other assets in AFG s Balance Sheet.

Upon formation between 2012 and 2024, these entities issued securities in various senior and subordinate classes and invested the proceeds primarily in secured bank loans, which serve as collateral for the debt securities issued by each CLO. None of the collateral was purchased from AFG. AFG s investments in the subordinate debt tranches of these entities receive residual income from the CLOs only after the CLOs pay expenses (including management fees to AFG) and interest on and returns of capital to senior levels of debt securities. There are no contractual requirements for AFG to provide additional funding for these entities. AFG has not provided and does not intend to provide any financial support to these entities. 
 
 AFG s maximum exposure to economic loss on the CLOs that it manages is limited to its investment in those CLOs, which had an aggregate fair value of million (including million invested in the most subordinate tranches and million invested in a temporary warehousing entity) at September 30, 2024. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, AFG formed new CLOs, which issued an aggregate million face amount of liabilities (including million face amount purchased by AFG). In March 2023, AFG formed new CLO, which issued million face amount of liabilities (including million face amount purchased by AFG).

 On January 1, 2023, the two major tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act IRA became effective. The IRA created a new corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT based on the earnings that a company reports in its financial statements and imposes a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. Any CAMT incurred would be available to offset taxes payable under the standard calculation in future periods. Accordingly, the CAMT is a timing difference and would result in the recording of an offsetting deferred tax asset with no impact on overall income tax expense. Based on recently issued proposed regulations, while AFG meets the financial statement income thresholds to be subject to CAMT, management does not believe AFG will incur a CAMT liability for 2024. The excise tax on stock repurchases in excess of any issuances is recorded as part of the cost of the repurchases directly in shareholders equity.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued 

 The forward-looking statements herein are made only as of the date of this report. The Company assumes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. 

OBJECTIVE 
 The objective of Management s Discussion and Analysis is to provide a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of AFG s financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. The tables and narrative that follow are presented in a manner that is consistent with the information that AFG s management uses to make operational decisions and allocate capital resources. They are provided to demonstrate the nature of the transactions and events that could impact AFG s financial results. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page 2 . 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 Financial Condition 
 AFG is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries. AFG, however, has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses, the payment of principal and interest on borrowings, shareholder dividends, and taxes. Therefore, certain analyses are most meaningfully presented on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis. In addition, because its businesses are financial in nature, AFG does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current-noncurrent format. Consequently, certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Through the operations of its subsidiaries, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses. 
 
 AFG reported net earnings of 181 million 2.16 per share, diluted) for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 177 million 2.09 per share, diluted) for the third quarter of 2023. Higher net investment income and lower net realized losses on securities were partially offset by lower underwriting profit. 
 
 AFG reported net earnings of 632 million 7.54 per share, diluted) for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 589 million 6.93 per share, diluted) for the first nine months of 2023. The year over year increase was due primarily to the impact of higher yields on fixed maturity investments coupled with net realized gains on securities in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net realized losses on securities in the first nine months of 2023. These items were partially offset by lower returns on AFG s alternative investment portfolio and, to a lesser extent, lower underwriting profit. 
 
 Outlook 
 AFG s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the economic, legal and regulatory environment. Economic inflation, social inflation, supply chain disruption, labor shortages and other economic conditions may impact premium levels, loss cost trends and investment returns. Management believes that AFG s strong financial position and current liquidity and capital at its subsidiaries will give AFG the flexibility to continue to effectively address and respond to the ongoing uncertainties presented by the macro-economic environment and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. AFG s insurance subsidiaries continue to have capital at or in excess of the levels required by ratings agencies in order to maintain their current ratings, and the parent company does not have any near-term debt maturities. 
 
 Management expects continued premium growth and strong underwriting results in the ongoing generally favorable property and casualty insurance market. In addition, management anticipates the deployment of cash during the elevated interest rate environment (since early 2022) will continue to have a positive impact on investment income on fixed maturity investments into 2025. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A Accounting Policies to the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements. As more information becomes known, these estimates and assumptions change and, thus, impact amounts reported in the future. The areas where 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 AMERICAN FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. 10-Q 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued 

 management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements is most significant are as follows: 
 the valuation of investments, including the determination of impairment allowances, 
 the establishment of insurance reserves, especially asbestos and environmental-related reserves, 
 the recoverability of reinsurance, and 
 the establishment of asbestos and environmental liabilities of former railroad and manufacturing operations. 
 
 For a discussion of these policies, see Management s Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Policies in AFG s 2023 Form 10-K. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Ratios 
 AFG s debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below (dollars in millions): 
 December 31, September 30, 2024 2023 2022 Principal amount of long-term debt 1,498 1,498 1,521 Total capital 6,342 6,075 6,116 Ratio of debt to total capital: Including subordinated debt 23.6 24.7 24.9 Excluding subordinated debt 13.0 13.5 13.8 
 
 The ratio of debt to total capital is a non-GAAP measure that management believes is useful for investors, analysts and ratings agencies to evaluate AFG s financial strength and liquidity and to provide insight into how AFG finances its operations. The ratio is calculated by dividing the principal amount of AFG s long-term debt by its total capital, which includes long-term debt and shareholders equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax). In addition, maintaining a ratio of debt, excluding subordinated debt and debt secured by real estate (if any), to total capital of 35 or lower is a financial covenant in AFG s bank credit facility. 

Condensed Consolidated Cash Flows 
 AFG s principal sources of cash include insurance premiums, income from its investment portfolio and proceeds from the maturities, redemptions and sales of investments. Insurance premiums in excess of acquisition expenses and operating costs are invested until they are needed to meet policyholder obligations or made available to the parent company through dividends to cover debt obligations and corporate expenses, and to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as detailed in AFG s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are shown below (in millions): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 478 1,214 Net cash provided by investing activities 116 459 Net cash used in financing activities (497) (1,324) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 97 349 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities AFG s property and casualty insurance operations typically produce positive net operating cash flows as premiums collected and investment income exceed policy acquisition costs, claims payments and operating expenses. AFG s net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by the level and timing of property and casualty premiums, claim and expense payments and recoveries from reinsurers. Cash flows provided by operating activities also include the activity of AFG s managed investment entities (collateralized loan obligations CLO )) other than those activities included in investing or financing activities. The changes in the assets and liabilities of the managed investment entities included in operating activities reduced cash flows from operating activities by 67 million during the first nine months of 2024 and increased cash flows from operating activities by 26 million in the first nine months of 2023, accounting for a 93 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. As discussed in Note A Accounting Policies Managed Investment Entities to the financial statements, AFG has no right to use the CLO assets and no obligation to pay the CLO liabilities and such assets and

 liabilities are shown separately in AFG s Balance Sheet. Excluding the impact of the managed investment entities, net cash provided by operating activities was 545 million and 1.19 billion in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities AFG s investing activities consist primarily of the investment of funds provided by its property and casualty businesses. Investing activities also include the purchase and disposal of managed investment entity investments, which are presented separately in AFG s Balance Sheet. Net investment activity in the managed investment entities was a 204 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 609 million in the first nine months of 2023, accounting for a 405 million decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same 2023 period. See Note A Accounting Policies Managed Investment Entities and Note G Managed Investment Entities to the financial statements. Investing activities for the first nine months of 2023 included the July 2023 acquisition of Crop Risk Services CRS for 234 million in cash. Excluding the acquisition of CRS and the activity of the managed investment entities, investing activities were an 88 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an 84 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities AFG s financing activities consist primarily of issuances and retirements of long-term debt, issuances and repurchases of common stock and dividend payments. Net cash used in financing activities was 497 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1.32 billion in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 827 million. AFG paid cash dividends totaling 385 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 498 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease in cash used by financing activities of 113 million. There were no debt retirements in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 21 million in debt retirements during the first nine months of 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, AFG did not repurchase any of its Common Stock compared to repurchases of 153 million in the comparable 2023 period. Financing activities also include issuances and retirements of managed investment entity liabilities, which are nonrecourse to AFG and presented separately in AFG s Balance Sheet. Retirements of managed investment entity liabilities exceeded issuances by 125 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 663 million in the first nine months of 2023, accounting for a 538 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. See Note A Accounting Policies Managed Investment Entities and Note G Managed Investment Entities to the financial statements. 

Parent and Subsidiary Liquidity 
 
 Parent Holding Company Liquidity Management believes AFG has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements. If funds generated from operations, including dividends, tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries, are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period, AFG would be required to utilize parent company cash and investments or to generate cash through borrowings, sales of other assets or similar transactions. 
 
 AFG's operations continue to generate significant excess capital for future returns of capital to shareholders in the form of regular and special cash dividends and through opportunistic share repurchases or to be deployed into its property and casualty businesses as management identifies the potential for profitable organic growth, and opportunities to expand through acquisitions of established businesses or start-ups that meet target return thresholds. 
 
 AFG paid a special cash dividend totaling 209 million 2.50 per share) on February 28, 2024. On November 5, 2024, AFG declared a special cash dividend of 4.00 per share, payable on November 26, 2024. The aggregate amount of this special dividend will be approximately 335 million. 
 
 AFG may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as management may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, AFG s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 
 During 2023, AFG repurchased 1,872,544 shares of its Common Stock for 213 million, paid special cash dividends totaling 466 million 4.00 per share in February and 1.50 per share in November) and repurchased 23 million principal amount of its senior notes for 21 million cash. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, AFG (parent) held approximately 382 million in cash and investments. Management believes that AFG s cash balances are held at stable banking institutions, although the amounts of many of these deposits are in excess of federally insured balances. AFG can borrow up to 450 million under its revolving credit facility, which expires in June 2028. Amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at rates ranging from 1.00 to 1.75 (based on AFG s 
 36 

Table of Contents

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued 

 credit rating, currently 1.25 over a SOFR-based floating rate. There were no borrowings under AFG s credit facilities, or under any other parent company short-term borrowing arrangements, during 2023 or the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Under a tax allocation agreement with AFG, all 80 (or more) owned U.S. subsidiaries generally pay taxes to (or recover taxes from) AFG based on each subsidiary s contribution to amounts due under AFG s consolidated tax return. 
 
 Subsidiary Liquidity The liquidity requirements of AFG s insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the policyholder claims and underwriting expenses and payments of dividends and taxes to AFG. Historically, cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements. Funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in marketable securities. In addition, the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid, short duration investments. 
 
 AFG believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and underwriting expenses. In addition, these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies, inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies. Management believes that the capital levels in AFG s insurance subsidiaries are adequate to maintain its business and rating agency ratings. Nonetheless, changes in statutory accounting rules, significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments, could create a need for additional capital. 

Investments 
 AFG s investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, contained 10.44 billion in fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and 78 million in fixed maturities classified as trading with holding gains and losses included in net investment income. In addition, AFG s investment portfolio includes 510 million in equity securities carried at fair value with holding gains and losses included in realized gains (losses) on securities and 571 million in equity securities carried at fair value with holding gains and losses included in net investment income. 
 
 Fair values for AFG s portfolio are determined by AFG s internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services, non-binding broker quotes and other market information. Fair values of equity securities are determined by published closing prices when available. For equity investments in limited partnerships and similar investments that do not qualify for equity method accounting, fair value is determined based on financial information provided by the limited partnerships. For AFG s fixed maturity portfolio, approximately 89 was priced using pricing services at September 30, 2024 and 4 was priced using non-binding broker quotes. When prices obtained for the same security vary, AFG s internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price. 
 
 The pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis. Based upon information provided by the pricing services, these inputs include, but are not limited to, recent reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, bids or offers, reference data, and measures of volatility. Included in the pricing of mortgage-backed securities MBS are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on brokers prices are classified as Level 3 in the GAAP hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated, for example, by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs. 
 
 Valuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by AFG s internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price. To validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained, these investment managers consider widely published indices (as benchmarks), recent trades, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers. In addition, AFG communicates directly with pricing services regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing, including verifying, on a test basis, the inputs used by the services to value specific securities.

 In general, the fair value of AFG s fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG s fixed maturity portfolio that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have had at September 30, 2024 (dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional. 
 
 Fair value of fixed maturity portfolio 10,513 Percentage impact on fair value of 100 bps increase in interest rates (3.0 Pretax impact on fair value of fixed maturity portfolio (315) 
 Approximately 94 of the fixed maturities held by AFG at September 30, 2024, were rated investment grade (credit rating of AAA to BBB) by nationally recognized rating agencies, 3 were rated non-investment grade and 3 were not rated. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non-investment grade. Management believes that the high-quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return. 
 AFG has less than 100 million of direct exposure to office commercial real estate through property ownership, mortgages or equity method investments. AFG s fixed maturity portfolio includes securities (the majority of which are AAA-rated) with a carrying value of approximately 500 million that have minimal exposure to office commercial real estate. 
 
 Summarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in AFG s Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024, is shown in the following table (dollars in millions). Approximately 415 million of available for sale fixed maturity securities had no unrealized gains or losses at September 30, 2024.

 When a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, an allowance for credit losses (impairment) is charged to earnings (accounted for as a realized loss). The determination of whether unrealized losses are other-than-temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors as detailed in AFG s 2023 Form 10-K under Management s Discussion and Analysis Investments.

Based on its analysis, management believes AFG will recover its cost basis (net of any allowance) in the fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses and that AFG has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at September 30, 2024. Although AFG has the ability to continue holding its fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses, its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness, decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry, asset/liability management decisions, market movements, changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains. Should AFG s ability or intent change regarding a particular security, a charge for impairment would likely be required. While it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired, increases in the allowance for credit losses could be material to results of operations in future periods. Significant declines in the fair value of AFG s investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on AFG s liquidity. For information on AFG s realized gains (losses) on securities, see Results of Operations Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities. 

Uncertainties 
 Management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations. See Management s Discussion and Analysis Uncertainties Asbestos and Environmental-related A E Insurance Reserves in AFG s 2023 Form 10 K.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

General 
 AFG s net earnings, determined in accordance with GAAP, include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. Core net operating earnings excludes realized gains (losses) on securities because such gains and losses are influenced significantly by financial markets, interest rates and the timing of sales. In addition, special charges related to coverage that AFG no longer writes, such as asbestos and environmental exposures, are excluded from core earnings. 
 
 The following table (in millions, except per share amounts) identifies non-core items and reconciles net earnings to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure. AFG believes core net operating earnings is a useful tool for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends and for management to evaluate financial performance against historical results because it believes this provides a more comparable measure of its continuing business.

 Net earnings were 181 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 177 million in the third quarter of 2023 reflecting lower net realized losses on securities in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by lower core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 14 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 as higher net investment income was more than offset by lower underwriting profit.

 Net realized gains (losses) on securities in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 include after-tax gains of 8 million and after-tax losses of 6 million, respectively, resulting from the change in fair value of equity securities that were still held at the balance sheet date. 
 
 Net earnings were 632 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 589 million in the first nine months of 2023 reflecting net realized gains on securities in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net realized losses on securities in the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by lower core net operating earnings. Core net operating earnings for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 17 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. Higher investment income outside of alternative investments was more than offset by lower returns on AFG s alternative investment portfolio, lower underwriting profit, lower other income and higher other expenses. Net realized gains (losses) on securities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 include after-tax gains of 20 million and after-tax losses of 25 million, respectively, resulting from the change in fair value of equity securities that were still held at the balance sheet date.

Property and Casualty Insurance Segment Results of Operations 
 Performance measures such as underwriting profit or loss and related combined ratios are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company s performance. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses and loss adjustment expenses, and commissions and other underwriting expenses to premiums. A combined ratio under 100 indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect net investment income, other income, other expenses or federal income taxes. 
 
 AFG s property and casualty insurance operations contributed 291 million in GAAP pretax earnings in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 294 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 3 million (1 ). Property and casualty core pretax earnings were 291 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 298 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 7 million (2 ). The decrease in GAAP and core pretax earnings reflects lower underwriting profit, partially offset by higher net investment income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.

 AFG reports the underwriting performance of its Specialty property and casualty insurance business in the following sub-segments: (i) Property and transportation, (ii) Specialty casualty and (iii) Specialty financial. 
 
 To understand the overall profitability of particular lines, the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered. Certain short-tail lines of business (primarily property coverages) generally have quick loss payouts, which reduce the time funds are held, thereby limiting investment income earned thereon. In contrast, long-tail lines of business (primarily liability coverages and workers compensation) generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle, thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received.

 Gross written premiums for the third quarter of 2024 increased 608 million (19 compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by additional premiums from the CRS acquisition. Gross and net written premiums excluding crop insurance each grew 7 year over year reflecting new business opportunities, increased exposures and a good renewal rate environment. Overall average renewal rates increased approximately 7 in the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the workers compensation businesses, renewal rates increased approximately 8 . 
 
 Property and transportation Gross written premiums increased 515 million (32 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The primary drivers of this growth included additional premiums from the CRS acquisition and, to a lesser extent, later reporting of crop acreage, which shifted the timing of reporting of some crop premium from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2024. Excluding crop premiums, gross and net written premiums each grew by 11 year over year in this group, which is attributable primarily to new business opportunities, a favorable rate environment and increased exposures in the commercial auto, property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses. Average renewal rates increased approximately 7 for this group in the third quarter of 2024. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 3 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 reflecting the impact of higher premiums in the crop business, which cedes a larger percentage of premiums than some of the other businesses in the Property and transportation sub-segment. 
 
 Specialty casualty Gross written premiums increased 71 million (6 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Year-over-year premium growth resulted primarily from new business opportunities and favorable renewal pricing in several of the targeted markets businesses and the excess liability business. The mergers and acquisition business also benefited from an increase in mergers and acquisition activity. This growth was tempered by slightly lower workers compensation premiums. Average renewal rates increased approximately 8 for this group in the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the workers compensation businesses, renewal rates for this group increased approximately 10 . Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums increased 1 percentage point in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 reflecting higher cessions in the excess and surplus, mergers and acquisitions and public sector businesses, partially offset by lower cessions in the social services business. 
 
 Specialty financial Gross written premiums increased 22 million (7 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to growth in the financial institutions business. Average renewal rates increased approximately 6 for this group in the third quarter of 2024. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased 2 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The impact of lower gross written premiums in the innovative markets business, which cedes a larger percentage of premiums than some of the other businesses in the Specialty financial sub-segment was partially offset by the impact of higher cessions in the financial institutions and fidelity businesses. 
 
 Other specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG s internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG s other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments. Reinsurance premiums assumed in the third quarter of 2024 were comparable to the third quarter of 2023.

 The Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of 117 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 143 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 26 million (18 ), reflecting lower underwriting profits in each of the Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments and higher losses in the business assumed by AFG s internal reinsurance program. Overall catastrophe losses were 90 million (4.4 points on the combined ratio) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to catastrophe losses of 56 million (3.0 points) in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Property and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was 34 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 42 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 8 million (19 ). Higher year-over-year underwriting profit in the agricultural businesses was more than offset by higher catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses were 34 million (3.6 points on the combined ratio) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 14 million (1.7 points) in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Specialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was 76 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 78 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 2 million (3 ). Higher year-over-year underwriting profitability in the targeted markets businesses was more than offset by lower year-over-year underwriting profit in the excess and surplus businesses and, to a lesser extent, the workers compensation and executive liability businesses. Catastrophe losses were 16 million (2.3 points on the combined ratio) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to catastrophe losses of 17 million (2.3 points) in the third quarter of 2023.

 Specialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was 22 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 29 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 7 million (24 ). Improved results in the lender services business were more than offset by lower year-over-year profitability in the surety and fidelity businesses. Catastrophe losses were 39 million (14.4 points on the combined ratio) compared to 22 million (9.3 points) in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Other specialty This group reported an underwriting loss of 15 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 6 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 9 million (150 ), reflecting higher losses in the business assumed by AFG s internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG s other Specialty sub-segments in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Catastrophe losses were 1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Aggregate Aggregate underwriting results for AFG s property and casualty insurance segment includes adverse prior year reserve development of 2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 1 million in the third quarter of 2023 related to business outside of the Specialty group that AFG no longer writes.

 Current accident year losses and LAE, excluding catastrophe losses 
 The current accident year loss and LAE ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, for AFG s Specialty property and casualty insurance operations was 65.9 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 66.0 for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points. 
 
 Property and transportation The 0.4 percentage points increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses, reflects growth in the crop business, which has a higher loss and LAE ratio than some of the other businesses in the Property and transportation sub-segment, higher reported losses in the commercial auto businesses and the impact of unusually low losses in the ocean marine business in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Specialty casualty The 1.8 percentage points decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses, reflects improved results in the workers compensation businesses and an isolated larger property

 loss related to the program business in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher losses in the excess and surplus businesses. 
 
 Specialty financial The 0.4 percentage points increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses, reflects lower growth in the fidelity and surety businesses and higher reported losses in the fidelity business, partially offset by growth in the financial institutions business, which has a lower loss and LAE ratio than some of the other businesses in the Specialty financial sub-segment. 
 
 Net prior year reserve development 
 AFG s Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of 17 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 44 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 27 million (61 ). 
 
 Property and transportation Net favorable reserve development of 15 million in the third quarter of 2024 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the ocean marine business and, to a lesser extent, lower than expected claim severity in the agribusiness, crop, property and inland marine and aviation businesses. Net favorable reserve development of 14 million in the third quarter of 2023 reflects lower than expected claim frequency in the property and inland marine business and lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity across the transportation businesses. 
 
 Specialty casualty Net favorable reserve development of 4 million in the third quarter of 2024 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the workers compensation businesses, partially offset by higher than anticipated claim severity in the excess liability business. Net favorable reserve development of 22 million in the third quarter of 2023 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the workers compensation businesses and lower than expected claim frequency in the executive liability and environmental businesses, partially offset by higher than anticipated claim severity in certain targeted markets businesses. 
 
 Specialty financial Net favorable reserve development of 9 million in the third quarter of 2024 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the fidelity business and lower than expected claim frequency in the financial institutions business. Net favorable reserve development of 10 million in the third quarter of 2023 reflects lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in the fidelity and surety businesses and lower than expected claim frequency in the trade credit business. 
 
 Other specialty In addition to the development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net adverse reserve development of 11 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 2 million in the third quarter of 2023 associated with AFG s internal reinsurance program and the amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive reinsurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of a business in 1998. The net adverse reserve development in 2024 is primarily related to social inflation exposed business assumed from the Specialty casualty sub-segment. 
 
 Asbestos and environmental reserves During the third quarter of 2024, AFG completed an in-depth internal review of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run-off operations of its property and casualty insurance segment and its exposures related to former railroad and manufacturing operations and sites. AFG annually conducts a comprehensive review of its asbestos and environmental reserves. In connection with its annual reviews, AFG engages with outside counsel and, as appropriate, engineering and consulting firms and specialty actuarial firms. 
 
 During the 2024 internal review, no new trends were identified and recent claims activity was generally consistent with AFG s expectations resulting from its in-depth internal reviews in the prior three years, and the most recent external study in 2020. As a result, and consistent with the internal review in the third quarter of 2023, the 2024 review resulted in no net change to AFG s property and casualty insurance segment s asbestos and environmental reserves.

 In addition, the 2024 and 2023 internal reviews encompassed reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures of AFG s former railroad and manufacturing operations. For a discussion of the 14 million and 15 million pretax non-core special charge increases in AFG s liabilities for those operations recorded in the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively, see Special A E Charges under Results of Operations Holding Company, Other and Unallocated , for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Aggregate Aggregate net prior accident years reserve development for AFG s property and casualty insurance segment includes net adverse reserve development of 2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 1 million in the third quarter of 2023 related to business outside of the Specialty group that AFG no longer writes. 
 
 Catastrophe losses 
 AFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes (whether resulting from climate change or otherwise) through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. Based on data available at December 31, 2023, AFG s exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate should statistically occur once in every 100, 250 or 500 years as a percentage of AFG s Shareholders Equity is shown below: 
 Approximate impact of modeled loss Industry Model on AFG s Shareholders Equity 100-year event 2 250-year event 2 500-year event 4 
 AFG maintains comprehensive property catastrophe reinsurance coverage for its property and casualty insurance operations, including a 70 million per occurrence net retention, for losses up to 153 million in the vast majority of circumstances. In certain unlikely events, AFG s ultimate loss under this coverage could be as high as 73 million for a single occurrence. AFG further maintains supplemental fully collateralized reinsurance coverage up to 94 of 324 million for catastrophe losses in excess of 153 million of traditional catastrophe reinsurance through a catastrophe bond. 
 
 Catastrophe losses of 90 million in the third quarter of 2024 resulted primarily from Hurricane Helene. Catastrophe losses of 56 million in the third quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from a higher frequency of lower severity convective storms in multiple regions of the United States. 
 
 Commissions and Other Underwriting Expenses 
 AFG s property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses U/W Exp were 510 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 474 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 36 million (8 ). AFG s underwriting expense ratio, calculated as commissions and other underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned, was 24.8 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 25.5 for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points.

 Property and transportation Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 0.8 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease reflects the impact of higher earned premiums on the ratio, including in the crop business that has a lower commissions and other underwriting expense ratio compared to some of the other businesses in the Property and transportation sub-segment and lower average commission rates in the transportation businesses. 
 
 Specialty casualty Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums increased 0.1 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 reflecting the impact of lower earned premiums in the workers compensation businesses on the ratio, partially offset by lower overall commission rates due to a change in the mix of business. 
 
 Specialty financial Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 2.0 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due primarily to the impact of higher earned premiums in the financial institutions business on the ratio and lower average commission rates in certain businesses. 
 
 Property and Casualty Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income in AFG s property and casualty insurance operations was 195 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 170 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 25 million (15 ). The average invested assets and overall yield earned on investments held by AFG s property and casualty insurance operations are provided below (dollars in millions):

 ) Adjusts the yield on equity securities and tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent yield. 
 
 The increase in the property and casualty insurance segment s net investment income for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 reflects the impact of higher balances of invested assets, higher returns on fixed maturity investments and higher returns on AFG s alternative investments portfolio (partnerships and similar investments and AFG-managed CLOs). The property and casualty insurance segment s overall yield on investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 5.05 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.56 for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 0.49 percentage points reflecting higher returns on both alternative investments and fixed maturity investments. The annualized return earned on alternative investments was 5.4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4.2 in the prior year period.

 Property and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net 
 Other income and expenses, net for AFG s property and casualty insurance operations was a net expense of 19 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 14 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 5 million (36 ). The table below details the items included in other income and expenses, net for AFG s property and casualty insurance operations (in millions):

 2 5 Other expenses: Amortization of intangibles 5 5 Interest expense on funds withheld 13 9 Other 3 5 Total other expenses 21 19 Other income and expenses, net (19) (14) 
 The decrease in other income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 is due to death benefits received on a company-owned life insurance policy in the third quarter of 2023. The 4 million (44 increase in interest expense on funds withheld for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 reflects the impact of higher interest rates paid on funds withheld. 

Holding Company, Other and Unallocated Results of Operations 
 AFG s net GAAP pretax loss outside of its property and casualty insurance segment (excluding realized gains and losses) totaled 60 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 56 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 4 million (7 ). AFG s net core pretax loss outside of its property and casualty insurance segment (excluding realized gains and losses) totaled 46 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 41 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 5 million (12 ).

 Holding Company and Other Net Investment Income 
 AFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its property and casualty insurance segment of 7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 10 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 3 million (30 reflecting the impact of lower average investment balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on cash and fixed maturity investments. 
 
 Holding Company and Other P C Fees and Related Expenses 
 Summit, a workers compensation insurance subsidiary, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG s property and casualty insurance businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the third quarter of 2024, AFG collected 23 million in fees for these services compared to 22 million in the third quarter of 2023. Management views this fee income, net of the 15 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 14 million in the third quarter of 2023 in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. In addition, AFG s property and casualty insurance businesses earned 15 million in fees as compensation for providing services related to the administration of crop insurance business generated by CRS for its former owner prior to the acquisition date during the third quarter of 2023. The expenses related to providing such services are embedded in property and casualty underwriting expenses. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG s segmented results. 
 
 Holding Company and Other Other Income 
 Other income in the table above includes 3 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 4 million in the third quarter of 2023 in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG s consolidated managed investment entities). The management fees are eliminated in consolidation see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under Results of Operations Segmented Statement of Earnings. Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its property and casualty insurance segment of 1 million in both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023.

 Excluding the non-core special A E charges recorded in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 discussed below, AFG s holding companies and other operations outside of its property and casualty insurance segment recorded other expenses of 38 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 37 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 1 million (3 ). 
 
 Holding Company and Other Special A E Charges 
 During the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, AFG performed in-depth internal reviews of A E exposures as discussed under Asbestos and environmental reserves under Results of Operations Property and Casualty Insurance Segment Net prior year reserve development. As a result of the 2024 and 2023 reviews, AFG s holding companies and other operations outside of its property and casualty insurance operations recorded pretax special non-core A E charges of 14 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 15 million in the third quarter of 2023 to increase liabilities related to the A E exposures of AFG s former railroad and manufacturing operations. The charges in both periods reflect changes in the scope and costs of investigation and an increase in estimated remediation costs at a limited number of sites. 
 
 Holding Company and Other Interest Charges on Borrowed Money 
 AFG s holding companies and other operations outside of its property and casualty insurance segment recorded interest expense of 19 million in both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities 
 AFG s realized gains (losses) on securities were net losses of 2 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of 17 million (89 ). Realized gains (losses) on securities consisted of the following (in millions): 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Realized gains (losses) before impairment allowances: Disposals (6) Change in the fair value of equity securities 10 (8) Change in the fair value of derivatives 3 (1) 13 (15) Change in allowance for impairments on securities (15) (4) Realized gains (losses) on securities (2) (19) 
 
 The 10 million net realized gain from the change in the fair value of equity securities in the third quarter of 2024 includes gains of 6 million on investments in banks and financing companies and 3 million on investments in media companies. The 8 million net realized loss from the change in the fair value of equity securities in the third quarter of 2023 includes losses of 10 million on investments in media companies and 2 million on investments in banks and financing companies, partially offset by gains of 4 million on investments in energy companies. 
 
 The 15 million change in allowance for impairments on securities in the third quarter of 2024 relates primarily to an allowance taken on corporate bonds from a single issuer in the financial sector. 
 
 Realized Loss on Subsidiaries 
 During the third quarter of 2023, AFG recorded a realized loss on subsidiary of 4 million, consisting of a 26 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a 22 million reduction in the fair value of a contingent consideration liability, both related to AFG s investment in Verikai. See Note E Fair Value Measurements and Note I Goodwill and Other Intangibles in AFG s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Consolidated Income Taxes 
 AFG s consolidated provision for income taxes was 48 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 42 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6 million (14 ). See Note K Income Taxes to the financial statements for an analysis of items affecting AFG s effective tax rate.

Property and Casualty Insurance Segment Results of Operations 
 AFG s property and casualty insurance operations contributed 950 million in GAAP pretax earnings in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 943 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 7 million. Property and casualty core pretax earnings were 950 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 947 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 3 million. The increase in GAAP pretax earnings reflects higher core pretax net earnings in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 The increase in core pretax net earnings reflects higher investment income outside of alternative investments in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, partially offset by lower underwriting profit, lower investment income from AFG s alternative investment portfolio (partnerships and similar investments and AFG-managed CLOs), lower other income and higher other expenses.

 Gross written premiums for the first nine months of 2024 increased 826 million (11 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Year-over-year gross written premium growth was reported within each of the Specialty property and casualty sub-segments as a result of additional crop premiums from the CRS acquisition in the Property and transportation sub-segment and new business opportunities, increased exposures and a good renewal rate environment. Overall average renewal rates increased approximately 7 in the first nine months of 2024. Excluding the workers compensation businesses, renewal pricing increased approximately 8 . 
 
 Property and transportation Gross written premiums increased 627 million (18 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Year-over-year premium growth resulted from additional crop premium associated with the CRS acquisition as well as new business opportunities, a favorable rate environment and increased exposures in the commercial auto businesses and, to a lesser extent, in the property and inland marine and ocean marine businesses. Excluding crop premium, gross and net written premiums in this group grew by 7 and 6 , respectively. Average renewal rates increased approximately 8 for this group in the first nine months of 2024.

 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflecting the impact of higher premiums in the crop business and growth in alternative risk transfer products in the transportation businesses, both of which cede a higher percentage of premiums than some of the other businesses in the Property and transportation sub-segment. 
 
 Specialty casualty Gross written premiums increased 118 million (4 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. The higher year-over-year premiums resulted primarily from growth in the excess and surplus, excess liability and certain targeted markets businesses as a result of rate increases, new business opportunities and strong policy retention. The mergers and acquisition business also benefited from an increase in mergers and acquisition activity. Average renewal rates increased approximately 6 for this group in the first nine months of 2024. Excluding overall rate decreases in the workers compensation businesses, renewal rates for this group increased approximately 9 . Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums were comparable in the first nine months of 2024 to the first nine months of 2023 reflecting lower cessions in the social services business, offset by the impact of higher premiums in the excess and surplus businesses, which cede a larger percentage of premiums than some of the other businesses in the Specialty casualty sub-segment and higher cessions in the public sector business. 
 
 Specialty financial Gross written premiums increased 81 million (10 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Year-over-year growth in the financial institutions business was partially offset by a decision to pause writing of new intellectual property-related coverage in the innovative markets business. Average renewal rates increased approximately 7 for this group in the first nine months of 2024. Reinsurance premiums ceded as a percentage of gross written premiums decreased 2 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflecting lower gross written premiums in the innovative markets business, which cedes a larger percentage of premiums than some of the other businesses in the Specialty financial sub-segment. 
 
 Other specialty The amounts shown as reinsurance premiums ceded represent business assumed by AFG s internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG s other Specialty property and casualty insurance sub-segments. Reinsurance premiums assumed decreased 10 million (5 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, reflecting a decrease in premiums retained, primarily from businesses in the Specialty casualty sub-segment.

 The Specialty property and casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of 422 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 421 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 1 million. Higher underwriting profits in the Property and transportation and Specialty financial sub-segments were partially offset by lower underwriting profit in the Specialty casualty sub-segment and higher losses in the business assumed by AFG s internal reinsurance program. Overall catastrophe losses were 161 million (3.1 points on the combined ratio), including 1 million in net reinstatement premiums in the first nine months of 2024 compared to catastrophe losses of 140 million (2.9 points), including 2 million in net reinstatement premiums in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Property and transportation Underwriting profit for this group was 129 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 117 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 12 million (10 ). Higher year-over-year underwriting profits in the property and inland marine and crop businesses were partially offset by lower underwriting profitability in the transportation businesses. Catastrophe losses were 55 million (2.7 points on the combined ratio) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 48 million (2.7 points) in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Specialty casualty Underwriting profit for this group was 258 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 261 million for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 3 million (1 ). Higher year-over-year underwriting profits in the workers compensation and the targeted markets businesses were more than offset by lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development in the executive liability business and social inflation driven adverse development in the umbrella and excess business. Catastrophe losses were 37 million (1.8 points on the combined ratio), including 1 million in net reinstatement premiums in the first nine months of 2024 compared to catastrophe losses of 28 million (1.2 points), including 2 million in net reinstatement premiums in the first nine months of 2023.

Specialty financial Underwriting profit for this group was 80 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 65 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 15 million (23 ). This year over year increase reflects higher underwriting profit in the financial institutions business, partially offset by lower profitability in the innovative markets business. Catastrophe losses were 64 million (8.4 points on the combined ratio) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 45 million (7.2 points) in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Other specialty This group reported an underwriting loss of 45 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 22 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 23 million (105 ), reflecting higher losses in the business assumed by AFG s internal reinsurance program from the operations that make up AFG s other Specialty sub-segments in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. Catastrophe losses were 5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 19 million in the first nine months of 2023.

 Property and transportation The 1.4 percentage points increase in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses, reflects growth in the crop business, which has a higher loss and LAE ratio than some of the other businesses in the Property and transportation sub-segment, higher reported losses in the commercial auto businesses and the impact of unusually low losses in the ocean marine business in the 2023 period.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued 

 Specialty casualty The 1.0 percentage points decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses, reflects improved results in the targeted markets and workers compensation businesses, partially offset by higher losses in the excess and surplus businesses. 
 
 Specialty financial The 0.7 percentage points decrease in the loss and LAE ratio for the current year, excluding catastrophe losses, reflects growth in the financial institutions business, which has a lower loss and LAE ratio than some of the other businesses in the Specialty financial sub-segment, partially offset by lower growth in the fidelity and surety businesses and higher reported losses in the fidelity business. 
 
 Net prior year reserve development 
 AFG s Specialty property and casualty insurance operations recorded net favorable reserve development related to prior accident years of 104 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 169 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 65 million (38 ). 
 
 Property and transportation Net favorable reserve development of 91 million in the first nine months of 2024 reflects lower than anticipated losses in the crop business, lower than expected claim severity in the property and inland marine and aviation businesses and lower than anticipated claim severity and frequency in the ocean marine business. Net favorable reserve development of 72 million in the first nine months of 2023 reflects lower than anticipated losses in the crop business, lower than expected claim frequency and severity across the transportation businesses and lower than anticipated claim frequency in the property and inland marine business. 
 
 Specialty casualty Net favorable reserve development of 46 million in the first nine months of 2024 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the workers compensation businesses and lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the executive liability business, partially offset by higher than anticipated claim severity in the umbrella and excess liability businesses, public sector and general liability businesses and higher than expected claim frequency and severity in the social services business. Net favorable reserve development of 73 million in the first nine months of 2023 reflects lower than anticipated claim severity in the workers compensation businesses, lower than expected claim frequency in the executive liability and environmental businesses and favorable reserve development related to COVID-19 losses across several businesses, partially offset by higher than anticipated claim severity in the public sector and excess liability businesses. 
 
 Specialty financial Net favorable reserve development of 3 million in the first nine months of 2024 reflects lower than anticipated claim frequency and severity in the fidelity and financial institutions businesses and lower than expected claim frequency in the trade credit business, partially offset by higher than anticipated claim severity in the innovative markets and surety businesses. Net favorable reserve development of 24 million in the first nine months of 2023 reflects lower than anticipated claim frequency in the trade credit and financial institutions businesses and lower than expected claim frequency and severity in the surety business. 
 
 Other specialty In addition to the development discussed above, total Specialty prior year reserve development includes net adverse reserve development of 36 million in the first nine months of 2024 and net favorable reserve development of less than 1 million in the first nine months of 2023 associated with AFG s internal reinsurance program and the amortization of the deferred gain on the retroactive reinsurance transaction entered into in connection with the sale of a business in 1998. The net adverse reserve development in 2024 is primarily related to social inflation exposed business assumed from the Specialty casualty sub-segment. 
 
 Aggregate Aggregate net prior accident years reserve development for AFG s property and casualty insurance segment includes net adverse reserve development of 4 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 1 million in the first nine months of 2023 related to business outside the Specialty group that AFG no longer writes. 
 
 Catastrophe losses 
 Catastrophe losses of 160 million in the first nine months of 2024 (before 1 million in net reinstatement premiums) resulted primarily from Hurricane Helene and storms in multiple regions of the United States. Catastrophe losses of 138 million in the first nine months of 2023 (before 2 million in net reinstatement premiums) resulted primarily from storms in multiple regions of the United States.

 Commissions and Other Underwriting Expenses 
 AFG s property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses U/W Exp were 1.49 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1.42 billion for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 79 million (6 ). AFG s underwriting expense ratio was 28.8 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 29.5 for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points. Detail of AFG s property and casualty commissions and other underwriting expenses and underwriting expense ratios is shown below (dollars in millions): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change in U/W Exp of NEP U/W Exp of NEP of NEP Property and transportation 479 23.5 449 24.4 (0.9 Specialty casualty 597 27.0 587 27.3 (0.3 Specialty financial 350 46.5 315 50.6 (4.1 Other specialty 68 36.5 64 33.0 3.5 1,494 28.8 1,415 29.5 (0.7 
 
 Property and transportation Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 0.9 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflecting the impact of higher earned premiums on the ratio, including in the crop business that has a lower commissions and other underwriting expense ratio compared to some of the other businesses in the Property and transportation sub-segment and lower average commission rates in the transportation businesses. 
 
 Specialty casualty Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 0.3 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflecting lower overall commission rates due to a change in the mix of business, partially offset by the impact of lower earned premiums in the workers compensation businesses on the ratio. 
 
 Specialty financial Commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premiums decreased 4.1 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to the impact of higher earned premiums in the financial institutions business on the ratio and lower average commission rates in certain businesses. 
 
 Property and Casualty Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income in AFG s property and casualty insurance operations was 589 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 568 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 21 million (4 ). The average invested assets and overall yield earned on investments held by AFG s property and casualty insurance operations are provided below (dollars in millions): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Net investment income: Net investment income, excluding alternative investments 464 410 54 13 Alternative investments 125 158 (33) (21 Total net investment income 589 568 21 4 Average invested assets (at amortized cost) 15,389 14,624 765 5 Yield (net investment income as a of average invested assets) 5.10 5.18 (0.08 Tax equivalent yield ) 5.16 5.25 (0.09 
 ) Adjusts the yield on equity securities and tax-exempt bonds to the fully taxable equivalent yield. 
 
 The increase in the property and casualty insurance segment s net investment income for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflects the impact of higher balances of invested assets and higher returns on fixed maturity investments, partially offset by lower returns on AFG s alternative investments portfolio (partnerships and similar investments and AFG-managed CLOs). The property and casualty insurance segment s overall yield on

 investments (net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets) was 5.10 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 5.18 for the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 0.08 percentage points reflecting lower returns on alternative investments, partially offset by higher returns on fixed maturity investments. The annualized return earned on alternative investments (partnerships and similar investments and AFG-managed CLOs) was 6.5 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 9.2 in the prior year period. 
 
 Property and Casualty Other Income and Expenses, Net 
 Other income and expenses, net for AFG s property and casualty insurance operations was a net expense of 57 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 41 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 16 million (39 ). The table below details the items included in other income and expenses, net for AFG s property and casualty insurance operations (in millions): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Other income 
 6 13 Other expenses: Amortization of intangibles 14 11 Interest expense on funds withheld 38 29 Acquisition expenses related to CRS 3 Other 
 11 11 Total other expenses 63 54 Other income and expenses, net (57) (41) 
 The decrease in other income in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 is due primarily to death benefits received on a company-owned life insurance policy in the first quarter and third quarter of 2023. The higher amortization of intangibles in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflects the acquisition of CRS in July 2023. The 9 million (31 increase in interest expense on funds withheld in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023 reflects the impact of higher interest rates paid on funds withheld. 

Holding Company, Other and Unallocated Results of Operations 
 AFG s net GAAP pretax loss outside of its property and casualty insurance segment (excluding realized gains and losses) totaled 156 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 138 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 18 million (13 ). AFG s net core pretax loss outside of its property and casualty insurance segment (excluding realized gains and losses) totaled 142 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 124 million in the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 18 million (15 ).

 The following table details AFG s GAAP and core loss before income taxes from operations outside of its property and casualty insurance segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):

 ) Excludes a pretax non-core special A E charge of 14 million in the first nine months of 2024 and a pretax non-core special A E charge of 15 million and a pretax non-core gain on retirement of debt of 1 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Holding Company and Other Net Investment Income 
 AFG recorded net investment income on investments held outside of its property and casualty insurance segment of 22 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 33 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 11 million (33 reflecting the impact of lower average investment balances. 
 
 Holding Company and Other P C Fees and Related Expenses 
 Summit, a workers compensation insurance subsidiary, collects fees from a small group of unaffiliated insurers for providing underwriting, policy administration and claims services. In addition, certain of AFG s property and casualty insurance businesses collect fees from customers for ancillary services such as workplace safety programs and premium financing. In the first nine months of 2024, AFG collected 72 million in fees for these services compared to 68 million in the first nine months of 2023. Management views this fee income, net of the 45 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 43 million in the first nine months of 2023 in expenses incurred to generate such fees, as a reduction in the cost of underwriting its property and casualty insurance policies. In addition, AFG s property and casualty insurance businesses earned 11 million and 15 million during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, in fees as compensation for providing services related to the administration of crop insurance business generated by CRS for its former owner prior to the acquisition date. The expenses related to providing such services are embedded in property and casualty underwriting expenses. Consistent with internal management reporting, these fees and the related expenses are netted and recorded as a reduction of commissions and other underwriting expenses in AFG s segmented results. 
 
 Holding Company and Other Other Income 
 Other income in the table above includes 9 million and 12 million in the first nine months of 2024 and the first nine months of 2023, respectively, in management fees paid to AFG by the AFG-managed CLOs (AFG s consolidated managed investment entities). The management fees are eliminated in consolidation see the other income line in the Consolidate MIEs column under Results of Operations Segmented Statement of Earnings. Excluding amounts eliminated in consolidation, AFG recorded other income outside of its property and casualty insurance segment of 3 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 4 million in the first nine months of 2023, a decrease of 1 million (25 ).

 Holding Company and Other Gain on Retirement of Debt 
 During the first nine months of 2023, AFG repurchased 23 million principal amount of its senior notes, which resulted in a 2 million pretax non-core gain and recorded a 1 million pretax non-core loss related to the write-off of debt issue costs associated with its previous revolving credit facility, which was replaced in June 2023. 
 
 Realized Gains (Losses) on Securities 
 AFG s realized gains (losses) on securities were net gains of 10 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to net losses of 67 million in the first nine months of 2023, a change of 77 million (115 ). Realized gains (losses) on securities consisted of the following (in millions): 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Realized gains (losses) before impairment allowances: Disposals (4) (31) Change in the fair value of equity securities 29 (23) Change in the fair value of derivatives 2 (4) 27 (58) Change in allowance for impairments on securities (17) (9) Realized gains (losses) on securities 10 (67) 
 The 31 million net realized loss from disposals in the first nine months of 2023 includes losses of 15 million from the sale of investments in banks and 5 million from the sale of municipal bonds. 
 
 The 29 million net realized gain from the change in the fair value of equity securities in the first nine months of 2024 includes gains of 19 million on investments in banks and financing companies, 5 million on investments in natural gas companies and 5 million on investments in healthcare companies. The 23 million net realized loss from the change in the fair value of equity securities in the first nine months of 2023 includes losses of 13 million on investments in media companies, 8 million on investments in banks and financing companies, 8 million on investments in healthcare companies and 3 million on investments in energy companies, partially offset by gains of 3 million on investments in capital goods companies and 3 million on investments in natural gas companies. 
 
 The 17 million change in allowance for impairments on securities in the first nine months of 2024 relates primarily to an allowance taken on corporate bonds from a single issuer in the financial sector.

 During the third quarter of 2023, AFG recorded a realized loss on subsidiary of 4 million, consisting of a 26 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a 22 million reduction in the fair value contingent consideration liability, both related to AFG s investment in Verikai. 
 
 Consolidated Income Taxes 
 AFG s consolidated provision for income taxes was 172 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 149 million for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 23 million (15 ). See Note K Income Taxes to the financial statements for an analysis of items affecting AFG s effective tax rate. 

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED 
 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07 ASU 2023-07 ), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . ASU 2023-07 will require enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and a description of the composition of other segment expenses by business segment. ASU 2023-07 also requires disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a retrospective basis. As of September 30, 2024, AFG has not adopted ASU 2023-07. Management is evaluating the impact of the standard to the segment reporting disclosures. Since ASU 2023-07 only requires additional disclosure, the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on AFG s results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 ASU 2023-09 ), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . ASU 2023-09 is intended to improve income tax disclosures by requiring (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation presented in both dollar and percentage terms; (ii) the disaggregation of income taxes paid (net of refunds received), income (loss) before income taxes and income taxes by jurisdiction (federal, state and foreign taxes); and (iii) further disaggregation of income taxes paid by any individual jurisdiction equal to or exceeding five percent of total income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and is required to be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. As of September 30, 2024, AFG has not adopted ASU 2023-09. Management is evaluating the impact of the standard to the income tax disclosures. Since ASU 2023-09 only requires additional disclosure, the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on AFG s results of operations or financial condition. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the information provided in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of AFG s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Consistent with the discussion in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis Investments, the following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the fair value of AFG s fixed maturity portfolio to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on AFG s fixed maturity portfolio that an immediate increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at September 30, 2024 (based on the duration of the portfolio, dollars in millions). Effects of increases or decreases from the 100 basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 AFG s management, with participation of its Co-Chief Executive Officers and its Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated AFG s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, AFG s Co-CEOs and CFO concluded that the controls and procedures are effective. There have been no changes in AFG s internal control over financial reporting during the third fiscal quarter of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AFG s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, AFG and its subsidiaries routinely enhance their information systems by either upgrading current systems or implementing new systems. There have been no changes in AFG s business processes and procedures during the third fiscal quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AFG s internal control over financial reporting.
