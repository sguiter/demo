The Company's effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 principally due to subpart F income (i.e., global intangible low-taxed income, or "GILTI," earned by the Company's foreign subsidiaries), foreign income tax rate differentials, state and local taxes, changes in the Company's uncertain tax positions, the excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and certain other permanent items.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Annual Report, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in ITEM 7 of Part II of the 2023 Annual Report, and the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Report. Unless otherwise noted, all of the financial information in this Report is consolidated financial information for the Company. The forward-looking statements in this discussion regarding the mattress and pillow industries, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" elsewhere in this Report and in the 2023 Annual Report, the section titled "Risk Factors" contained in ITEM 1A of Part I of the 2023 Annual Report and in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in the section titled Risk Factors contained in ITEM 1A of Part II for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
 
 In this discussion and analysis, we discuss and explain the consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, including the following topics: 
 
 an overview of our business and strategy; 
 results of operations, including our net sales and costs in the periods presented as well as changes between periods; 
 expected sources of liquidity for future operations; and 
 our use of certain non-GAAP financial measures. 

Business Overview 
 
 General 
 
 We are committed to improving the sleep of more people, every night, all around the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer, distributor and retailer of bedding products, we know how crucial a good night of sleep is to overall health and wellness. Utilizing over a century of knowledge and industry-leading innovation, we deliver award-winning products that provide breakthrough sleep solutions to consumers in over 100 countries. 
 
 We operate in two segments: North America and International. These segments are strategic business units that are managed separately based on geography. Our North America segment consists of manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries and licensees located in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Our International segment consists of manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensees located in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America (other than Mexico). Corporate operating expenses are not included in either of the segments and are presented separately as a reconciling item to consolidated results. We evaluate segment performance based on net sales, gross profit and operating income. For additional information refer to Note 11, "Business Segment Information," included in Part I, ITEM 1 of this Report. 
 
 Our highly recognized brands include Tempur-Pedic , Sealy and Stearns Foster and our non-branded offerings consist of value-focused private label and OEM products. Our products allow for complementary merchandising strategies and are sold through third-party retailers, our more than 750 company-owned and joint venture operated retail stores worldwide and our e-commerce channel. 
 
 Our distribution model operates through an omni-channel strategy. We distribute through two channels in each operating business segment: Wholesale and Direct. Our Wholesale channel consists of third-party retailers, including third-party distribution, hospitality and healthcare. Our Direct channel includes company-owned stores, online and call centers. 
 
 General Business and Economic Conditions 
 
 We believe the bedding industry is structured for sustained growth over the long term, driven by product innovation, sleep technology advancements, consumer confidence, housing formations and population growth. The industry is no longer engaged in uneconomical retail store expansion, startups have shifted from uneconomical strategies to becoming profitable and legacy retailers and manufacturers have become skilled in producing profitable online sales. 
 
 Over the last decade, consumers have made the connection between a good night's sleep and overall health and wellness. As consumers make this connection, they are willing to invest more in their bedding purchases, which positions us well for long-term growth.

Table of Contents 

 In the remainder of 2024, we expect a continuation of the current macroeconomic environment, which includes the impact of inflation and interest rate pressures on the consumer. These macroeconomic pressures on the consumer continue to challenge the global bedding industry. Ongoing geopolitical conflicts may also introduce further uncertainty for the consumer. We expect to outperform the bedding industry, amid these macroeconomic headwinds, as a result of our successful new product launches and recent distribution gains in the U.S. 

Definitive Agreement with Mattress Firm. 
 
 On May 9, 2023, Tempur Sealy International and Mattress Firm entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") for a pending business acquisition in which Tempur Sealy International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, will acquire Mattress Firm in a transaction valued at approximately 4.0 billion. The transaction is expected to be funded by approximately 2.7 billion of cash consideration and the issuance of 34.2 million shares of common stock, resulting in a total stock consideration value of 1.3 billion based on a closing share price of 37.62 as of May 8, 2023. 
 
 On July 2, 2024, the FTC filed a complaint for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (the "Court") and an administrative complaint (together with the complaint filed with the Court, the "Actions") to challenge our proposed acquisition of Mattress Firm. On October 4, 2024, the Company filed a complaint in the Court seeking an injunction against the FTC's administrative proceeding. Refer to Note 8, "Commitments and Contingencies" in the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements," under Part I, ITEM 1 of this Report for further details. 
 
 On September 23, 2024, we announced that we entered into a purchase agreement with MW SO Holdings Company, LLC Mattress Warehouse ), a leading independently owned bedding specialty retailer, for the sale of 73 Mattress Firm retail locations and our Sleep Outfitters subsidiary, which includes 103 specialty mattress retail locations and seven distribution centers. Mattress Warehouse is a multi-branded retailer offering a full array of mattresses at various price points. We will continue to supply our Tempur-Pedic , Stearns Foster and Sealy products to the divested Mattress Firm and Sleep Outfitters stores. The divestiture is subject to the closing of our acquisition of Mattress Firm and other customary closing conditions. It is expected to close approximately one quarter after the closing of the Mattress Firm transaction. 
 
 We continue to believe that a successful litigation process can be completed in the coming months, which would allow the transaction to close in late 2024 or early 2025. Following the close of the transaction, Mattress Firm is expected to operate as a separate business unit. 
 
 Product Launches 
 
 In 2024, we completed the launch of a new portfolio of Tempur-Pedic Adapt mattresses in our North America segment. This next-generation technology sets the standard for support, pressure relief and motion cancellation with Tempur material precisely responding to your body's weight, shape and temperature in a way no other mattress does. This collection was designed to complement the Tempur-Pedic Breeze collection and Tempur-Ergo Smart Bases launched in 2023 and finishes the complete reset of our core Tempur lineup. 
 
 In our International segment in 2024, we completed the rollout of the new line of Tempur products in over 90 markets through our wholly-owned subsidiaries and third-party distributors. This new line of products will broaden Tempur 's price range with the super-premium price point ceiling maintained and the floor expanded into the premium category to broaden our global addressable market. 
 
 In 2025, we will launch an all-new collection of Sealy Posturepedic products. This is a significant re-imagining of the Posturepedic collection and will feature new proprietary coil technology, a new aesthetic and an updated merchandising strategy.

 Gross margin was 45.4 as compared to 44.9 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, was 46.2 as compared to 45.9 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Operating income increased 10.2 to 201.8 million as compared to 183.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 4.2 to 223.7 million as compared to 214.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Net income increased 14.7 to 130.0 million as compared to 113.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 7.1 to 146.5 million as compared to 136.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Earnings per diluted share ("EPS") increased 14.1 to 0.73 as compared to 0.64 in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EPS, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 6.5 to 0.82 as compared to 0.77 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 For a discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures as discussed above to the corresponding GAAP financial results, refer to the non-GAAP financial information set forth below under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Information." 
 
 We may refer to net sales, earnings or other historical financial information on a "constant currency basis," which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These references to constant currency basis do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. To provide information on a constant currency basis, the applicable financial results are adjusted based on a simple mathematical model that translates current period results in local currency using the comparable prior corresponding period's currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local country currency. This information is provided so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Constant currency information is not recognized under GAAP, and it is not intended as an alternative to GAAP measures. Refer to Part I, ITEM 3 of this Report for a discussion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk.

 NET SALES 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) Consolidated North America International Net sales by channel Wholesale 981.8 974.6 878.4 885.1 103.4 89.5 Direct 318.2 302.5 136.9 138.6 181.3 163.9 Total net sales 1,300.0 1,277.1 1,015.3 1,023.7 284.7 253.4 
 
 Net sales increased 1.8 , and on a constant currency basis increased 1.7 . The change in net sales was driven by the following: 
 
 North America net sales decreased 8.4 million, or 0.8 , primarily driven by continued macroeconomic pressures impacting U.S. consumer behavior. Net sales in the Wholesale channel decreased 6.7 million, or 0.8 . Net sales in the Direct channel decreased 1.7 million, or 1.2 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 International net sales increased 31.3 million, or 12.4 , primarily driven by the success of new product launches. On a constant currency basis, International net sales increased 10.5 . Net sales in the Wholesale channel increased 14.6 on a constant currency basis. Net sales in the Direct channel increased 8.2 on a constant currency basis. 

GROSS PROFIT 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in millions, except percentages) Gross Profit Gross Margin Gross Profit Gross Margin Margin Change North America 426.7 42.0 430.4 42.0 International 163.2 57.3 143.3 56.6 0.7 Consolidated gross margin 589.9 45.4 573.7 44.9 0.5 
 
 Costs associated with net sales are recorded in cost of sales and include the costs of producing, shipping, warehousing, receiving and inspecting goods during the period, as well as depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets used in the manufacturing process. 
 
 Our gross margin is primarily impacted by the relative amount of net sales contributed by our premium or value products. Our value products have a significantly lower gross margin than our premium products. If sales of our value priced products increase relative to sales of our premium priced products, our gross margins will be negatively impacted in both our North America and International segments. 
 
 Our gross margin is also impacted by fixed cost leverage based on manufacturing unit volumes; the cost of raw materials; operational efficiencies due to the utilization in our manufacturing facilities; product, brand, channel and country mix; foreign exchange fluctuations; volume incentives offered to certain retail accounts; participation in our retail cooperative advertising programs; and costs associated with new product introductions. Future changes in raw material prices could have a significant impact on our gross margin. Our margins are also impacted by the growth in our Wholesale channel as sales in our Wholesale channel are at wholesale prices, whereas sales in our Direct channel are at retail prices. 
 
 Gross margin improved 50 basis points. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin by segment are discussed below: 
 
 North America gross margin was flat as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The factors impacting gross margin were primarily driven by the unfavorable mix of new OEM distribution of 150 basis points, offset by favorable commodity costs of 80 basis points and operational efficiencies. 
 
 International gross margin improved 70 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by operational efficiencies of 60 basis points.

 Operating expenses increased 16.6 million, or 1.5 , and increased 70 basis points as a percentage of net sales. The primary drivers of changes in operating expenses by segment are explained below: 
 
 North America operating expenses increased 9.0 million, or 1.3 , and increased 80 basis points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by investments in growth initiatives and incremental bad debt expense related to retailer bankruptcies, offset by decreases in advertising. 
 
 International operating expenses increased 16.2 million, or 4.9 , and increased 30 basis points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by investments in growth initiatives. 
 
 Corporate operating expenses decreased 8.6 million, or 6.2 . The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by decreased variable compensation expense. 
 
 Research and development expenses were 22.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 23.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an decrease of 0.2 million, or 0.9 .

 Operating income increased 21.3 million and operating margin improved 70 basis points. The primary drivers of changes in operating income and operating margin by segment are discussed below: 
 
 North America operating income increased 2.5 million and operating margin improved 50 basis points. The improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by the improvement in gross margin of 130 basis points, partially offset by operating expense deleverage of 80 basis points. 
 
 International operating income increased 10.2 million and operating margin improved 60 basis points. The improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by the improvement in gross margin of 130 basis points, partially offset by operating expense deleverage of 30 basis points and Asia joint venture performance. 
 
 Corporate operating expenses decreased 8.6 million, which positively impacted our consolidated operating margin.

 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Interest expense, net 98.5 99.0 (0.5) 
 
 Interest expense, net, decreased 0.5 million, or 0.5 . The decrease in interest expense, net, was primarily driven by reduced average levels of outstanding variable rate debt. 

INCOME TAX PROVISION Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Income tax provision 95.5 93.5 2.1 Effective tax rate 23.4 24.3 
 
 Our income tax provision increased 2.0 million driven by an increase in income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year declined 90 basis points. The effective tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included the net favorable impact of the deductibility of stock compensation in the U.S., which was offset by the unfavorable impact of discrete items. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations, supplemented with borrowings in the capital markets and made pursuant to our credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents on hand. Principal uses of funds consist of payments of principal and interest on our debt facilities, acquisitions, payments of dividends to our shareholders, capital expenditures and working capital needs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had net working capital of 143.5 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 104.2 million, as compared to a working capital of 195.0 million, including cash and cash equivalents of 74.9 million, as of December 31, 2023. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside of the U.S. and not readily convertible into the U.S. Dollar or other major foreign currencies is not material to our overall liquidity or financial position. 
 
 Cash Provided by (Used in) Operations 
 
 The table below presents net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities from operations for the periods indicated below: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operations: Operating activities 537.4 479.2 Investing activities (75.9) (152.8) Financing activities (435.7) (303.2) 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased 58.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by a 22.3 million increase in non-cash depreciation expense, primarily associated with our new Tempur manufacturing facility, a 20.1 million increase in net income and a 10.6 million increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities decreased 76.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by decreased capital expenditures related to our manufacturing capacity expansion projects in 2023. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities increased 132.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net repayments of 307.3 million on our credit facilities as compared to 198.4 million in the same period in 2023. We paid dividends to shareholders of 70.1 million and 58.8 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we repurchased 43.8 million and 36.0 million of our common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of our long-term incentive plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 Capital expenditures totaled 76.4 million and 153.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We currently expect our 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately 125 million, which includes maintenance capital expenditures of 110 million. 
 
 Indebtedness 
 
 Our total debt decreased to 2,287.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from 2,593.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Total availability under our revolving senior secured credit facility was 1,189.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 4, "Debt" in the "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements," under Part I, ITEM 1 for further discussion of our debt. 
 
 On February 6, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the 2023 Credit Agreement which provides for a 625.0 million delayed draw term loan and a 40.0 million increase in availability on the existing revolving loan. Once drawn, the instruments will have the same terms and conditions as the Company's existing term loans and revolving loans, respectively, under the 2023 Credit Agreement. This amendment was executed in connection with the Company's financing strategy for the pending acquisition of Mattress Firm. 
 
 On October 24, 2024, we entered into an Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") and an Amendment No. 3 ("Amendment No. 3" and together with Amendment No. 2, the "Amendments") to the 2023 Credit Agreement dated as of October 10, 2023, as amended. Amendment No. 2 extends the termination date for 605 million of our existing delayed draw term A loan commitments until October 24, 2025, among other changes. Amendment No. 3 provides for an incremental term B loan in the aggregate principal amount of 1.6 billion (the "Term B Loan"). The proceeds of the Term B Loan were funded into escrow on the closing of Amendment No. 3 and will mature on October 24, 2031. The proceeds of the Term B Loan will be used to pay fees and expenses in connection with Amendment No. 3 and may be released upon the closing of the previously disclosed Mattress Firm acquisition. If the closing of the Mattress Firm acquisition does not occur prior to the first anniversary of the funding date, we will be required to repay the Term B Loan. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our ratio of consolidated indebtedness less netted cash to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in accordance with our 2023 Credit Agreement was 2.41 times. This ratio is within the terms of the financial covenants for the maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio as set forth in the 2023 Credit Agreement, which limits this ratio to 5.00 times. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants in our debt agreements, and we do not anticipate material issues under any debt agreements based on current facts and circumstances. 
 
 Our debt agreements contain certain covenants that limit restricted payments, including share repurchases and dividends. The 2023 Credit Agreement, 2029 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes contain similar limitations which, subject to certain conditions, allow unlimited restricted payments at times when the ratio of consolidated indebtedness less netted cash to adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, remains below 3.75 times in the case of the 2023 Credit Agreement and remains below 3.50 times in the cases of the 2029 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes. In addition, these agreements permit limited restricted payments under certain conditions when the ratio of consolidated indebtedness less netted cash to adjusted EBITDA is above 3.75 times in the case of the 2023 Credit Agreement and above 3.50 times in the cases of the 2029 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes. The limit on restricted payments under the 2023 Credit Agreement, 2029 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes is in part determined by a basket that grows at 50 of adjusted net income each quarter, reduced by restricted payments that are not otherwise permitted. 
 
 For additional information, refer to "Non-GAAP Financial Information" below for the calculation of the ratio of consolidated indebtedness less netted cash to adjusted EBITDA calculated in accordance with the 2023 Credit Agreement. Both consolidated indebtedness and adjusted EBITDA as used in discussion of the 2023 Credit Agreement are non-GAAP financial measures and do not purport to be alternatives to net income as a measure of operating performance or total debt. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 Our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in 2016 pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock, and the Board of Directors has authorized increases to this authorization from time to time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, we had 774.5 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. 
 
 Share repurchases under this program may be made through open market transactions, negotiated purchases or otherwise, at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. These repurchases may be funded by operating cash flows and/or borrowings under our debt arrangements. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, financing and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. The program is subject to certain limitations under our debt agreements. The program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws. 
 
 We will manage our share repurchase program based on current and expected cash flows, share price and alternative investment opportunities. As a result of the pending Mattress Firm acquisition, we have temporarily suspended our repurchase of shares in advance of closing the transaction. For a complete description of our share repurchase program, please refer to ITEM 5 under Part II, "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," in the 2023 Annual Report. Please also refer to "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" in ITEM 2(c) of Part II of this Report. 
 
 Future Liquidity Sources and Uses 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,293.4 million of liquidity, including 104.2 million of cash on hand and 1,189.2 million available under our 2023 Credit Agreement. In addition, we expect to generate cash flow from operations in the full year 2024. We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for our foreseeable working capital needs, necessary capital expenditures, debt service obligations and dividend payments. 
 
 Our capital allocation strategy follows a balanced approach focused on supporting the business, returning shareholder value through strategic acquisition opportunities that enhance our global competitiveness, as well as quarterly dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
 
 The Board of Directors declared a dividend of 0.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024. The dividend is payable on December 5, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 21, 2024. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2,287.8 million in total debt outstanding and consolidated indebtedness less netted cash, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, of 2,183.6 million. Leverage based on the ratio of consolidated indebtedness less netted cash to adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, was 2.41 times for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our debt service obligations could, under certain circumstances, have material consequences to our stockholders. Similarly, our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we may complete may also impact our cash requirements and debt service obligations.

 Non-GAAP Financial Information 
 
 We provide information regarding adjusted net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income (expense), adjusted operating margin, consolidated indebtedness and consolidated indebtedness less netted cash, which are not recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be alternatives to net income, earnings per share, gross profit, gross margin, operating income (expense) and operating margin as a measure of operating performance, or an alternative to total debt as a measure of liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with performance measures that better reflect our underlying operations and trends, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income, gross profit, gross margin, operating income (expense) and operating margin. The adjustments we make to derive the non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments to exclude items that may cause short-term fluctuations in the nearest GAAP financial measure, but which we do not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of our business. 
 
 We believe that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results from operations and trends, and we use these measures along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business, to evaluate our consolidated and business segment performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, to establish operational goals and to provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes. Limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP measures include that these measures do not present all of the amounts associated with our results as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental in nature and should not be construed as more significant than comparable financial measures defined by GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For more information about these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial measure, please refer to the reconciliations on the following pages.
