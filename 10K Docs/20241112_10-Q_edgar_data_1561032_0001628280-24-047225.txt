 Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through the OP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries including taxable REIT subsidiaries. Prior to the consummation of the Internalization (as defined below) on September 27, 2024, the Company s former advisor, Healthcare Trust Advisors, LLC (the Advisor ), managed its day-to-day business with the assistance of its property manager, Healthcare Trust Properties, LLC (the Property Manager ). Prior to the consummation of the Internalization, the Advisor and Property Manager were under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC AR Global or the Advisor Parent ), and these related parties received compensation and fees for providing services to the Company. See the Internalization section in this Note for additional information regarding the Internalization. 
 The Company also reimbursed, and in the case of the Property Manager, continues to reimburse, these entities for certain expenses they incur in providing these services to the Company. Healthcare Trust Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the Special Limited Partner ), which is also under common control with AR Global, also has an interest in the Company through ownership of interests in the OP. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned SHOPs using the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 RIDEA structure in its SHOP segment. Under RIDEA, a REIT may lease qualified healthcare properties on an arm s length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor. 
 The Company operates in reportable business segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: OMFs and SHOPs. All of the Company s properties across both business segments are located throughout the United States. In its OMF operating segment, the Company owns, manages and leases single- and multi-tenant OMFs where tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating expenses, which may be subject to expense exclusions and floors, in addition to base rent. The Property Manager or third-party managers manage the Company s OMFs. In its SHOP segment, the Company invests in seniors housing properties through the RIDEA structure. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had eligible independent contractors operating SHOPs. 
 The Company declared quarterly dividends entirely in shares of its common stock from October 2020 through January 2024. Dividends payable entirely in shares of common stock are treated in a fashion similar to a stock split for accounting purposes specifically related to per-share calculations for the current and prior periods. Since October 2020, the Company has issued an aggregate of approximately million shares as stock dividends (as adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below)). other additional shares of common stock have been issued since October 2020. References made to weighted-average shares and per-share amounts in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the cumulative increase in shares outstanding resulting from the stock dividends since October 2020 and through January 2024, and are noted as such throughout the accompanying financial statements and notes. See Note 8 Stockholders Equity for additional information on the stock dividends. 
 On March 27, 2024, the Company published a new estimate of per-share net asset value Estimated Per-Share NAV as of December 31, 2023. The Estimated Per-Share NAV published on March 27, 2024 has not been adjusted since publication and will not be adjusted until the Company s board of directors (the Board determines a new Estimated Per-Share NAV. Issuing dividends in additional shares of common stock will, all things equal, cause the value of each share to decline because the number of shares outstanding increases when shares of common stock are issued in respect of a stock dividend; however, because each stockholder will receive the same number of new shares, the total value of a common stockholder s investment, all things equal, will not change assuming no sales or other transfers. The Company intends to publish Estimated Per-Share NAV periodically at the discretion of the Board, provided that such estimates will be made at least once annually unless the Company lists its common stock.

 million and (ii) the Advisor Parent received (x) an asset management fee of million, representing the aggregate Base Management Fee (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) that the Company would have been required to pay to the Advisor during the remaining three month notice period required to terminate the Advisory Agreement, and (y) a property management fee of million, representing the aggregate Management Fees (as defined in the Property Management Agreement) that the Company would have been required to pay to the Property Manager through the current term of the Property Management Agreement, in each case, as adjusted to the extent the amount of such asset management and property management fees exceed or are less than the amount required to be paid by the Advisor Parent to employees placed with the Company pursuant to the Internalization prior to the Closing and the amounts due under contracts acquired by the Company in the Internalization relating to the pre-Closing period (collectively, the Closing Payments in an aggregate amount of million). The Advisor Parent also delivered cash to the Company at Closing in order for the Company to pay any unpaid employee bonuses for calendar year 2023 and any accrued bonuses for calendar year 2024 to the extent that the Company has previously reimbursed the Advisor Parent for, but the Advisor Parent has not paid, such bonuses. 
 Pursuant to the Internalization Agreement, because the Closing Payments exceeded the Company s Available Cash (as defined in the Internalization Agreement), the Company paid the Advisor Parent an aggregate cash consideration of million (such cash amount, the Closing Date Cash Consideration ), and the Company issued to the Advisor Parent an unsecured promissory note (the Promissory Note (as further defined in Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in a principal amount of million, equal to the difference between the Closing Date Cash Consideration and the Closing Payments . 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 On September 26, 2024, following approval by the Board and in accordance with Maryland General Corporate Law, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the Company s articles of amendment and restatement (as amended to date, the Charter with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland SDAT to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the common stock ), at a ratio of one-for-four, which became effective on September 30, 2024 (the Reverse Stock Split ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the par value of the common stock adjusted to per share. The number of authorized shares of common stock under the Charter remains unchanged. 
 All share and per share data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 
 Name Change and Common Stock Par Value Adjustment 
 On September 26, 2024, following approval by the Board, the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the Second Charter Amendment to the Company s Charter with the SDAT to (i) change the Company s name to National Healthcare Properties, Inc. from Healthcare Trust, Inc. and (ii) adjust the par value of the Company s common stock back to per share following the Reverse Stock Split, both of which became effective on September 30, 2024.

 years. Rent from tenants in the Company s OMF segment (as discussed below) is recorded in accordance with the terms of each lease on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Because many of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable for, and include in revenue from tenants on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. When the Company acquires a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease modification is executed. The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. Tenant revenue also includes operating expense reimbursements which generally increase with any increase in property operating and maintenance expenses in our OMF segment. In addition to base rent, dependent on the specific lease, tenants are generally required to pay either (i) their pro rata share of property operating and maintenance expenses, which may be subject to expense exclusions and floors, or (ii) their share of increases in property operating and maintenance expenses to the extent they exceed the properties expenses for the base year of the respective leases. Under ASC 842, the Company has elected to report combined lease and non-lease components in a single line Revenue from tenants . For expenses paid directly by the tenant, under both ASC 842 and 840, the Company has reflected them on a net basis.

 properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For acquired properties with leases classified as operating leases, the Company allocates the purchase price to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of the Company s pre-acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed. 
 Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis. The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value. The Company estimates the fair value using data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods. Fair value estimates are also made using significant assumptions such as capitalization rates, fair market lease rates, discount rates and land values per square foot. 
 Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquired leases for above- and below-market lease rates and the value of in-place leases. Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to months. The Company also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. 
 Above-market and below-market lease values for acquired properties are initially recorded based on the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining initial term of the lease for above-market leases and the remaining initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.

 years for buildings, years for land improvements, seven to years for fixtures and improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests. 
 Construction in progress is not depreciated until the project has reached substantial completion. The value of certain other intangibles such as certificates of need in certain jurisdictions are amortized over the expected period of benefit (generally the life of the related building). 
 The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases. 
 The value of customer relationship intangibles, if any, is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense. 
 Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts are amortized as an increase or reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective mortgages. 
 seniors housing properties which are leased and operated through its TRS. The TRS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the OP. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies (including modifying intercompany leases with the TRS) and recent financial operations. In the event the Company determines that it would not be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, the Company establishes a valuation allowance which offsets the previously recognized income tax asset.

Certain expenses have been incurred as a result of the Company s decision to terminate the Advisory Agreement, which are discussed below in the section Internalization Termination Fees . The following describes certain expenses and fees that the Company was obligated to pay under the Advisory Agreement prior to its termination in connection with the Internalization. 
 Acquisition Expense Reimbursements 
 The Advisor was reimbursed for services provided for which it incurred investment-related expenses or insourced expenses. The amount reimbursed for insourced expenses was not permitted to exceed of the contract purchase price of each acquired property or of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment. Additionally, the Company reimbursed the Advisor for third-party acquisition expenses. Under the Advisory Agreement, total acquisition expenses were not permitted to exceed of the contract purchase price of the Company s portfolio or of the amount advanced for all loans or other investments. This threshold was not exceeded through September 27, 2024, the date the Advisory Agreement was terminated.

 cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return thereon (the Economic Hurdle (y) any one of the following occurs: (1) a listing; (2) another liquidity event or (3) the termination of the advisory agreement by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Company s independent directors without cause; and (z) the Advisor is still providing advisory services to the Company (the Performance Condition ). 
 Unvested Class B Units would be forfeited immediately if: (a) the advisory agreement is terminated for any reason other than a termination without cause; or (b) the advisory agreement is terminated by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Company s independent directors without cause before the Economic Hurdle has been met. 
 Subject to approval by the Board, the Class B Units were issued to the Advisor quarterly in arrears pursuant to the terms of the LPA. The number of Class B Units issued in any quarter was equal to: (i) the excess of (A) the product of (y) the cost of assets multiplied by (z) over (B) any amounts payable as an oversight fee (as described below) for such calendar quarter; divided by (ii) the value of one share of common stock as of the last day of such calendar quarter, which was initially equal to (the price in the Company s initial public offering of common stock minus the selling commissions and dealer manager fees). The value of issued Class B Units will be determined and expensed when the Company deems the achievement of the Performance Condition to be probable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that achieving the Performance Condition was not yet considered probable for accounting purposes. The Advisor received cash distributions on each issued Class B Unit equivalent to the cash distribution paid, if any, on the Company s common stock. These cash distributions on Class B Units will be included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss if the Performance Condition is considered probable to occur. The Board has previously approved the issuance of Class B Units to the Advisor in connection with this arrangement. The Board determined in February 2018 that the Economic Hurdle had been satisfied, however, none of the events have occurred, including a listing of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange, which would have satisfied the other vesting requirement of the Class B Units. Therefore, no expense has ever been recognized in connection with the Class B Units. 
 On May 12, 2015, the Company, the OP and the Advisor entered into an amendment to the then-current advisory agreement, which, among other things, provided that the Company would cease causing the OP to issue Class B Units to the Advisor with respect to any period ending after March 31, 2015. In connection with the Internalization, immediately prior to Closing, the Advisor transferred Class B Units to the Advisor Parent. 
 Effective February 17, 2017, the Advisory Agreement required the Company to pay the Advisor a base management fee, which was payable on the first business day of each month. The fixed portion of the base management fee was equal to million per month, while the variable portion of the base management fee was equal to one-twelfth of of the cumulative net proceeds of any equity (including convertible equity and certain convertible debt but excluding proceeds from the DRIP) issued by the Company and its subsidiaries subsequent to February 17, 2017 per month. There were no variable management fees earned from the issuance of common stock dividends. Upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, the Company is no longer obligated to pay the base management fee. 
 In addition, the Advisory Agreement required the Company to pay the Advisor a variable management/incentive fee quarterly in arrears equal to (1) the product of fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding multiplied by (2) (x) of the applicable prior quarter s Core Earnings (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) per share in excess of per share plus (y) of the applicable prior quarter s Core Earnings per share in excess of per share. No incentive fee was incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, the Company is no longer obligated to pay a variable management/incentive fee. 
 In connection with the Internalization, on the Closing Date, the Advisor Parent received an asset management fee of million, representing the aggregate Base Management Fee (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) that the Company would have been required to pay to the Advisor during the six month notice period required to terminate the Advisory Agreement, which began on June 25, 2024 when the Company delivered notice to the Advisor of its intention to effect the Internalization, inclusive of million of Base Management Fees that the Company would have been required to pay to the Advisor during the remaining three month notice period following the Closing Date.

 million and million, respectively, of reimbursement expenses from the Advisor for providing administrative services. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred million and million, respectively, of reimbursement expenses from the Advisor for providing administrative services. These reimbursement expenses are included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Bonus Awards 
 Reimbursements for the cash portion of 2023 bonuses paid by the Advisor to its employees, or employees of its affiliates, were expensed and reimbursed on a monthly basis during the year ended December 31, 2023 in accordance with estimates provided by the Advisor. These amounts were awarded in May 2024 and were scheduled to be paid by the Advisor to its employees from September 2024 to March 2 025. Following the Internalization, pursuant to the Internalization Agreement, the Advisor Parent remitted the unpaid portion of these amounts to the Company, which subsequently paid out such amounts in October 2024 to the employees who joined the Company from the Advisor as part of the Internalization. 
 For the cash portion of 2024 accrued bonuses for the Advisor s employees, or employees of its affiliates, the Company previously reimbursed the Advisor for such amounts in accordance with estimates provided by the Advisor. Following the Internalization, pursuant to the Internalization Agreement, the Advisor Parent remitted such amounts to the Company for subsequent payment to the employees who joined the Company from the Advisor as part of the Internalization. 
 Property Management Fees 
 Unless the Company contracts with a third party, the Company pays the Property Manager a property management fee on a monthly basis, equal to of gross revenues from the Company s stand-alone single-tenant net leased properties managed and of gross revenues from all other types of properties managed, plus market-based leasing commissions applicable to the geographic location of the property. The Company also reimburses the Property Manager for property level expenses incurred by the Property Manager. The Property Manager may charge a separate fee for the one-time initial rent-up or leasing-up of newly constructed properties in an amount not to exceed the fee customarily charged in arm s length transactions by others rendering similar services in the same geographic area for similar properties, and the Property Manager is allowed to receive a higher property management fee in certain cases if approved by the Company s Board (including a majority of the independent directors). 
 On February 17, 2017, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Property Management and Leasing Agreement (the Property Management Agreement with the OP and the Property Manager. The Property Management Agreement automatically renews for successive terms unless any party provides written notice of its intention to terminate the Property Management Agreement. The Company provided the Property Manager with notice of its intent to self-manage in June 2024, and, in connection with the Internalization, the Advisor Parent contributed all its equity interests in the Property Manager to the Company. Following the Closing of the Internalization, the Property Management Agreement remains in place as an intercompany agreement.

After holding the Series A Preferred Units for a period of , a holder of Series A Preferred Units has the right to redeem Series A Preferred Units for, at the option of the OP, the corresponding number of shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock, or the cash equivalent. The remaining rights of the limited partners in the OP are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Series A Preferred Unit holders were paid and million, respectively. 
 Common OP Units 
 The Company is the sole general partner and holds substantially all of the Common OP Units. As of December 31, 2023, the Advisor held partnership units in the OP designated as Common OP Units . In connection with the Internalization, immediately prior to Closing, the Advisor transferred the Common OP Units to the Advisor Parent. As of September 30, 2024, the Advisor Parent held Common OP Units. 
 In November 2014, the Company partially funded the purchase of an OMF from an unaffiliated third party by causing the OP to issue Common OP Units, with a value of million, or per unit, to the unaffiliated third party. 
 A holder of Common OP Units has the right to receive cash distributions equivalent to the cash distributions, if any, on the Company s common stock in an amount retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividends, other stock dividends and other similar events. After holding the Common OP Units for a period of , a holder of Common OP Units has the right to redeem Common OP Units for, at the option of the OP, the corresponding number of shares of the Company s common stock, as retroactively adjusted for the stock dividends, other stock dividends and other similar events, or the cash equivalent. The remaining rights of the limited partners in the OP are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets. Dur ing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , Common OP Unit non-controlling interest holders were t paid any cash distribu tions. 
 Stock dividends do not cause the OP to issue additional Common OP Units, rather, the redemption ratio to common stock is adjusted. The Common OP Units outstanding as of September 30, 2024 would be redeemable for shares of common stock, giving effect to adjustments for the impact of the stock dividends through January 2024 and the Reverse Stock Split. 
 Non-Controlling Interests in Property Owning Subsidiaries 
 The Company also has investment arrangements with other unaffiliated third parties whereby such investors receive an ownership interest in certain of the Company s property-owning subsidiaries and are entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net operating cash flow derived from the subsidiaries property. Upon disposition of a property subject to non-controlling interest, the investor will receive a proportionate share of the net proceeds from the sale of the property. The investor has no recourse to any other assets of the Company. Due to the nature of the Company s involvement with these arrangements and the significance of its investment in relation to the investment of the third party, the Company has determined that it controls each entity in these arrangements and therefore the entities related to these arrangements are consolidated within the Company s financial statements. A non-controlling interest is recorded for the investor s ownership interest in the properties.

 reportable business segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: OMFs and SHOPs. 
 The Company evaluates performance and makes resource allocations based on its business segments. The OMF segment primarily consists of facilities leased to healthcare-related tenants under long-term leases, which may require such tenants to pay a pro rata share of property-related expenses as well as seniors housing properties, hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and skilled nursing facilities under long-term leases, under which tenants are generally responsible to directly pay property-related expenses. The SHOP segment consists of direct investments in seniors housing properties, primarily providing assisted living, independent living and memory care services, which are operated through engaging independent third-party operators. 
 Segment Income 
 The Company evaluates the performance of the combined properties in each segment based on total revenues from tenants, less property operating costs. As such, this excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net loss. The Company uses segment income to assess and compare property level performance and to make decisions concerning the operation of the properties. The Company believes that segment income is useful as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, segment income reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating expenses and acquisition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net loss. 
 Segment income excludes certain components from net loss in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property s results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Segment income presented by the Company may not be comparable to segment income reported by other REITs that define segment income differently.

The operating leases have durations, including assumed renewals, ranging from years to years, excluding an adjacent parking lot lease with a term of years. The Company did not enter into any additional ground leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had ROU assets and liabilities of million and million, re spectively, which are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, respectively, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. In determining operating ROU assets and lease liabilities for the Company s existing operating leases upon the adoption of the lease guidance issued in 2019, as well as for new operating leases in the current period, the Company was required to estimate an appropriate incremental borrowing rate on a fully-collateralized basis for the terms of the leases. Because the terms of the Company s ground leases are significantly longer than the terms of borrowings available to the Company on a fully-collateralized basis, the Company s estimate of this rate required significant judgment. 
 The Company s ground operating leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term, including assumed renewals, of years and a weighted-average discount rate of as of September 30, 2024. For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid cash of million for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities and recorded expense of million on a straight-line basis in accordance with the current accounting guidance. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid cash of million and recorded expense of million. The ground operating lease expense is recorded in property operating expenses in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Prior to consummation of the Internalization on September 27, 2024, our former Advisor managed our day-to-day business with the assistance of our property manager, Healthcare Trust Properties, LLC (the Property Manager ). Prior to the Internalization, the Advisor and Property Manager were under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC (the Advisor Parent and these related parties received compensation and fees for providing services to us. In connection with the Internalization, we internalized our advisory and property management functions with our own dedicated workforce after terminating the Advisory Agreement; the Property Manager became our wholly-owned subsidiary as a result of the Internalization and the Property Management Agreement remains in place as an intercompany agreement (see Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 We operate in two reportable business segments for management and financial reporting purposes: outpatient medical facilities OMFs and senior housing operating properties SHOPs ). All of our properties across both business segments are located throughout the United States. In our OMF operating segment, we own, manage and lease single- and multi-tenant OMFs where tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating expenses, which may be subject to expense exclusions and floors, in addition to base rent. Our Property Manager or third-party managers manage our OMFs. In our SHOP segment, we invest in seniors housing properties through the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 structure. As of September 30, 2024, we had four eligible independent contractors operating 44 SHOPs.

We declared and issued quarterly dividends entirely in shares of our common stock from October 2020 through January 2024. We do not intend to declare any further stock dividends in the future. 
 On March 27, 2024, we published a new Estimated Per-Share NAV equal to 13.00 as of December 31, 2023. The Estimated Per-Share NAV has not been adjusted since publication and will not be adjusted until the Board determines a new Estimated Per-Share NAV. Dividends paid in the form of additional shares of common stock will, all things equal, cause the value of each share of common stock to decline because the number of shares outstanding will increase when dividends paid in stock are issued; however, because each stockholder will receive the same number of new shares, the total value of our common stockholder s investment, all things equal, will not change assuming no sales or other transfers. Since October 2020, we issued an aggregate of approximately 5.2 million shares as stock dividends (as adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below)). No other additional shares of common stock have been issued since October 2020. We intend to publish Estimated Per-Share NAV periodically at the discretion of the Board, provided that such estimates will be made at least once annually unless and until we list our common stock. 
 Internalization 
 On September 27, 2024, we consummated the Internalization after, among other things, terminating the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor. For more information regarding the Internalization, including the fees paid therewith, see Note 1 Organization and Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As a result of the Internalization, our termination of the Advisory Agreement and the Property Manager becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary, we will no longer incur the asset management, property management and other fees and expenses that we were obligated to pay to the Advisor and its affiliates prior to the Internalization. With an internalized workforce, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs for employee compensation and other general and administrative expenses. 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 Effective September 30, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split of our common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every four shares of our issued and outstanding common stock automatically combined and reclassified into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. All share and per share data in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.

Revenue from tenants primarily reflects contractual rent received from tenants in our OMFs and operating expense reimbursements. These reimbursements generally increase in proportion with the increase in property operating and maintenance expenses in our OMF segment. Pursuant to many of our lease agreements in our OMFs, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating and maintenance expenses, which may be subject to expense exclusions and floors, in addition to base rent. 
 Revenue from Tenants 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from tenants decreased by 0.6 million in our OMF segment as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by a 1.3 million decrease in revenue from tenants associated with our Disposed Properties, partially offset by an increase in revenue from tenants of 1.4 million from our Same Store Properties. 
 The increase in our Same Store properties revenue from tenants was primarily due to increased expense reimbursements from higher expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Property Operating and Maintenance 
 Property operating and maintenance expenses reflect the costs associated with our properties, including real estate taxes, utilities, repairs, maintenance and unaffiliated third-party property management fees. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, property operating and maintenance expenses increased by 1.3 million in our OMF segment as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by our Same Store Properties, partially offset by our Disposed Properties. 
 The increase in property operating and maintenance expenses from our Same Store properties was primarily the result of the impacts of inflation on utility and maintenance costs, which were largely reimbursed by tenants.

 ________ 
 (1) Our SHOP segment included 45 Same Store Properties (including one land parcel). 
 (2) Our SHOP segment did not include any Acquired Properties. 
 (3) Our SHOP segment included seven Disposed Properties. 
 (4) Our SHOP segment included 45 total properties (including one land parcel). 
 Revenue from tenants within our SHOP segment are generated in connection with rent and services offered to residents in our SHOPs depending on the level of care required, as well as fees associated with other ancillary services. Property operating and maintenance expenses relate to the costs associated with staffing to provide care for the residents in our SHOPs, as well as food, marketing, real estate taxes, management fees paid to our third-party operators, and costs associated with maintaining the physical site. 
 Revenue from Tenants 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased by 2.6 million in our SHOP segment as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from an increase in revenue from tenants of 3.5 million from our Same Store Properties, partially offset by a 0.9 million decrease in revenue from tenants associated with our Disposed Properties. 
 The increase to our Same Store properties revenue from tenants was primarily driven by higher leasing rates and higher occupancy during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, we offered more rent concessions to drive occupancy during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which amounted t o 1.9 million as compared to 0.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 45 

Property Operating and Maintenance 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, property operating and maintenance expenses increased by 0.8 million in our SHOP segment as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in property operating and maintenance expenses of 1.8 million in our Same Store Properties, partially offset by a decrease of 1.0 million from our Disposed Properties. 
 Our Same Store Properties property operating and maintenance expenses increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from 1.2 million of i ncreased costs for wages, including overtime, training and bonus wages paid to employees of our third party operators, partially offset by decreased costs for contract labor of 0.2 million. 
 Other Results of Operations 
 Impairment Charges 
 We recorded 8.8 million of impairment charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This impairment was recorded to reduce the carrying value of a held-for-use OMF to its estimated fair value . This OMF has been marketed for sale since June 2024 . We did not record any impairment charges in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 See Note 3 Real Estate Investments, Net to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the impairment charges. 
 Operating Fees to Related Parties 
 Prior to the consummation of the Internalization, the Advisor and the Property Manager were paid for asset management and property management services for managing our properties on a day-to-day basis. Operating fees to these related parties were consistent at 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including asset management fees of 5.5 million and property management fees of 0.9 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were no incentive fees incurred in either of the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Following the consummation of the Internalization, we no longer have to pay the above-referenced fees to the related parties, but we will incur expenses related to the compensation and benefits of our officers, employees and consultants, as well as overhead expenses, previously paid by the related parties managing our business and operations, which expenses will be recorded in our general and administrative expenses going forward. 
 See Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which provides detail on our fees and expense reimbursements. 
 Termination Fees to Related Parties 
 We recorded 8.4 million of termination fees to related parties in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of our termination of the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor and transition to self-management through the Internalization. 
 Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses 
 Acquisition and transaction related expenses increased by 5.0 million to 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly due to 4.7 million of advisory, legal and other professional costs and non-recurring employee transition expenses directly related to the Internalization. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 0.7 million to 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which includes 3.0 million and 2.8 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, incurred in expense reimbursements. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also attributable to 0.4 million of employee compensation expenses incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 0.1 million to 20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 20.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain (Loss) on Sale of Real Estate Investments 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we disposed of seven OMFs, one SHOP and one land parcel for an aggregate contract sales price of 79.3 million and recorded an aggregate gain on sale of 1.6 million. These seven OMFs had been previously impaired by 10.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 46 

During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we did not dispose of any properties. However, we did record a loss on sale of 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to various settlements of liens and accruals on formerly disposed properties. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 2.3 million to 18.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to higher average balances of our indebtedness during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding debt obligations were 1.2 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 5.61 per year. As of September 30, 2023, we had total borrowings of 1.2 billion, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49 per year. The weighted-average interest rates include the impact of our pay-fixed interest rate swaps which are designated as hedges on a portion of our variable-rate borrowings. 
 Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings and the cost of borrowings, among other factors (including the impact of variable rates to the extent such borrowings are not hedged). Continued high interest rates may adversely impact the terms on which we may borrow in the future and thus our results of operations. 
 Interest and Other Income 
 Interest and other income includes income from our investment securities and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held during the period. Interest and other income was approximately 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Interest and other income increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to 0.4 million of excess insurance reimbursement, as well as higher interest rates on, and balances of, our cash accounts. 
 Gain (loss) on Non-Designated Derivatives 
 The gain (loss) in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 on non-designated derivative instruments related to interest rate caps that are designed to protect us from adverse interest rate changes in connection with our credit facilities, which have floating interest rates. The relevant amounts in each period represent the change in value and any cash received on the non-designated derivatives. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income taxes generally relate to our SHOPs, which are leased to our TRS. We recorded an income tax expense of approximately nil and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Because of our TRS s recent operating history of losses and the adverse economic impacts from increases in the rate of inflation in recent years on the results of operations of our SHOP assets, we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not we will realize the future benefit of our deferred tax assets; thus we have recorded a 100 valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets through September 30, 2024. If and when we believe it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets, we will reverse the valuation allowance as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
 Allocation for Preferred Stock Distributions 
 Allocation for preferred stock was 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These amounts represent the allocation of our net loss that is attributable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

 Revenue from Tenants 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from tenants increased by 2.4 million in our OMF segment as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from tenants of 2.0 million from our Same Store Properties and 1.8 million from our Acquisition Properties, partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease in revenue from tenants associated with our Disposed Properties. 
 The increase in our Same Store Properties revenue from tenants was primarily driven by an increase of operating expense reimbursement revenue from increased property, operating and maintenance expenses, as well as from higher occupancy in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Property Operating and Maintenance

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, property operating and maintenance costs in our OMF segment increased by 2.3 million as compared to the same period last year, primarily as a result of increased costs from our Same Store Properties of 2.9 million and our Acquired Properties of 0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease from our Disposed Properties of 0.8 million. 
 The increase in property operating and maintenance expenses from our Same Store properties is primarily the result of the impacts of inflation on utility and maintenance costs, which are largely reimbursed by tenants.

 _______________ 
 (1) Our SHOP segment included 45 Same Store Properties (including one land parcel). 
 (2) Our SHOP segment did not include any Acquired Properties. 
 (3) Our SHOP segment included seven Disposed Properties. 
 (4) Our SHOP segment included 45 total properties (including one land parcel). 
 Revenues from tenants within our SHOP segment are generated in connection with rent and services offered to residents in our SHOPs depending on the level of care required, as well as fees associated with other ancillary services. Property operating and maintenance expenses relate to the costs associated with staffing to provide care for the residents in our SHOPs, as well as food, marketing, real estate taxes, management fees paid to our third-party operators, and costs associated with maintaining the physical site. 
 Revenue from Tenants 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from tenants increased by 4.5 million in our SHOP segment as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily from an increase in revenue from tenants of 8.0 million for our Same Store Properties, partially offset by a 3.5 million decrease in revenue from tenants associated with our Disposed Properties. 
 The increase to our Same Store properties revenue from tenants was primarily driven by higher leasing rates and higher occupancy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were partially offset by 3.2 million of increased rent concessions offered to drive occupancy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Property Operating and Maintenance 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, property operating and maintenance expenses increased by 2.5 million in our SHOP segment as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in property operating and maintenance expenses of 6.1 million from our Same Store Properties, partially offset by a decrease of 3.7 million from our Disposed Properties. 
 Our Same Store properties operating and maintenance expenses increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, primarily from (i) 4.6 million of increased costs for overtime, training and bonus wages paid to employees of our third party operators, (ii) 0.5 million of increased management fees paid to our third party operators, (iii) 1.2 million of higher insurance expense and (iv) the effects of inflation which raised the general costs of food, supplies and utilities generally. These increases to property operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by decreased costs for contract labor of 0.6 million. 
 Other Results of Operations 
 Impairment Charges 
 We recorded 11.5 million of impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on two held-for-use OMFs and one SHOP which was disposed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Two held-for-use OMFs were impaired by 11.2 million and the disposed SHOP was impaired by 0.3 million. We did not record any impairment charges during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 See Note 3 Real Estate Investments, Net to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Operating Fees to Related Parties 
 Prior to the consummation of the Internalization, the Advisor and Property Manager were paid for asset management and property management services for managing our properties on a day-to-day basis. Operating fees to these related parties were consistent at 19.2 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, including asset management fees of 16.4 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and property management fees of 2.8 million and 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were no incentive fees incurred in either of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 See Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which provides detail on our fees and expense reimbursements. 
 Termination Fees to Related Parties 
 We recorded 106.7 million of termination fees to related parties in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of our termination of the Advisory Agreement with the Advisor and transition to self-management through the Internalization. 
 Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses 
 Acquisition and transaction related expenses increased by 5.3 million, to 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to 4.7 million of advisory, legal and other professional costs and non-recurring employee transition expenses directly related to the Internalization. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 2.8 million to 16.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which includes 10.0 million and 7.6 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, incurred in expense reimbursements. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to certain severance and other compensation reimbursement payments incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 made to the Advisor prior to the Internalization, as well as 0.4 million of employee compensation expenses incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by 1.9 million to 63.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 61.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gain (Loss) on Sale of Real Estate Investments 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we disposed of seven OMFs, two SHOPs and one land parcel for an aggregate contract sales price of 82.6 million and recorded an aggregate gain on sale of 1.4 million. One of the SHOPs was impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 0.3 million, and had been previously impaired by a cumulative total of 2.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The seven OMFs had been previously impaired by 10.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we disposed of four SHOPs and one OMF for an aggregate contract sales price of 13.8 million. Two of the four disposed SHOPs were previously impaired by 15.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. These dispositions resulted in an aggregate loss on sale of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased by 1.9 million to 52.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 50.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was mainly due to higher average balances of amounts outstanding under our indebtedness during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding debt obligations were 1.2 billion, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.61 per year. As of September 30, 2023, we had total borrowings of 1.2 billion, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.49 per year. The weighted-average interest rates include the impact of our pay-fixed interest rate swaps which are designated as hedges on a portion of our variable-rate borrowings. 
 Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings and the cost of borrowings, among other factors (including the impact of variable rates to the extent such borrowings are not hedged). Continued high interest rates may adversely impact the terms on which we may borrow in the future and thus our results of operations. 
 51 

Interest and Other Income 
 Interest and other income includes income from our investment securities and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held during the period. Interest and other income was approximately 1.1 million and 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest and other income increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to 0.4 million of excess insurance reimbursement, as well as higher interest rates on, and balances of, our cash accounts. 
 Gain on Non-Designated Derivatives 
 Gain on non-designated derivative instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to interest rate caps that are designed to protect us from adverse interest rate changes in connection with the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities, which have floating interest rates. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income taxes generally relate to our SHOPs, which are leased to our TRS. We recorded an income tax expense of approximately 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Because of our TRS s recent operating history of losses and the adverse economic impacts from increases in the rate of inflation in recent years on the results of operations of our SHOP assets, we are not able to conclude that it is more likely than not we will realize the future benefit of our deferred tax assets; thus we have recorded a 100 valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets through September 30, 2024. If and when we believe it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets, we will reverse the valuation allowance as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
 Allocation for Preferred Stock 
 Allocation for preferred stock was 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These amounts represent the allocation of our net loss that is attributable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our existing principal demands for cash are to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, the payment of our operating and administrative expenses, debt service obligations (including principal repayment), the repayment of the Promissory Note (as discussed below) and distributions to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. We closely monitor our current and anticipated liquidity position relative to our current and anticipated demands for cash and believe that we have sufficient current liquidity to meet our financial obligations for at least the next twelve months. Our future liquidity requirements and available liquidity, however, depend on many factors, such as recent and continuing increases in inflation, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and higher property insurance, property tax and interest rates, all of which have and may continue to have adverse impacts on our results of operations and thus ultimately our liquidity. Moreover, these adverse impacts, as well as the ongoing wars in Ukraine, Israel and related sanctions, may also impact our tenant and residents ability to pay rent and thus our cash flows. 
 We expect to fund our future short-term operating liquidity requirements, including distributions to holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, through a combination of current cash on hand, net cash provided by our operating activities, potential future advances under our Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities and OMF Warehouse Facility, net cash provided by our property dispositions (as discussed below) and potential new financings utilizing certain of our currently unencumbered properties. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 32.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. The Barclays OMF Loan Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum balance of cash and cash equivalents of 12.5 million at all times. 
 Internalization and the Promissory Note 
 Pursuant to the merger agreement dated August 6, 2024 (the Internalization Agreement effecting the Internalization, (i) the outstanding membership interests of the Advisor were converted into the right to receive from us an internalization fee of 98.2 million and (ii) the Advisor Parent received (x) an asset management fee of 5.5 million, representing the aggregate Base Management Fee (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) that we would have been required to pay to the Advisor during the remaining three month notice period required to terminate the Advisory Agreement, and (y) a property management fee of 2.9 million, representing the aggregate Management Fees (as defined in the Property Management Agreement) that we would have been required to pay to the Property Manager through the current term of the Property Management Agreement, subject to certain other adjustments (collectively, the Closing Payments in an aggregate amount of 106.6 million). For more information regarding the Internalization, including the fees paid therewith, see Note 1 Organization and Note 9 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 54 

Because the Closing Payments exceeded our Available Cash (as defined in the Internalization Agreement), we paid the Advisor Parent aggregate cash consideration of 75.0 million (such cash amount, the Closing Date Cash Consideration ), and the Company issued to the Advisor Parent an unsecured promissory note (the Promissory Note in a principal amount of 30.3 million, equal to the difference between the Closing Date Cash Consideration and the Closing Payments . The Promissory Note is a senior unsecured obligation and ranks equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future indebtedness. The Promissory Note bears interest per annum of Term SOFR (as defined in the Promissory Note) plus 1.25 until January 1, 2025 and Term SOFR plus 3.25 on and after January 1, 2025, with such interest payable monthly. Beginning on January 2, 2025, we will be required to make monthly payments of principal to the extent of our available cash existing on the applicable payment date. The Promissory Note matures on June 28, 2025 and may be prepaid, in whole or in part, prior to the maturity date without any pre-payment penalties. As of September 30, 2024, the full principal amount under the Promissory Note was outstanding. 
 Following the Internalization, we are no longer required to pay asset management and property management fees to the Advisor Parent. We paid total asset management fees of 5.5 million and 16.4 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and total property management fees, including capitalized leasing commissions, of 1.1 million and 3.6 million, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, exclusive of the asset management fee and property management fee paid to the Advisor Parent as part of the Closing Payments discussed above. 
 Financings 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total debt leverage ratio (total debt divided by total gross asset value) was approximately 46.1 . Net debt totaled 1.2 billion, which represents gross debt 1.2 billion) less cash and cash equivalents 32.9 million). Gross asset value totaled 2.5 billion, which represents total real estate investments, at cost 2.5 billion) net of gross market lease intangible liabilities 23.5 million). Cumulative impairment charges are reflected within gross asset value. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total gross borrowings of 1.2 billion, at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.61 and a weighted-average remaining term of 4.4 years. The weighted-average interest rate includes the impact of pay-fixed swaps that are designated as hedging instruments on a portion of our variable-rate debt, but does not include the impact of our non-designated interest rate caps (discussed below). Inclusive of our non-designated interest rate caps, the weighted-average economic interest rate on our total gross borrowings was 5.01 as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our real estate investments, at cost was 2.5 billion, with 1.3 billion of this asset value pledged as collateral for mortgage notes payable and 650.4 million of this asset value pledged to secure advances under our credit facilities. These real estate assets are not available to satisfy other debts and obligations, or to serve as collateral with respect to new indebtedness, as applicable, unless the existing indebtedness associated with the property is satisfied or the property is removed from the borrowing base of the credit facilities, which would impact availability thereunder. 
 Unencumbered real estate investments, at cost as of September 30, 2024 was 523.4 million. There can be no assurance as to the amount of liquidity we would be able to generate from leveraging these unencumbered real estate investments, if we are able to leverage them at all. 
 Mortgage Notes Payable 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 828.0 million in mortgage notes payable outstanding, all of which is either fixed-rate or effectively fixed through our interest rate swap at a weighted-average annual interest rate of 4.60 and a weighted-average remaining term of 5.4 years. Future scheduled principal payments on our mortgage notes payable for the remainder of 2024 and 2025 are 0.3 million and 13.3 million, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into the BMO CPC Mortgage Loan in connection with a four-property acquisition also completed in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The mortgage has a principal balance of 7.5 million, bears interest at an annual fixed rate of 6.84 and matures in February 2034 with no principal amounts due until that time. 
 Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, 363.7 million was outstanding under our credit facilities, which bore interest at a weighted-average annual rate of 7.91 and had a weighted-average remaining term of 2.1 years. Inclusive of our non-designated interest rate caps, the weighted-average economic interest rate on our credit facilities was 5.94 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2024, 342.0 million was outstanding under our Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities which bore interest at a weighted-average annual rate of 7.89 . Inclusive of our non-designated interest rate caps, the weighted-average economic interest rate on the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities was 5.90 as of September 30, 2024. 
 55 

We may request future advances under the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities by adding eligible properties to the collateral pool subject to customary conditions, including satisfaction of minimum debt service coverage and maximum loan-to-value tests. We do not expect to draw any further amounts on the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities bear annual interest at a rate that varies on a monthly basis and is equal to the sum of the current SOFR for one month U.S. dollar-denominated deposits and a spread (2.41 and 2.46 for the Capital One Facility and the KeyBank Facility, respectively) with a combined floor of 2.62 . The Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities mature on November 1, 2026. Future scheduled principal payments on our Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities for the remainder of 2024 and 2025 are 1.4 million and 5.8 million, respectively. 
 In the year ended December 31, 2023, we provided cash deposits totaling 11.8 million to Fannie Mae because the debt service coverage ratios of the underlying properties of each facility were below the minimum required amounts per the debt agreements. We provided an additional deposit of 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, bringing the total deposit to 12.1 million as of September 30, 2024. These deposits are recorded as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet and are pledged as additional collateral for the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities. These deposits will be refunded upon the earlier of the our achievement of a debt service coverage ratio above the minimum required amount of 1.40 or the maturity of the Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities. 
 OMF Warehouse Facility 
 On December 22, 2023, we entered into a loan agreement with Capital One to provide up to 50.0 million of variable-rate financing. As of September 30, 2024, 21.7 million was outstanding under the OMF Warehouse Facility which bore interest at an annual rate of 8.20 . Inclusive of our non-designated interest rate caps, the economic interest rate on our OMF Warehouse Facility was 6.50 as of September 30, 2024. 
 We may request future advances under the OMF Warehouse Facility by adding eligible OMFs to the collateral pool subject to customary conditions, including satisfaction of minimum debt service coverage and maximum loan-to-value tests. Borrowings under the OMF Warehouse Facility bear interest at a monthly rate equal to the sum of the current SOFR for one-month denominated deposits and a spread of 3.0 . Interest payments are due monthly, with no principal payments due until maturity in December 2026. 
 Non-Designated Interest Rate Caps 
 Our interest rate caps are used to limit our exposure to interest rate movements on our Fannie Mae Master Credit Facilities for economic purposes, however, we do not elect to apply hedge accounting to these instruments. As of September 30, 2024, we had eight SOFR-based interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of 369.2 million, which limits one-month SOFR to 3.50 and have varying maturities through January 2027. Although these interest rate caps are not designated hedging instruments, we consider them economically related to our variable-rate credit facility borrowings. 
 As SOFR has increased beyond 3.50 , we received cash payments of 5.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We received 3.9 million of cash payments in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We paid total premiums of 1.7 million to renew one cap with an aggregate notional amount of 58.1 million which matures in April 2024, and to execute a new cap of 7.0 million, which matures in January 2027. We have five interest rate caps with a notional amount of 289.4 million which mature in 2025, which represents the next maturing interest rate caps. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we paid premiums of 10.0 million to renew expiring interest rate cap contracts. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our capital expenditures were 16.4 million, of which 6.1 million related to our OMF segment and 10.3 million related to our SHOP segment. We anticipate this rate of capital expenditures for the OMF and SHOP segments throughout the remainder of 2024. 
 Acquisitions Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired four single-tenant OMFs for an aggregate contract purchase price of 12.6 million. These acquisitions were funded with 7.5 million of new mortgage debt from our BMO CPC Mortgage Loan and the remainder with cash on hand. 
 Acquisitions Subsequent to September 30, 2024 
 We have not acquired any properties subsequent to September 30, 2024. 
 Dispositions Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 We disposed of seven OMFs, two SHOPs and one land parcel during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for an aggregate contract sales price of 82.6 million. These proceeds were primarily used to fund a portion of the Closing Payments. 
 56 

Dispositions Subsequent to September 30, 2024 
 Sub sequent to September 30, 2024, we disposed of one OMF in Indiana for a contract sales price of 2.4 million. These proceeds are availab le for general and corporate uses, including for the potential partial repayment of t he Promissory Note. We have also signed purchase and sale agreements t o dispose of seven OMFs for an aggregate contract sales price of 49.8 million. There can be no assurance that these signed agreements will close on their contemplated terms or at all. 
 We anticipate primarily using net proceeds from these strategic dispositions, which we expect to occur during the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025, to repay the Promissory Note, which matures on June 28, 2025 and provides for an interest rate step-up to Term SOFR plus 3.25 on and after January 1, 2025. There can be no assurance that we will generate enough net proceeds through these strategic dispositions to fully repay the Promissory Note before the interest rate step-up becomes effective or that these strategic dispositions will occur on the contemplated terms or at all. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We did not repurchase any shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This section discusses the non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our performance including Funds from Operations FFO and Adjusted Funds from Operations AFFO ). A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net loss attributable to common stockholders, are provided below. 
 We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful supplemental measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare our operating performance between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent, nor are they meant to replace, cash flows from operations and net income or loss as defined by GAAP, and should not be considered alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. Rather, FFO and AFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements, including our ability to pay dividends and other distributions to our stockholders. Additionally, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define AFFO differently than we do. 
 
 Funds from Operations 
 Our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP, utilizing historical cost accounting which, among other things, requires depreciation of real estate investments. As a result, our operating results imply that the value of our real estate investments will decrease predictably over a set time period. However, we believe that the value of our real estate investments will fluctuate over time based on various market conditions and as such, depreciation under historical cost accounting may be less informative. FFO is a standard REIT industry metric defined by NAREIT as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted for (i) real estate-related depreciation and amortization, (ii) impairment charges on depreciable real property, (iii) gains or losses from sales of depreciable real property and (iv) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. 
 We believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to investors and to management, and when compared year-over-year reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net loss. 
 Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 We also believe that AFFO is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP measure of our operating results. We calculate AFFO by further adjusting FFO to reflect the performance of our portfolio for items we believe are not directly attributable to our operations. We believe that AFFO is a beneficial indicator of our ongoing portfolio performance and isolates the financial results of our operations. Our adjustments to FFO to arrive at AFFO include removing the impacts of (i) acquisition and transaction related costs (including certain expenses directly related to the Internalization and the Reverse Stock-Split), (ii) amortization of market-lease intangible assets and liabilities, (iii) adjustments for straight-line rent, (iv) termination fees to related parties (v) equity-based compensation expense, (vi) depreciation and amortization related to non-real estate related assets, (vii) mark-to-market gains and losses from our non-designated derivatives, (viii) non-cash components of interest expense and (ix) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. We believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry and is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies.

The table below reflects the items deducted from or added to net loss attributable to stockholders in our calculation of FFO and AFFO for the periods indicated:

 (2) Includes certain advisory, legal, accounting, information technology, tax and other professional expenses and other non-recurring employee transition expenses of 4.8 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, that were directly related to the Internalization and the Reverse Stock Split. We do not consider these expenses to be indicative of our performance given their unique and non-recurring nature. 
 (3) Represents the Closing Payments paid in connection with the Internalization. We do not consider such payments to be indicative of our performance given its unique and non-recurring nature. 
 (4) Presented as total gains or losses from our non-designated derivatives net of cash received. 
 (5) Non-cash components of interest expense include (i) deferred financing cost amortization, (ii) mortgage discount and premium amortization and (iii) amortized gains or losses from terminated hedging instruments. 
 
 Dividends and Other Distributions 
 Distributions on our Series A Preferred Stock are declared quarterly in an amount equal to 1.84375 per share each year 0.460938 per share per quarter) to holders of Series A Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to 7.375 of per annum in the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock. Distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day to holders of record on the close of business on the record date set by our board of directors and declared by us. 
 Distributions on our Series B Preferred Stock are declared quarterly in an amount equal to 1.78125 per share each year 0.445313 per share per quarter) to holders of Series B Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to 7.125 of per annum in the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock. Distributions on the Series B Preferred Stock are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year or, if not a business day, the next succeeding business day to holders of record on the close of business on the record date set by our board of directors and declared by us. 
 Since mid-2020, we have not paid cash dividends on our shares of common stock but we issued stock dividends to the holders from October 2020 until January 2024. The stock dividends were declared quarterly using a rate of 3.40 (as adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split) per share per year. The number of shares issued with each dividend is based on the estimated per share asset value in effect on the applicable date. We do not intend to declare further stock dividends in the future. 
 58 

The amount of dividends and other distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by the Board and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code ). Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds. The Board may reduce the amount of dividends or distributions paid or suspend dividend or distribution payments at any time and therefore dividend and distribution payments are not assured. Any accrued and unpaid distributions payable with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock become part of the liquidation preference thereof. 
 The following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to preferred stockholders, including distributions on unvested restricted shares and Common OP Units, but excluding distributions related to Class B Units as these distributions are recorded as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, for the periods indicated. No cash distributions were made to common stockholders, restricted shareholders, holders of Common OP Units or holders of Class B Units in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 ______ 
 (1) Assumes the use of available cash flows from operations before any other sources. 
 (2) Year-to-date total does not equal the sum of the quarters. Each quarter and year-to-date period is evaluated separately for purposes of this table. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows provided by operations were 86.3 million. We had not historically generated sufficient cash flows from operations to fund the payment of dividends and other distributions at the current rate prior to switching from paying cash dividends to stock dividends on our common stock. As shown in the table above, we funded distributions to holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Units with cash flows provided by operations and with available cash on hand. 
 Our ability to pay distributions on our Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series A Preferred Units and other distributions depends on our ability to increase the amount of cash we generate from property operations which in turn depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to our ability to complete acquisitions of new properties and our ability to improve operations at our existing properties. There can be no assurance that we will complete acquisitions on a timely basis or on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. Our ability to improve operations at our existing properties is also subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will be successful in achieving this objective. 
 59 

Election as a REIT 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Commencing with that taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner but we can provide no assurances that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
 
 Inflation 
 We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases with tenants in our OMF segment that do not contain indexed escalation provisions, or those leases which have escalations at rates which do not exceed or approximate current inflation rates. As of September 30, 2024, the increase to the 12-month CPI for all items, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was 3.0 . To hel p mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, most of our leases with our tenants in our OMF segment contain rent escalation provisions which increase the cash that is due under these leases over time. These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures). Although most of our leases with tenants in our OMF segment contain rent escalation provisions, these rates are generally below the current rate of inflation. 
 In addition to base rent, depending on the specific lease, OMF tenants are generally required to pay either (i) their pro rata share of property operating and maintenance expenses, which may be subject to expense exclusions and floors or (ii) their share of increases in property operating and maintenance expenses to the extent they exceed the properties expenses for the base year of the respective leases. Property operating and maintenance expenses include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance. Increased operating costs paid by our tenants under these net leases could have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in their revenue, which may adversely affect our tenants ability to pay rent owed to us or property expenses to be paid, or reimbursed to us, by our tenants. Renewals of leases or future leases for our net lease properties may not be negotiated on a triple-net basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, in which event we may have to pay those costs. If we are unable to lease properties on a triple-net basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, or if tenants fail to pay required tax, utility and other impositions, we could be required to pay those costs. 
 Leases with residents at our SHOPs typically do not have rent escalations, however, we are able to renew leases at market rates as they mature due to their short-term nature. As inflation rates increase or persist at high levels, the cost of providing medical care at our SHOPs, particularly labor costs, will increase. If we are unable to admit new residents or renew resident leases at market rates, while bearing these increased costs from providing services to our residents, our results of operations may be affected.

 (I) BASIC RESTRICTIONS. 
 (A) (1) Except as set forth in any articles supplementary creating any class or series of shares of Capital Stock, no Person, other than an Excepted Holder, shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and (2) no Excepted Holder shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess of the Excepted Holder Limit for such Excepted Holder. 
 (B) No Person shall Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock to the extent that such Beneficial or Constructive Ownership of Shares would result in the Company being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year), or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT (including, but not limited to, Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership that would result in the Company owning (actually or Constructively) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the Company from such tenant 
 5 

would cause the Company to fail to satisfy any of the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code). 
 (C) Any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock that, if effective, would result in the Capital Stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 Persons (as determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares of Capital Stock. 
 (II) TRANSFER IN TRUST. If any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock occurs which, if effective, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning or Constructively Owning shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B), 
 (A) then that number of shares of Capital Stock the Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause such Person to violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) (rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to a Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described in Section 5.7(iii), effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the date of such Transfer, and such Person shall acquire no rights in such shares or 
 (B) if the transfer to the Trust described in clause (A) of this sentence would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) then the Transfer of that number of shares of Capital Stock that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares. 
 (III) To the extent that, upon a transfer of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II), a violation of any provision of this Section 5.7 would nonetheless be continuing (for example, where the ownership of shares of Capital Stock by a single Trust would violate the 100 stockholder requirement applicable to REITs), then shares of Capital Stock shall be transferred to the number of Trusts, each having a distinct Trustee and one or more Charitable Beneficiaries that are distinct from those of each other Trust, such that there is not violation of any provisions of this Section 5.7. 
 (b) REMEDIES FOR BREACH. If the Board shall at any time determine that a Transfer or other event has taken place that results in a violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) (whether or not such violation is intended), the Board shall take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the Company to redeem shares, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the books of the Company or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or other event provided, however, that any Transfer or attempted Transfer or other event in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a) shall automatically result in the transfer to the Trust described above, and, where applicable, such Transfer (or other event) shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-action) by the Board. 
 (c) NOTICE OF RESTRICTED TRANSFER. Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock that will or may violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(A) or (B) or any Person who would have owned shares of Capital Stock that resulted in a transfer to the Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II), in either case, shall immediately give written notice to the Company of such event, or in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice to the Company, and shall provide to the Company such other information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer on the Company s status as a REIT. 
 6 

(d) OWNERS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. Prior to the Restriction Termination Date 
 (I) every owner of more than five percent (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, shall give written notice to the Company stating the name and address of such owner, the number of shares of Capital Stock Beneficially Owned and a description of the manner in which such shares are held. Each such owner shall provide to the Company such additional information as the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Beneficial Ownership on the Company s status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and 
 (II) each Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of Capital Stock and each Person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding Capital Stock for a Beneficial Owner or a Constructive Owner shall provide to the Company such information as the Company may request in order to determine the Company s status as a REIT and to comply with requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance. 
 (e) REMEDIES NOT LIMITED. Subject to Section 7.4 hereof, nothing contained in this Section 5.7(ii)(e) shall limit the authority of the Board to take such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the Company and the interests of the Stockholders in preserving the Company s status as a REIT. 
 (f) AMBIGUITY. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the provisions of this Section 5.7(ii), Section 5.7(iii), or any definition contained in Section 5.7(i), the Board shall have the power to determine the application of the provisions of this Section 5.7(ii) or Section 5.7(iii) or any such definition with respect to any situation based on the facts known to it. In the event Section 5.7(ii) or (iii) requires an action by the Board and the Charter fails to provide specific guidance with respect to such action, the Board shall have the power to determine the action to be taken so long as such action is not contrary to the provisions of Section 5.7. Absent a decision to the contrary by the Board (which the Board may make in its sole and absolute discretion), if a Person would have (but for the remedies set forth in Section 5.7(ii)(b)) acquired Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock in violation of Section 5.7(ii)(a), such remedies (as applicable) shall apply first to the shares of Capital Stock which, but for such remedies, would have been Beneficially Owned or Constructively Owned (but not actually owned) by such Person, pro rata among the Persons who actually own such shares of Capital Stock based upon the relative number of the shares held by each such Person. 
 (g) EXCEPTIONS. 
 (I) Subject to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B), the Board, in its sole discretion, may (prospectively or retroactively) exempt a Person from the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and may establish or increase an Excepted Holder Limit for such Person if 
 (A) the Board obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain that no individual s Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of such shares of Capital Stock will violate Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B) such Person does not and represents that it will not, actually own or Constructively Own an interest in a tenant of the Company (or a tenant of any entity owned or controlled by the Company) that would cause the Company to actually own or Constructively Own more than a 9.9 interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in such tenant and the Board obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain this fact (for this purpose, a tenant from whom the Company (or an entity owned or controlled by the Company) derives (and is expected to continue to derive) a sufficiently small amount of revenue such that, 
 7 

in the opinion of the Board, rent from such tenant would not adversely affect the Company s ability to qualify as a REIT, shall not be treated as a tenant of the Company) and 
 (B) such Person agrees that any violation or attempted violation of such representations or undertakings (or other action which is contrary to the restrictions contained in Section 5.7(ii)(a) through Section 5.7(ii)(f)) will result in such shares of Capital Stock being automatically Transferred to a Trust in accordance with Section 5.7(ii)(A)(II) and Section 5.7(iii). 
 (II) Prior to granting any exception pursuant to Section 5.7(ii)(g)(I), the Board may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board in its sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Company s status as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting such exception. 
 (III) Subject to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B), an underwriter which participates in an Offering or a private placement of shares of Capital Stock (or Securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Capital Stock) may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock (or Securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Capital Stock) in excess of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such Offering or private placement. 
 (IV) The Board may only reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder (1) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder at any time, or (2) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder. No Excepted Holder Limit shall be reduced to a percentage that is less than the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit. 
 (h) INCREASE OR DECREASE IN AGGREGATE SHARE OWNERSHIP LIMIT. Subject to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(I)(B), the Board may from time to time increase the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit for one or more Persons and decrease the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit for all other Persons provided, however, that the decreased Aggregate Share Ownership Limit will not be effective for any Person whose percentage ownership of Capital Stock is in excess of such decreased Aggregate Share Ownership Limit until such time as such Person s percentage of Capital Stock equals or falls below the decreased Aggregate Share Ownership Limit, but any further acquisition of Capital Stock in excess of such percentage ownership of Capital Stock will be in violation of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit and, provided further, that the new Aggregate Share Ownership Limit would not allow five or fewer Persons to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own more than 49.9 in value of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock. 
 (i) NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS UPON ISSUANCE OR TRANSFER. Upon issuance or Transfer of shares of Capital Stock prior to the Restriction Termination Date, the Company shall provide the recipient with a notice containing information about the shares of Capital Stock purchased or otherwise Transferred, in lieu of issuance of a share certificate, in a form substantially similar to the following

 8 

restrictive) of any class or series of shares of Capital Stock unless such Person is an Excepted Holder (in which case the Excepted Holder Limit shall be applicable) (ii) no Person may Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock that would result in the Company being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT and (iii) any Transfer of shares of Capital Stock that, if effective, would result in the Capital Stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 Persons (as determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void ab initio and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares. Any Person who Beneficially Owns or Constructively Owns or attempts to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock which causes or will cause a Person to Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Capital Stock in excess or in violation of the above limitations must immediately give written notice (or, in the case of an attempted transaction, give at least 15 days prior written notice) to the Company. If any of the restrictions on Transfer or ownership as set forth in (i) and (ii) above are violated, the shares of Capital Stock in excess or in violation of the above limitations will be automatically transferred to a Trustee of a Trust for the benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. In addition, the Company may redeem shares of Capital Stock upon the terms and conditions specified by the Board in its sole discretion if the Board determines that ownership or a Transfer or other event may violate the restrictions described in (i) and (ii) above. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of certain events, attempted Transfers in violation of the restrictions described above may be void ab initio. All capitalized terms in this notice have the meanings defined in the Charter, as the same may be amended from time to time, a copy of which, including the restrictions on Transfer and ownership, will be furnished to each holder of Capital Stock on request and without charge. Requests for such a copy may be directed to the Secretary of the Company at its principal office. 
 (iii) TRANSFER OF SHARES IN TRUST.

Upon any purported Transfer or other event described in Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II) that would result in a transfer of shares of Capital Stock to a Trust, such shares shall be transferred to the Trustee as trustee of a Trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more Charitable Beneficiaries. Such transfer to the Trustee shall be effective as of the close of business on the Business Day prior to the purported Transfer or other event that results in the transfer to the Trust pursuant to Section 5.7(ii)(a)(II). The Trustee shall be appointed by the Company and shall be a Person unaffiliated with the Company and any Prohibited Owner. Each Charitable Beneficiary shall be designated by the Company as provided in Section 5.7(iii)(f).

 9

Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary.

 (e) PURCHASE RIGHT IN STOCK TRANSFERRED TO THE TRUSTEE. Shares of Capital Stock transferred to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to the Company, or its designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise or gift) and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Company, or its designee, accepts such offer. The Company may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and other Distributions which have been paid to the Prohibited Owner and are owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.7(iii)(c). The Company may pay the amount of such reduction to the Trustee for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The Company shall have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold the shares held in the Trust pursuant to Section 5.7(iii)(d). Upon such a sale to the Company, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner.

The fact that the settlement of any transaction occurs shall not negate the effect of any provision of Sections 5.7, and any transfer in such a transaction shall be subject to all of the provisions and limitations set forth in Section 5.7. 
 Section V.9 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of Section 5.7 or any application of any such provision is determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable by any court having jurisdiction over the issue, the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of Section 5.7 shall not be affected and other applications of such provision shall be affected only to the extent necessary to comply with the determination of such court. 
 10 

Section V.10 ENFORCEMENT. The Company is authorized specifically to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, to enforce the provisions of Section 5.7.

Except as may be provided by the Board in setting the terms of classified or reclassified Shares pursuant to Section 5.4 or as may otherwise be provided by contract approved by the Board, no holder of Shares shall, as such holder, have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any additional Shares or any other Security of the Company which it may issue or sell. Holders of Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided for under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL or any successor statute unless the Board, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board, shall determine that such rights apply, with respect to all or any classes or series of Shares, to one or more transactions occurring after the date of such determination in connection with which holders of such Shares would otherwise be entitled to exercise such rights. 
 Article VI. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Cumulative voting for Directors is prohibited.

SECTION 4. LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. 
 Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Company, after payment of or provision for the Company s debts and liabilities and any other class or series of equity securities of the Company ranking, with respect to rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, senior to the Series A Preferred Stock and before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of equity securities of the Company ranking, with respect to rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to its stockholders a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of payment (whether or not declared). If, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the available assets of the Company are insufficient to pay the amount of the distributions payable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Company, on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of other classes or series of securities of the Company ranking, with respect to rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and each such other class or series of securities ranking, with respect to rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. Written notice of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first-class mail, postage pre-paid, at least 20 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of Series A Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the stock transfer records of the Company. After the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have received the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, they will have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Company. The consolidation, conversion or merger of the Company with or into any other person, corporation, trust or entity, or the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company (whether in connection with a Change of Control or otherwise), shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Company. 
 In determining whether any distribution (other than upon voluntary or involuntary dissolution) by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of Shares or otherwise is permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, amounts that would be needed, if the Company were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not be added to the Company s total liabilities.

 (k) In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control Conversion Right, the Company shall comply with all U.S. federal and state securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Conversion Consideration.

 (b) Whenever dividends on any outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have not been paid for six or more Series A Dividend Periods (whether or not such dividends have been authorized or declared or the Series A Dividend Periods are consecutive) (a Preferred Dividend Default ), the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (and all other classes and series of preferred stock of the Company ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and with which such holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class (the Parity Preferred )) will have the exclusive power, voting together as a single class, to elect two additional directors (the Preferred Directors ), at each annual meeting of the Company s stockholders and at any special meeting of the Company s stockholders called for the purpose of electing Preferred Directors (pursuant to Section 9(d) hereof or otherwise), until all dividends accrued and unpaid on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for all past Series A Dividend Periods and the then-current Series A Dividend Period have been fully paid. Unless the number of the Company s directors has previously been increased pursuant to the terms of any other class or series of Parity Preferred with which such holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class in the election of Preferred Directors, the number of the Company s directors shall automatically increase by two at such time as holders of Series A Preferred Stock become entitled to vote in the election of the Preferred Directors. Unless shares of Parity Preferred remain outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Directors, the term of office of each Preferred Director will terminate, and the number of the Company s directors shall automatically decrease by two, when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past Series A Dividend Periods and the then-current Series A Dividend Period have been fully paid. If the right of holders of Series A Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Directors terminates after the record date for determining holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to vote in any election of Preferred Directors but before the closing of the polls in such election, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of the applicable record date shall not be entitled to vote in the election of any Preferred Directors. The right of holders of Series A Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Directors shall again vest if and whenever dividends are in arrears for six Series A Dividend Periods, as described above. In no event shall holders of Series A Preferred Stock be entitled to nominate or elect an individual as a Preferred Director, and no individual shall be qualified to be nominated for election or to serve as a Preferred Director, if the individual s service as a Preferred Director would cause the Company to fail to satisfy a requirement relating to director independence of any national securities exchange on which any class or series of Stock is listed or otherwise conflict with the Charter or the Company s Bylaws. 
 (c) The Preferred Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election of such directors, and each Preferred Director will serve until the next annual meeting of the Company s stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies, or until such director s term of office terminates as set forth in Section 9(b). Any director elected by holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any Parity Preferred, voting together as a single class, may be removed, with or without cause, only by a vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred with which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class in the election of Preferred Directors. At any time that holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote in the election of the Preferred Directors, such holders shall be entitled to vote in the election of a successor to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from the removal of a Preferred Director. 
 25 

(d) At any time that holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have the right to elect Preferred Directors as described in Section 9(b) hereof but these directors have not been elected, the Company s secretary must call a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing the Preferred Directors upon the written request of the holders of record of 10 of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any class or series of Parity Preferred with which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class with respect to the election of Preferred Directors, unless the request is received more than 45 days and less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the Company s stockholders at which such vote would otherwise occur, in which case, the Preferred Directors may be elected at either such annual meeting or at a separate special meeting of the Company s stockholders at the Company s discretion.

 (f) The following actions shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock 
 (i) any increase or decrease in the number of authorized Shares of any class or series, any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock or the classification or reclassification of any unissued Shares, or the creation or issuance of equity securities, of any class or series ranking, junior or on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, provided that such action does not decrease the number of authorized shares of Common Stock below the number (after giving effect to all other outstanding shares capital stock) necessary to permit the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted in full in accordance with the terms hereof or 
 (ii) any amendment, alteration, or repeal or other change to any provisions of the Charter, including the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, as a result of a merger, conversion, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or other business combination (an Event ), (x) if the Series A Preferred Stock (or securities of any successor person or entity to the Company into which the Series A Preferred Stock has been converted) remains outstanding with the terms thereof unchanged in all material respects or the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock receive securities of a successor person or entity with substantially identical rights as those of Series A Preferred Stock, taking into account that, upon the occurrence of an Event, the Company may not be the surviving entity, or (y) if holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of such Event (other than any declared dividends having a Series A Record Date before the date of such Event and a Series A Payment Date after the date of such Event, which shall be paid as provided in Section 3 above), pursuant to the occurrence of any Event. 
 (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of any Parity Preferred shall not be entitled to vote together as a single class with holders of Series A Preferred Stock on any amendment, alteration, repeal or other change to any provision of the Charter, including the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, unless such action affects holders of Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Preferred equally. On any matter in which the Series A Preferred Stock may vote, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast one vote, except that, in class votes, or in determining the percentage of outstanding shares, when voting together as a single 
 26 

class, with shares of one or more class or series of Parity Preferred, shares of different classes and series shall vote, or such determination shall be made, in proportion to the liquidation preference of such shares. 
 (h) The foregoing voting provisions of this Section 9 shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds, in cash, shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption, in each case, in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
 (i) Except as expressly stated herein, the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any relative, participating, optional or other special voting rights and powers and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action, including, without limitation, any merger, conversion or consolidation of the Company or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, irrespective of the effect that such merger, conversion or consolidation or sale may have upon the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

 (i) The Company shall deliver the applicable Conversion Consideration no later than the third Business Day following the Change of Control Conversion Date. 
 (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8, no holder of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to exercise a Change of Control Conversion Right or convert any shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock to the extent that receipt of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with this Section 8 would cause such person or any other person to violate Section 5.7 of Article V of the Charter. 
 (k) In connection with the exercise of any Change of Control Conversion Right, the Company shall comply with all U.S. federal and state securities laws and stock exchange rules in connection with any conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into Conversion Consideration.

 (b) Whenever dividends on any outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have not been paid for six or more Series B Dividend Periods (whether or not such dividends have been authorized or declared or the Series B Dividend Periods are consecutive) (a Preferred Dividend Default ), the holders of Series B Preferred Stock (and all other classes and series of preferred stock of the Company ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and with which such holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class, including, without limitation, the Series A Preferred Stock (the Parity Preferred )), will have the exclusive power, voting together as a single class, to elect two additional directors (the Preferred Directors ), at each annual meeting of the Company s stockholders and at any special meeting of the Company s stockholders called for the purpose of electing Preferred Directors (pursuant to Section 9(d) hereof or otherwise), until all dividends accrued and unpaid on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for all past Series B Dividend Periods and the then-current Series B Dividend Period have been fully paid. Unless the number of the Company s directors has previously been increased pursuant to the terms of any other class or series of Parity Preferred with which such holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class in the election of Preferred Directors, the number of the Company s directors shall automatically increase by two at such time as holders of Series B Preferred Stock become entitled to vote in the election of the Preferred Directors. Unless shares of Parity Preferred remain outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of Preferred Directors, the term of office of each Preferred Director will terminate, and the number of the Company s directors shall automatically decrease by two, when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past Series B Dividend Periods and the then-current Series B Dividend Period have been fully paid.

In no event shall holders of Series B Preferred Stock be entitled to nominate or elect an individual as a Preferred Director, and no individual shall be qualified to be nominated for election or to serve as a Preferred Director, if the individual s service as a Preferred Director would cause the Company to fail to satisfy a requirement relating to director independence of any national securities exchange on which any class or series of Stock is listed or otherwise conflict with the Charter or the Company s Bylaws. 
 (c) The Preferred Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election of such directors, and each Preferred Director will serve until the next annual meeting of the Company s stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies, or until such director s term of office terminates as set forth in Section 9(b). Any director elected by holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any Parity Preferred, voting together as a single class, may be removed, with or without cause, only by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast collectively by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred with which holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class in the election of Preferred Directors. At any time that holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote in the election of the Preferred Directors, such holders shall be entitled to vote in the election of a successor to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from the removal of a Preferred Director. 
 (d) At any time that holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have the right to elect Preferred Directors as described in Section 9(b) hereof but these directors have not been elected, the Company s secretary must call a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing the Preferred Directors upon the written request of stockholders of record entitled to cast at least 10 of the votes entitled to be cast collectively by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any class or series of Parity Preferred with which holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class with respect to the election of Preferred Directors, unless the request is received more than 45 days and less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the Company s stockholders at which such vote would otherwise occur, in which case, the Preferred Directors may be elected at either such annual meeting or at a separate special meeting of the Company s stockholders at the Company s discretion. 
 (e) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, the approval of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast collectively by the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any equally-affected class or series of Parity Preferred with which holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together as a single class, voting together as a single class, shall be required to authorize (i) any amendment, alteration, repeal or other change to any provision of the Charter, including the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock (whether by merger, conversion, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or otherwise), that would materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock or (ii) the creation, issuance or increase in the authorized number of shares of any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock (or any equity securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares, but not including debt securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such shares prior to the time of conversion) with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
 (f) The following actions shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series B Preferred Stock 
 (i) any increase or decrease in the number of authorized Shares of any class or series, any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series B Preferred Stock or the classification or reclassification of any unissued Shares, or the creation or issuance of equity securities, of any class or series ranking, junior or on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the Company s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, provided that such action does not decrease the number of 
 40 

authorized shares of Common Stock below the number (after giving effect to all other outstanding shares capital stock) necessary to permit the Series B Preferred Stock to be converted in full in accordance with the terms hereof or 
 (ii) any amendment, alteration, or repeal or other change to any provisions of the Charter, including the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, as a result of a merger, conversion, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the Company s assets or other business combination (an Event ), (x) if the Series B Preferred Stock (or securities of any successor person or entity to the Company into which the Series B Preferred Stock has been converted) remains outstanding with the terms thereof unchanged in all material respects or the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock receive securities of a successor person or entity with substantially identical rights as those of Series B Preferred Stock, taking into account that, upon the occurrence of an Event, the Company may not be the surviving entity, or (y) if holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive the 25.00 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of such Event (other than any declared dividends having a Series B Record Date before the date of such Event and a Series B Payment Date after the date of such Event, which shall be paid as provided in Section 3 above), pursuant to the occurrence of any Event. 
 (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of any Parity Preferred shall not be entitled to vote together as a single class with holders of Series B Preferred Stock on any amendment, alteration, repeal or other change to any provision of the Charter, including the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, unless such action affects holders of Series B Preferred Stock and such Parity Preferred equally. On any matter in which the Series B Preferred Stock may vote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast one vote, except that, in class votes, or in determining the percentage of outstanding shares, when voting together as a single class, with shares of one or more class or series of Parity Preferred, shares of different classes and series shall vote, or such determination shall be made, in proportion to the liquidation preference of such shares. 
 (h) The foregoing voting provisions of this Section 9 shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds, in cash, shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption, in each case, in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
 (i) Except as expressly stated herein, the Series B Preferred Stock shall not have any relative, participating, optional or other special voting rights and powers and the consent of the holders thereof shall not be required for the taking of any corporate action, including, without limitation, any merger, conversion or consolidation of the Company or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, irrespective of the effect that such merger, conversion or consolidation or sale may have upon the rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of Series B Preferred Stock.

There shall be no difference in the rights and obligations of stockholders based on whether or not their shares are represented by certificates. 
 Section 2. TRANSFERS . All transfers of shares of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation in such manner as the Board of Directors or any officer of the Corporation may prescribe and, if such shares are certificated, upon surrender of certificates duly endorsed.

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of shares of any class or series of stock will be subject in all respects to the Charter and all of the terms and conditions contained therein. 
 Section 3. REPLACEMENT CERTIFICATE .

Unless otherwise determined by an officer of the Corporation, the owner of such lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, shall be required, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, to give the Corporation a bond in such sums as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation. 
 Section 4. FIXING OF RECORD DATE . The Board of Directors may set, in advance, a record date for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of any other rights, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other proper purpose.

 Article XII INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCE OF EXPENSES 
 To the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, the Corporation shall indemnify and, without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to indemnification, shall pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to (a) any individual who is a 
 16 

present or former director or officer of the Corporation and who is made or threatened to be made a party to, or witness in, the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity or (b) any individual who, while a director or officer of the Corporation and at the request of the Corporation, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member or manager of another corporation, real estate investment trust, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to, or witness in, the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity and (c) American Realty Capital Healthcare II Advisors, LLC and its affiliates from and against any claim, liability or expense to which they may become subject or which they may incur by reason of their service as advisor to the Corporation. The rights of a director or officer to indemnification and advance of expenses provided by the Charter and these Bylaws shall vest immediately upon election of such director or officer. The Corporation may, with the approval of its Board of Directors, provide such indemnification and advance for expenses to an individual who served a predecessor of the Corporation in any of the capacities described in (a) or (b) above and to any employee or agent of the Corporation or a predecessor of the Corporation or American Realty Capital Healthcare II Advisors, LLC. The indemnification and payment or reimbursement of expenses provided in these Bylaws shall not be deemed exclusive of or limit in any way other rights to which any person seeking indemnification or payment or reimbursement of expenses may be or may become entitled under any bylaw, resolution, insurance, agreement or otherwise. 
 Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article, nor the adoption or amendment of any other provision of the Charter or these Bylaws inconsistent with this Article, shall apply to or affect in any respect the applicability of the preceding paragraph with respect to any act or failure to act which occurred prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption. 
 Article XIII WAIVER OF NOTICE 
 Whenever any notice of a meeting is required to be given pursuant to the Charter or these Bylaws or pursuant to applicable law, a waiver thereof in writing or by electronic transmission, given by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any meeting need be set forth in the waiver of notice of such meeting, unless specifically required by statute. The attendance of any person at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. 
 Article XIV EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LITIGATION 
 Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or, if that Court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, other than actions arising under federal securities laws, (b) any Internal Corporate Claim, as such term is defined in the MGCL, or any successor provision thereof, including, without limitation, (i) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or to the stockholders of the Corporation or (ii) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL, the Charter or these Bylaws, or (c) any other action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the Corporation that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. None of the foregoing actions, claims or proceedings may be brought in any court sitting outside the State of Maryland unless the Corporation consents in writing to such court.
