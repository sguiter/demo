Overview of Our Business 

Future FinTech is a holding company incorporated
under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company historically engaged in the production and sale of fruit juice concentrates (including
fruit purees and fruit juices), fruit beverages (including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages) in the PRC. Due to drastically
increased production costs and tightened environmental laws in China, the Company had transformed its business from fruit juice manufacturing
and distribution to financial technology related service businesses. The main business of the Company includes supply chain financing
services and trading in China, asset management business in Hong Kong and cross-border money transfer service in UK. The Company also
expanded into brokerage and investment banking business in Hong Kong and cryptocurrency mining farm in the U.S. The Company had contractual
arrangements with a VIE E-Commerce Tianjin in China, which has generated minimal revenue and business since 2021 due to the negative impact
caused by COVID-19. The Company started the process to close it down in November 2023 and completed deregistration and dissolution of
the VIE with local authority on March 7, 2024.

There are legal and operational risks associated
with being based in and having a substantial majority of operations in China and Hong Kong. These risks could result in a material change
in our operations and/or the value of our common stock or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue
to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or be worthless. In the past few years, the
PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice,
including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas
using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts
in anti-monopoly enforcement. On July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office
of the State Council jointly issued an announcement to crack down on illegal activities in the securities market and promote the high-quality
development of the capital market, which, among other things, requires the relevant governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border
oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over China-based companies listed overseas, and to establish
and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities laws. On February 15, 2022, Cybersecurity Review Measures

b) an issuer making an overseas securities offering after having been listed on an overseas market; c) a domestic company seeking an overseas
direct or indirect listing of its assets through single or multiple acquisition(s), share swap, transfer of shares or other means. According
to the Notice on Arrangements for Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Enterprises, published by the CSRC on February
17, 2023, a company that (i) has already completed overseas listing or (ii) has already obtained the approval for the offering or listing
from overseas securities regulators or exchanges but has not completed such offering or listing before effective date of the new rules
and also completes the offering or listing before September 30, 2023 are considered as an existing listed company and is not required
to make any filing until it conducts a new offering in the future. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of any of the material events specified
below after an issuer has completed its offering and listed its securities on an overseas stock exchange, the issuer shall submit a report
thereof to the CSRC within 3 business days after the occurrence and public disclosure of the event: (i) change of control; (ii) investigations
or sanctions imposed by overseas securities regulatory agencies or other competent authorities; (iii) change of listing status or transfer
of listing segment; or (iv) voluntary or mandatory delisting. The New Overseas Listing Rules stipulate the legal consequences to
the companies for breaches, including failure to fulfill filing obligations or filing documents having false statement or misleading information
or material omissions, which may result in a fine ranging from RMB1 million to RMB10 million, and in cases of severe violations, the relevant
responsible persons may also be barred from entering the securities market. On February 24, 2023, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance,
the National Administration of State Secretes Protection and the National Archives Administration released the Provisions on Strengthening
the Confidentiality and Archives Administration Related to the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the
Confidentiality and Archives Administration Provisions, which took effect on March 31, 2023. PRC domestic enterprises seeking to offer
securities and list in overseas markets, either directly or indirectly, shall establish and improve the system of confidentiality and
archives work, and shall complete approval and filing procedures with competent authorities, if such PRC domestic enterprises or their
overseas listing entities provide or publicly disclose documents or materials involving state secrets and work secrets of state organs
to relevant securities companies, securities service institutions, overseas regulatory agencies and other entities and individuals. It
further stipulates that (i) providing or publicly disclosing documents and materials which may adversely affect national security or public
interests, and accounting records or photocopies thereof to relevant securities companies, securities service institutions, overseas regulatory
agencies and other entities and individuals shall be subject to corresponding procedures in accordance with relevant laws and regulations;

enterprises with securities services relating to overseas securities issuance and listing shall be stored in the territory of the PRC,

date of this report, these new laws and guidelines that became effective have not impacted the Company s ability to conduct its
business, accept foreign investment or list on a U.S. or other foreign stock exchange except for the filing requirement under New Overseas
Listing Rules. The Company is still processing the filings with CSRC for its offerings since the effective of New Overseas Listing Rules
and has not complied the filing requirements yet which would subject the Company to fines and other penalties for violation of New Overseas
Listing Rules. In addition, new rules and regulations could be adopted and there are uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement
of existing laws and guidelines, which could materially and adversely impact our business and financial outlook and may impact our ability
to accept foreign investments or continue to list on a U.S. or other foreign stock exchange. Any change in foreign investment regulations,
and other policies in China or related enforcement actions by China government could result in a material change in our operations and
the value of our securities and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer our securities to investors or cause
the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.

Impact of COVID-19 on our business 

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus
was reported and has spread throughout China and other parts of the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized
the outbreak as a pandemic . In early 2020, Chinese government took emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus,
including quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in China. In response to
the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company was following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes
the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Our offices in China were closed and the employees
worked from home at the end of January 2020 until late March 2020. The quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of
office buildings materially negatively impacted our business. Any new variant and outbreak of COVID-19 might disrupt our supply chain,
logistics providers, customers or our marketing activities , which could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations.
There were outbreaks in various cities and provinces in China due to Omicron variant, such as Xi an city, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing
and other cities in 2022, which have resulted quarantines, travel restrictions, and temporary closure of office buildings and facilities
in these cities. In December 2022, the Chinese government eased its strict zero COVID-19 policy which resulted in a surge of new
COVID-19 cases during December 2022 and January 2023, which has disrupted our business operations in China. The Company s promotion
strategy of CCM Shopping Mall previously mainly relied on the training of members and distributors through meetings and conferences. Chinese
government put a restriction on large gatherings in 2020 and 2021, which made the promotion strategy for our online e-commerce platforms
difficult to implement and the Company experienced difficulties to subscribe new members for its online e-commerce platforms. Since
2021, CCM generated minimal revenue and business for the Company. The Company started a process to close it down in November 2023 and
completed deregistration and dissolution of the VIE with local authority on March 7, 2024. 

While the potential economic impact brought by
new variants of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global
financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. Further, as we do not have access
to a revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure commercial debt financing in the future in the
event that we require additional capital. In the event that we do need to raise capital in the future and there is any outbreak due to
new variants, outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.

2024 decreased to approximately 5.18 million from approximately 23.74 million for the same period of the last year. The decrease in
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to decrease revenue from supply chain financing/trading, as the
real estate, infrastructure and overall economy in China have slowed down in 2024. The demand for sand and steel has dropped during three
months ended September 30, 2024 comparing to the same period of 2023, and coal price has decreased in China and the market demand has

million from 3.27 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.71 million for the same period of 2024, as the Company
hired more seasoned account managers to boost the services and the revenues. 

Other revenues increased from 0.47 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.04 million for the same period of 2024, mainly due to the increased debt recovery consulting
service fee as well as U.S. dollar bond service income of approximately 0.50 million, as we did not have such income in the third quarter
2023.

segment during the third quarter of 2024. Overall gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 29.25 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, an increase of 22.42 from 5.95 for the same period of last fiscal year, mainly due to higher profit margin from supply chain

Overall
gross profit increased to 5.06 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.86 million for the same period of 2023. The
increase is mainly due to others including debt recovery consulting service fee as well as U.S. dollar bond service income of approximately
 0.60 million and cryptocurrency mining service income of 0.65 million, as we did not have such income in 2023. Overall gross margin
as a percentage of revenue was 34.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 22.38 from 12.51 for the same period
of last fiscal year, mainly due to higher profit margin from supply chain financing/trading business for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, comparing to the same period of 2023, which was mainly due to higher supply chain financing/trading cost in 2023.

General and administrative expenses increased
by 0.54 million, or 5.62 , to 10.13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 9.59 million for the same period of last
fiscal year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to increased professional service fees for lawyers for
litigation with FT Global and internal control training fees. 

Selling
expenses increased by 0.18 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of last fiscal year.
The increase in selling expenses was mainly due to increased employees salaries. 

Bad debt provision increased by 5.09 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of last fiscal year. The increase was due to bad debt recovery
recognized in previous years and a different bad debt provision accounting treatment method used in 2024. 

The Company recorded 3,029 of research and development
expenses during nine months ended September 30, 2024. Research and development expenses include salaries, contracted services, as well
as the related expenses of our research and product development team, and expenditures relating to our efforts to develop, design new
products and services, and enhance our existing products and services to our clients. Research and development expenses decreased by 0.34
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of last fiscal year. The decrease in research and
development expenses was mainly due to decreased salaries. 

Other Income (Expense), Net 

Other
expenses, net increased by 0.43 million to 1.15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.71 million in the same
period of the last fiscal year, primarily due to primarily due to civil penalty payments for the settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and change of foreign currency exchange rate and impact of exchange gains and losses. 

37 

Income Tax 

Tax provision decreased by 0.07 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreased revenue.

Net loss from continue operation increased by
 4.63 million from 6.07 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.70 million for the same period of 2024 mainly due
to the increase in operating expenses, as discussed above. 

Gain on disposal of discontinued operations 

Gain on disposal of discontinued operation was
 0.64 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was related to the dissolution and deregistration of Chain Cloud Mall
Network and Technology (Tianjin) Co., Limited and Tianjin Future Private Equity Fund Management Partnership (Ltd Partnership). 

Loss per Share 

Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing
operations were 0.53 and 0.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to a loss of 0.40 and 0.40 for

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and restricted
cash of 6.52 million, as compared to 19.02 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash
was mainly due to increased other current asset from the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Our working capital has historically been generated
from our operating cash flows, advances from our customers and loans from bank facilities. Our working capital was 28.29 million as of
September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10.85 million from working capital of 39.14 million as of September 30, 2023, mainly due to the decrease
in current assets and an increase in current liabilities. 

Net cash used in operating activities increased
by 6.10 million to 13.52 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.43 million for the same period of the last fiscal
year. The increase in net cash used by operating activities was primarily due to increase in advances to suppliers and other current assets. 

Net cash used in investing activities increased
 14.94 million to 1.18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from positive 13.76 million for the same period of the last
fiscal year. It was due to decrease in repayment for loan receivable. 

Net cash provided in financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.32 million representing an increase of 4.23 million, as compared to cash used in financing
activities of 2.91 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was
mainly due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock from a private placement, net of issuance costs. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal interim financial officer, respectively,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act,
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we currently lack sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level
of knowledge, experience and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. 

We have taken, and are taking, certain actions
to remediate the material weakness related to our lack of U.S. GAAP experience. We have engaged an outside consultant with U.S. GAAP knowledge
and experience to supplement our current internal accounting personnel and assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to
ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also engaged an internal control consulting firm in
July 2023 to review, test and improve our internal accounting controls and internal control over financial reporting which has issued
a report in early January 2024. We have adopted and are continuously implementing policies, procedures and practices recommended in the
report of the consultant and have arranged training of internal control for our employees and management on disclosure controls and procedures. We
believe the measures described above will remediate the material weakness from the quarter identified above. The Company continues to
make efforts to implementing its existing and newly adopted procedures to improve our disclosure controls and internal controls over financing
reporting. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may determine that additional
measures. 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Other than discussed above, there were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during
the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Legal case with FT Global Litigation 

In January 2021, FT Global Capital, Inc. FT
Global ), a former placement agent of the Company filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia.
FT Global served the complaint upon the Company in January 2021. In the complaint, FT Global alleges claims, most of which attempt to
hold the Company liable under legal theories that relate back to an alleged breach of an exclusive placement agent agreement between FT
Global and the Company in July 2020 which had a term of three months. FT Global claims that the Company failed to compensate FT Global
for securities purchase transactions between December 2020 and April 2021, pursuant to the terms of the expired exclusive placement agent
agreement. Allegedly, the exclusive placement agent agreement required the Company to pay FT Global for capital received during the term
of the agreement and for the 12-month period following the termination of the agreement involving any investors that FT Global introduced
and/or wall-crossed to the Company. However, the Company believes the securities purchase transactions at issue did not involve the one
investor which FT Global introduced or wall-crossed to the Company during the term of the agreement. FT Global claims approximately 7,000,000
in damages and attorneys fees. 

The Company timely removed the case to the
 United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the Court on February 9, 2021 based on diversity
 of jurisdiction. On March 9, 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss based on FT Global s failure to state a claim which
 is pending before the Court. On March 23, 2021, FT Global filed its response to the Company s motion to dismiss. FT Global
 argues that the Court should deny the Company s motion to dismiss. However, if the Court is inclined to grant the
 Company s motion to dismiss, FT Global requested that the Court permit it to file an amended complaint. On April 8, 2021, the
 parties filed a Joint Preliminary Report and Discovery Plan. On April 12, 2021, the Court approved the Joint Preliminary Report and
 Discovery Plan and issued a Scheduling Order placing this case on a six-month discovery tract. On April 30, 2021, the Company served
 FT Global with its Initial Disclosures. On May 6, 2021, FT Global served the Company with its Initial Disclosures. On May 17, 2021,
 FT Global served the Company with its First Amended Initial Disclosures. On November 10, 2021, the Court entered an Order granting
 the Company s motion to dismiss FT Global s fraud claim and breach of contract claim as to the disclosure of its
 confidential and proprietary information. The Court denied the Company s motion to dismiss FT Global s i) breach of
 contract claim for failure to pay FT Global pursuant to the terms of the exclusive placement agent agreement; ii) claim for breach
 of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and iii) claim for attorney s fees, and the court concluded that additional
 information can be obtained through discovery. The Company timely filed an answer and defenses to FT Global s complaint on
 November 24, 2021. On January 3, 2022 the Company propounded discovery requests upon FT Global, including interrogatories and
 requests for production of documents. On March 23, 2022, the Company propounded requests for admission upon FT Global. On March 24,
 2022, FT Global propounded discovery requests upon the Company, including requests for production of documents and requests for
 admission. On April 1, 2022, FT Global served its response to the Company s requests for production of documents. On May 13,
 2022, FT Global served its responses to the Company s interrogatories and requests for admissions. On May 13, 2022, FT Global
 produced documents in response to the Company s requests for production of documents. On June 3, 2022, the Company produced
 documents in response to FT Global s requests for production of documents. On August 3, 2022, the Company took the deposition
 of FT Global. On August 4, 2022, FT Global took the deposition of the Company. On August 3, 2022, the Court granted the
 parties Consent Motion to Extend Discovery Period extending the discovery period from August 5, 2022 to September 14, 2022
 and the deadline to file dispositive motions to October 12, 2022. On October 12, 2022, the Company filed a motion for summary
 judgment on all claims asserted by FT Global in this lawsuit. On November 2, 2022, FT Global filed its opposition to the
 Company s motion for summary judgment. On November 16, 2022, the Company filed its reply in support of its motion for summary
 judgment on all claims asserted by FT Global in this lawsuit. On August 31, 2023, the Court entered an Order denying the
 Company s motion for summary judgment. On September 20, 2023, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the deadline to file
 the consolidated pretrial order pending mediation of the case by the parties. On September 21, 2023, the Court granted the
 parties joint motion to extend the deadline to file the consolidated pretrial order to October 27, 2023. On October 16, 2023,
 the parties mediated the case. On October 24, 2023, the parties filed another joint motion to extend the deadline to file the
 consolidated pretrial order. On October 27, 2023, the Court granted the parties joint motion to extend the deadline to file
 the consolidated pretrial order to November 17, 2023 and set the case for trial on January 8, 2024. Subsequently, the Court approved
 an extension of the deadline to file a pretrial order to December 1, 2023. The Court has also rescheduled the trial to commence on
 April 8, 2024. The trial began on April 8, 2024 and ended on April 11, 2024, on which date the jury returned a verdict in favor of
 FT Global and the Court entered a judgment awarding FT Global 8,875,265.31. On April 16, 2024, the Court issued an amended
 judgment, awarding FT Global 10,598,379.93, which includes 7,895,265.31 in damages, 1,723,114.62 in prejudgment interest, and
 980,000.00 in attorney s fees. The Company filed a post-trial motion challenging the judgment on May 9, 2024, which
 remains pending before the Court. The Company will continue to vigorously defend the action against FT Global, including by
 appealing the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, if necessary. FT Global has registered the
 judgment in the Southern District of New York NY Court ), where FT Global has brought a motion requiring the Company
 to turn over its stock in its subsidiary companies. The Company has filed an opposition to the motion, arguing that according
 to the New York statute the Court should first determine that the value of the stock in the subsidiary is insufficient to satisfy
 the judgment as the Company believe the request for turnover is premature before a valuation hearing. On August 28, 2024, NY Court
 granted FT Global s motion for turnover of Defendant s shares in Defendant s wholly-owned subsidiaries as
 Defendant 1) failed to satisfy the 10.8 million judgment rendered in the Northern District of Georgia and registered in the
 Southern District of New York, and 2) is in possession of money and property in which it has an interest. The NY Court ordered
 Defendant shall turn over the shares, membership, or limited partnership interests in all of its subsidiaries, and the corporate
 seals of its China and Hong Kong-based subsidiaries, to the U.S. Marshal for auction or sale until the judgment is satisfied. The
 Company will continue to vigorously defend the action against FT Global, including by appealing the order of the NY Court to the
 United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
