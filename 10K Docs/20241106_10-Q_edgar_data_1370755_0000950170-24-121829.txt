of the assets of the Company. Investments listed on a recognized exchange or market quotation system, whether U.S. or foreign, are valued using the closing price on the date of valuation. Investments not listed on a recognized exchange or market quotation system, but for which reliable market quotations are readily available are valued using prices provided by a nationally recognized pricing service or by using quotations from broker-dealers. Investments for which market quotations are either not readily available or are determined to be unreliable are priced at fair value using affirmative valuations performed by independent valuation services approved by the Valuation Designee or, for investments aggregating less than of the total assets of the Company, using valuations determined directly by the Valuation Designee. Such valuations are determined under documented valuation policies and procedures reviewed and approved by a committee established by the Valuation Designee (the Valuation Committee ). Generally, to increase objectivity in valuing the investments, the Valuation Designee will utilize external measures of value, such as public markets or third-party transactions, whenever possible. The Valuation Designee s valuation is not based on long-term work-out value, immediate liquidation value, nor incremental value for potential changes that may take place in the future. The values assigned to investments are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot reasonably be determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated. Such circumstances may include macroeconomic, geopolitical and other events and conditions that may significantly impact the profitability or viability of businesses in which the Company is invested, and therefore may significantly impact the return

 of the Company s assets. Fair valuations of investments in each asset class are determined using one or more methodologies including market quotations, the market approach, income approach, or, in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Such information may include observed multiples of earnings and/or revenues at which transactions in securities of comparable companies occur, with appropriate adjustments for differences in company size, operations or other factors affecting comparability. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The discount rates used for such analyses reflect market yields for comparable investments, considering such factors as relative credit quality, capital structure, and other factors. In following these approaches, the types of factors that may be taken into account also include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparables, comparable costs of capital, the principal market in which the investment trades and enterprise values, among other factors. Investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in valuing such investments. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Transfers between levels are recognized as of the beginning of the reporting period.

Such positions were converted at the respective closing foreign exchange rates in effect at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and reported in U.S. dollars. Purchases and sales of investments and income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies, when they occur, are translated into U.S. dollars based on the foreign exchange rates in effect on the respective dates of such transactions. The portion of gains and losses on foreign investments resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies is included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments. Investments in foreign companies and securities of foreign governments may involve special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and securities of the U.S. government. These risks include, among other things, revaluation of currencies, less reliable information about issuers, different transaction clearance and settlement practices, and potential future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover, investments in foreign companies and securities of foreign governments and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. government.

 million and matures on June 9, 2025. Under the swap agreement, Merger Sub receives a fixed interest rate of and pays a floating interest rate of SOFR with payments due annually. Pursuant to the contract, Merger Sub was required to deposit initial margin with the broker in the form of cash and has agreed to receive from or pay to the broker daily variation margin. The amounts related to the right to claim or the obligation to return cash collateral may not be used to offset amounts due under the Interest Rate Swap contract in the normal course of settlement. Both the initial margin and variation margin paid are included as assets within Due from broker on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities at September 30, 2024. Since the swap contract has not been designated as a hedge accounting relationship pursuant to ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , changes in the fair value of the swap contract, net of any periodic interest accruals, are presented as part of change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Interest Rate Swap had a fair value of million, which is reflected as a liability on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities; such fair value is inclusive of any net periodic interest accruals and payments on the contract. Interest rate swap agreements are valued utilizing quotes received from independent pricing services or through brokers, which are derived using daily swap curves and models that incorporate a number of market data factors, such as discounted cash flows, trades and values of the underlying reference instruments. The fair value of the Interest Rate Swap is classified as Level 2 with respect to the fair value hierarchy. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not enter into any additional derivative transactions. Valuations of derivatives are determined using observable market inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and, accordingly, are generally classified as Level 2 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy.

 ASU 2020-06 under the modified retrospective basis as of . The impact of the Company s adoption under the modified retrospective basis required an adjustment of million to opening net assets for the remaining unamortized discount on the convertible senior unsecured notes due March 2022 issued by the Company (the 2022 Convertible Notes ), an increase to our debt balance in the amount of million as a result of the recombination of the equity conversion component of the 2022 Convertible Notes, and million lower interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company s adoption of this guidance did t have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2022-03 ), which clarifies guidance for fair value measurement of an equity security subject to a contractual sale restriction and establishes new disclosure requirements for such equity securities. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has concluded that this guidance will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

of the net asset value of the Company from to , (ii) reduced the incentive compensation on net investment income and net realized gains (reduced by any net unrealized losses) from to and (iii) reduced the cumulative total return hurdle from to . Accordingly, the Company s base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of on total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) up to an amount equal to of the net asset value of the Company, and thereafter. The base management fee is calculated on a consolidated basis as of the beginning of each quarter and is payable to the Advisor quarterly in arrears. In connection with the Merger, the Company and the Advisor entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement that became effective at the Closing, pursuant to which the Advisor reduced its base management fee rate for managing the Company from to on assets equal to or below of the net asset value of the Company with no change to the basis of calculation. Prior to the Closing, the Advisor's base management fee rate for managing the Company was on assets equal to or below 200 of the net asset value of the Company. The base management fee rate on assets that exceed of the net asset value of the Company remains . The base management fee is calculated on a consolidated basis as of the beginning of each quarter and is payable to the Advisor quarterly in arrears. In connection with the Merger, the Company also entered into a fee waiver agreement with the Advisor (the Fee Waiver Agreement ). The Fee Waiver Agreement provides that the Advisor will waive all or a portion of its advisory fees to the extent the adjusted net investment income of the Company on a per share basis (determined by dividing the adjusted net investment income of the Company by the weighted average outstanding shares of the Company during the relevant quarter) is less than per share in any of the first four (4) fiscal quarters ending after the Closing (the first of which will be the quarter in which the Closing occurred) to the extent there are sufficient advisory fees to cover such deficit (the waiver amount in a given quarter cannot exceed the total advisory fees for such quarter). For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no advisory fee waiver was required. Incentive compensation is only incurred to the extent the Company s cumulative total return (after incentive compensation) exceeds a annual rate on daily weighted-average contributed common equity. Subject to that limitation, incentive compensation is calculated on ordinary income (before incentive compensation) and net realized gains (net of any unrealized depreciation) at rates of on income since the fee reduction on February 8, 2019 and previously. Incentive compensation is computed as the difference between incentive compensation earned and incentive compensation paid, subject to the total return hurdle, on a cumulative basis since January 1, 2013, and is payable quarterly in arrears.

The estimated fair values of the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and the SBA Debentures were determined by discounting projected remaining payments using market interest rates for borrowings of the Company and entities with similar credit risks at the measurement date. The estimated fair value of the Merger Sub Facility was derived by taking the average of the high and low quotes as obtained from a broker. The estimated fair values of the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes were determined using market quotations, and the estimated fair value of the 2025 Notes was derived by an independent valuation firm. The estimated fair values of the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II, Merger Sub Facility, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and SBA Debentures as prepared for disclosure purposes were deemed to be Level 3 in the GAAP valuation hierarchy.

 million of convertible senior unsecured notes, which matured on . The 2022 Convertible Notes were general unsecured obligations of the Company, and ranked structurally junior to the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and the SBA Debentures. The Company did not have the right to redeem the 2022 Convertible Notes prior to maturity. The 2022 Convertible Notes bore interest at an annual rate of , paid semi-annually. In certain circumstances, the 2022 Convertible Notes could have been converted into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock (such combination to be at the Company s election), at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per one thousand dollar principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilutional adjustments. The initial conversion price was approximately above the per share closing price of the Company s common stock on August 30, 2016. Prior to its maturity on March 1, 2022, the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes exceeded the value of the conversion rate multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company s common stock. Therefore, additional shares were added to the calculation of diluted earnings per common share and weighted average common shares outstanding. The 2022 Convertible Notes were accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options . Upon conversion of any of the 2022 Convertible Notes, the Company intended to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, had the option to pay the excess amount in cash or shares of the Company s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares), subject to the requirements of the respective indenture. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the Company had determined that the embedded conversion options in 2022 Convertible Notes were not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives under GAAP. At the time of issuance the estimated values of the debt and equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes were approximately and , respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective basis. In accordance with this guidance, the Company recombined the equity conversion component of our 2022 Convertible Notes outstanding, and accounted for the 2022 Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This resulted in a cumulative decrease to additional paid in capital of million, partially offset by a decrease to accumulated loss of million as of January 1, 2022 (see Note 2). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2021, holders were permitted to convert their 2022 Convertible Notes only under certain circumstances set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2022 Convertible Notes. On or after September 1, 2021 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding March 1, 2022, holders may have converted their 2022 Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion, the Company would pay or deliver, as the case may be, at its election, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock, subject to the requirements of the indenture. No notes were converted prior to the notes maturing on . The original issue discounts equal to the equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes were recorded in paid-in capital in excess of par in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. As a result, the Company records interest expense comprised of both stated interest and amortization of the original issue discounts. At the time of issuance, the equity components of the 2022 Convertible Notes were million. Unsecured Notes On August 23, 2019, the Company issued million of unsecured notes. On November 26, 2019, the Company issued an additional million of the 2024 Notes and on October 2, 2020, the Company issued an additional million of the 2024 Notes for a total outstanding aggregate principal amount of million. The 2024 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount and bore interest at an annual rate of , payable . On August 23, 2024, the 2024 Notes matured and all principal was repaid. On February 9, 2021, the Company issued million of unsecured notes that mature on , unless previously repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms. The 2026 Notes were issued at a discount to the principal amount. On August 27, 2021, the Company issued an additional million of the 2026 Notes, at a premium to par, for a total outstanding aggregate principal amount of million. The 2026 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of , payable , and all principal is due upon maturity. The 2026 Notes may be redeemed in whole or part at the Company's option at a redemption price equal to par plus a "make whole" premium, as determined pursuant to the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, and any accrued and unpaid interest.

From time to time, the Company and the Advisor may be parties to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business, including with respect to our investments in our portfolio companies. On , the Company was named as a defendant, together with the Advisor and certain other funds managed by the Advisor, as well as certain other defendants, in a lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit relates to a third-party sponsored collateralized loan obligation in which the Company and certain other defendants invested. The suit alleges that the Company and the other defendants knew or should have known of certain fraudulent activities of the third-party manager relating to its management of the collateralized loan obligation that caused the plaintiffs to suffer investment losses. The suit seeks to recover from the Company approximately million, plus interest, additional amounts from the other Defendants, and attorneys fees and costs from all Defendants. The Company, the affiliated funds and the Advisor intend to vigorously defend against these claims. At this time, however, the Company and the Advisor cannot predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome, including any potential losses that could result. On November 6, 2023, the Company, the affiliated funds, and the Advisor, and certain other Defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which was fully briefed on February 12, 2024 and was argued in court on March 6, 2024.

 of the Market Price on the distribution payment date. Unless otherwise instructed by the Company at the direction of its Board of Directors, the Plan Administrator will acquire common Stock on behalf of Participants through open-market purchases if, on the distribution payment date, the Market Price is less than the most recently published NAV (such condition referred to as a market discount ). In the event of a market discount on the distribution payment date, the Plan Administrator will have until the last business day before the next date on which the common stock trades on an ex-distribution basis or after the distribution payment date, whichever is sooner (the last purchase date ), to invest the distribution amount in common stock acquired in open-market purchases. If shares are purchased in the open market with respect to a distribution, the number of shares to be credited to a Participant s account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the cash distribution otherwise payable to the Participant by the weighted average Market Price per share for all common stock purchased by the Plan Administrator in the open market. If the Plan Administrator is unable to invest the full distribution amount in open-market purchases, or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease making open-market purchases and may use any uninvested portion to acquire newly issued shares. Investments in newly issued shares made in this manner would be made pursuant to the same process described above and the date of issue for such newly issued shares will substitute for the distribution payment date. If the Company instructs the Plan Administrator to purchase new shares of common stock when there is a market discount, the shares of common stock will be acquired in accordance with the same terms as outlined above when there is a market premium. There will be no fees with respect to shares of common stock issued directly by the Company. However, each Participant will pay the per share fees (which include any applicable brokerage commissions the Plan Administrator is required to pay) incurred in connection with open-market purchases. If a shareholder has shares held by a broker, such shareholder should contact his/her broker to participate in the DRIP. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately million of cash distributions were reinvested for electing Participants through purchase of shares in the open market in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.

Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities and indebtedness of private U.S. companies, public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250.0 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. We are also permitted to make certain follow-on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition. As of September 30, 2024, 83.1 of our total assets were invested in qualifying assets. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold. We also generate revenue from dividends on our equity interests, capital gains on the disposition of investments, and certain lease, fee, and other income. Our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to five years, although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity. Interest on our debt investments is generally payable quarterly or semi-annually. Payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or PIK. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, origination, structuring or due diligence fees, end-of-term or exit fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance, consulting fees and other investment related income. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee and, depending on our operating results, incentive compensation, expenses reimbursable under the management agreement, administration fees and the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement. The base management fee and incentive compensation remunerates the Advisor for work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. Our administration agreement with the Administrator provides that the Administrator may be reimbursed for costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator for office space rental, office equipment and utilities allocable to us under the administration agreement, as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator or its affiliates relating to any non-investment advisory, administrative or operating services provided by the Administrator or its affiliates to us. We also bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions (and the Company s common shareholders indirectly bear all of the costs and expenses of the Company, SVCP, TCPC Funding II, the SBIC and Merger Sub), which may include those relating to: 
 our organization; 

calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

costs of future offerings of our common stock and other securities, if any; 

the base management fee and any incentive compensation; 

dividends and distributions on our preferred shares, if any, and common shares; 

administration fees payable under the administration agreement; 

fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

registration fees; 

listing fees; 

taxes; 

director fees and expenses;

Table of Contents 

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC; 

costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our shareholders, including printing costs; 

our fidelity bond; 

directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

indemnification payments; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit and legal costs; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us and the Administrator in connection with administering our business, such as the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement, including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs. 

Prior to the Closing, the investment management agreement provided that the base management fee be calculated at an annual rate of 1.5 of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) payable quarterly in arrears; provided, however, that, effective as of February 9, 2019, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.0 of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) that exceed an amount equal to 200 of the net asset value of the Company. For purposes of calculating the base management fee, total assets is determined without deduction for any borrowings or other liabilities. The base management fee is calculated based on the value of our total assets and net asset value (excluding cash and cash equivalents) at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. 
 In connection with the Merger, the Company and the Advisor entered into the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor reduced its base management fee rate for managing the Company from 1.50 to 1.25 on assets equal to or below 200 of the net asset value of the Company with no change to the basis of calculation. Prior to the Closing, the Advisor s base management fee rate for managing the Company was 1.50 on assets equal to or below 200 of the net asset value of the Company. The base management fee rate on assets that exceed 200 of the net asset value of the Company remains 1.00 . The Company also entered into the Fee Waiver Agreement with the Advisor. The Fee Waiver Agreement provided that the Advisor will waive all or a portion of its advisory fees to the extent the adjusted net investment income of the Company on a per share basis (determined by dividing the adjusted net investment income of the Company by the weighted average outstanding shares of the Company during the relevant quarter) is less than 0.32 per share in any of the first four (4) fiscal quarters ending after the Closing (the first of which will be the quarter in which the Closing occurred) to the extent there are sufficient advisory fees to cover such deficit (the waiver amount in a given quarter cannot exceed the total advisory fees for such quarter). 
 Additionally, the previous investment management agreement dated February 9, 2019 and the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement each provide that the Advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to incentive compensation under certain circumstances. According to the terms of such agreements, no incentive compensation was incurred prior to January 1, 2013. Under the previous investment management agreement, dated February 9, 2019, and as continued under the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement, the incentive compensation equals the sum of (1) 20 of all ordinary income since January 1, 2013 through February 8, 2019 and 17.5 thereafter and (2) 20 of all net realized capital gains (net of any net unrealized capital depreciation) since January 1, 2013 through February 8, 2019 and 17.5 thereafter, less ordinary income incentive compensation and capital gains incentive compensation previously paid. However, incentive compensation will only be paid to the extent the cumulative total return of the Company after incentive compensation and including such payment would equal or exceed a 7 annual return on daily weighted-average contributed common equity. The determination of incentive compensation is subject to limitations under the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the financial statements. In addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to our financial statements.

Valuation of portfolio investments 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 (the Rule under the 1940 Act, the Board of Directors designated the Advisor as the Company s valuation designee (the Valuation Designee to perform certain fair value functions, including performing fair value determinations and has approved policies and procedures adopted by the Advisor to seek to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Rules. 
 We value our portfolio investments at fair value based upon the principles and methods of valuation set forth in policies and procedures reviewed and approved by a committee established by the Valuation Designee (the "Valuation Committee"). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset that (i) are independent of us, (ii) are knowledgeable, having a reasonable understanding about the asset based on all available information (including information that might be obtained through due diligence efforts that are usual and customary), (iii) are able to transact for the asset, and (iv) are willing to transact for the asset or liability (that is, they are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so). 
 Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless the quotations are deemed not to represent fair value. We generally obtain market quotations from recognized exchanges, market quotation systems, independent pricing services or one or more broker-dealers or market makers. However, short term debt investments with original maturities of generally three months or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available, which is the case for many of our investments, or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, are valued at fair value using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with our documented valuation policies and procedures reviewed and approved by the Valuation Committee. The policies were adopted by the Valuation Designee and approved by the Board. Due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where we believe that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser, or the market for a particular security cause current market quotations to not reflect the fair value of the security. Examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale, where there is a forced sale by a distressed seller, where market quotations vary substantially among market makers, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread. 
 The valuation process adopted by the Valuation Designee with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value is as follows: 
 The investment professionals of the Valuation Designee provide recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms approved by the Valuation Committee. 

Such firms evaluate this information along with relevant observable market data to conduct independent appraisals each quarter, and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the Valuation Designee. 

The fair value of smaller investments comprising in the aggregate less than 5 of our total capitalization may be determined by the Valuation Designee in good faith in accordance with our valuation policy without the employment of an independent valuation firm. 

The Valuation Designee determines the fair value of the remainder of investments in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Valuation Committee and the respective independent valuation firms. 

Those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing one or more methodologies, including the market approach, the income approach, or in the case of recent investments, the cost approach, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that the Valuation Designee may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant and among other factors: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparable, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, merger and acquisition comparable, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values.

When valuing all of our investments, we strive to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, including assumptions about risk. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 
 Our investments may be categorized based on the types of inputs used in their valuation. The level in the GAAP valuation hierarchy in which an investment falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation of the investment in its entirety. Investments are classified by GAAP into the three broad levels as follows: 
 Level 1 Investments valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
 Level 2 Investments valued using other unadjusted observable market inputs, e.g. quoted prices in markets that are not active or quotes for comparable instruments. 
 Level 3 Investments that are valued using quotes and other observable market data to the extent available, but which also take into consideration one or more unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation taken as a whole. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 0.0 of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 1.5 were categorized as Level 2, 98.4 were categorized as Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by independent third-party sources, and 0.1 were categorized as Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by the Valuation Designee. 
 As of December 31, 2023, 0.0 of our investments were categorized as Level 1, 3.0 were categorized as Level 2, 96.9 were categorized as Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by independent third-party sources, and 0.1 were categorized as Level 3 investments valued based on valuations by the Valuation Designee. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on the financial statements. 
 Revenue recognition 
 Interest and dividend income, including income paid in kind, is recorded on an accrual basis, when such amounts are considered collectible. Origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees, including original issue discounts, earned with respect to capital commitments are generally amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment, as are end-of-term or exit fees receivable upon repayment of a debt investment. Other fees, including certain amendment fees, prepayment fees and commitment fees on broken deals, are recognized as earned. Prepayment fees and similar income due upon the early repayment of a loan or debt security are recognized when earned and are included in interest income. 
 Certain of our debt investments are purchased at a discount to par as a result of the underlying credit risks and financial results of the issuer, as well as general market factors that influence the financial markets as a whole. Discounts on the acquisition of corporate bonds are generally amortized using the effective-interest or constant-yield method assuming there are no questions as to collectability. When principal payments on a loan are received in an amount in excess of the loan s amortized cost, the excess principal payments are recorded as interest income. 
 Debt investments are generally placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal or interest will not be collected according to the contractual terms. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, accrued and unpaid interest (including any accrued PIK interest) is generally reversed, and discount accretion or premium amortization is discontinued. The Company does not reverse previously capitalized PIK income. Payments received on non-accrual investments may either be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon the Company s judgment regarding collectability of the outstanding principal and interest. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid or, in the Company s judgment, the repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected. The Company may opt not to place a distressed debt investment on non-accrual status if principal and interest are secured through sufficient collateral value and are in the process of collection through legal actions or other efforts that are expected to result in repayment of principal and interest.

Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

 Results of operations 
 Investment income 
 Investment income totaled 70.9 million and 54.2 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of which 69.2 million and 53.3 million were attributable to interest and fees on our debt investments, 1.6 million and 0.9 million to dividend income and 0.1 million and 0.0 million to other income, respectively. Included in interest and fees on our debt investments were 6.7 million and 0.7 million of non-recurring income related to prepayments and 0.5 million and 0.4 million in amendment fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects an increase in interest income due to additional investment income earned on investments acquired as a result of the Merger and higher SOFR rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investment income totaled 198.2 million and 158.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of which 193.0 million and 155.3 million were attributable to interest and fees on our debt investments, 5.1 million and 2.8 million to dividend income and 0.1 million and 0.4 million to other income, respectively.

income due to additional investment income earned on investments acquired as a result of the Merger and higher SOFR rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Expenses 
 Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 37.1 million and 25.9 million, respectively, comprised of 21.2 million and 12.1 million in interest expense and related fees, 6.5 million and 6.0 million in incentive fee expense, 6.2 million and 6.1 million in base management fees, 0.8 million and 0.7 million in professional fees, 0.5 million and 0.4 million in administrative expenses and 1.9 million and 0.6 million in other expenses, respectively. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects an increase in interest expense as a result of the higher debt outstanding assumed as a result of the Merger and the issuance of the 2029 Notes and due to higher SOFR rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to an increase in incentive fee expense from higher pre-incentive net investment income earned during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 100.2 million and 77.1 million, respectively, comprised of 54.1 million and 36.0 million in interest expense and related fees, 19.2 million and 17.3 million in incentive fee expense, 18.6 million and 18.1 million in base management fees, 2.4 million and 1.5 million in professional fees, 1.7 million and 1.1 million in administrative expenses and 4.2 million and 3.1 million in other expenses, respectively. The increase in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects an increase in interest expense as a result of the higher debt outstanding assumed as a result of the Merger and the issuance of the 2029 Notes and due to higher SOFR rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in addition to an increase in incentive fee expense from higher pre-incentive net investment income earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net investment income 
 Net investment income was 33.9 million and 28.3 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects the increase in total investment income, partially offset by the increase in expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net investment income was 98.0 million and 81.3 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increase in net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects the increase in total investment income, partially offset by the increase in expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net realized and unrealized gain or loss 
 Net realized gain (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (31.4) million and (0.1) million, respectively. Net realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of 24.1 million and 7.4 million in losses from the restructuring of our investments in Pluralsight and McAfee, respectively. Subsequent to its restructuring, our debt investment in Pluralsight is back on accrual status. 
 Net realized gain (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (67.1) million and (31.2) million, respectively. Net realized losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of 24.1 million, 22.8 million, 12.6 million and 7.4 million in losses from the restructuring of our investments in Pluralsight, Thras.io, Hylan and McAfee, respectively. Net realized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised primarily of a 30.7 million loss from reorganization of our investment in AutoAlert. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) was 19.2 million and (15.4) million, respectively. The change in net unrealized appreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects 24.1 million and 7.6 million reversals of previous unrealized losses from the restructuring of our investments in Pluralsight and McAfee, respectively, a 4.2 million unrealized gain on our investment in Securus, a 3.6 million unrealized gain on our investment in Domo and other unrealized gains across the portfolio, partially offset by an 8.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Gordon Brothers, a 4.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Seller-X, a 3.3 million unrealized loss on our investment in InMoment, a 2.8 million unrealized loss on our investment in Edmentum and a 2.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in Alpine. The change in net unrealized depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects a 4.5 million unrealized loss on our investment in Edmentum, a 4.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in Khoros, a 3.6 million unrealized loss on our investment in Magenta Buyer, a 2.5 million unrealized loss on our investment in 36th Street Capital, a 2.4 million unrealized loss on our investment in Hylan, and a 2.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in CIBT, offset by a 3.2 million unrealized gain on our investment in Astra Acquisition.

Table of Contents 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) was (55.4) million and 1.6 million, respectively. The change in unrealized depreciation of (55.4) million is net of 21.3 million in unrealized appreciation resulting from a reduction of the cost basis of investments acquired as a result of the Merger from allocation of the purchase discount paid by the Company. The change in net unrealized depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects a 35.4 million unrealized loss on our investment in Seller-X, a 20.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in Edmentum, a 14.7 million unrealized loss on our investment in Lithium, a 13.3 million unrealized loss on our investment in Razor, and a 7.2 million unrealized loss on our investment in Gordon Brothers, partially offset by 17.0 million, 10.7 million, 6.3 million, and 5.2 million reversals of previous unrealized losses from the restructuring of our investments in Thras.io, Hylan, Perch and McAfee, respectively. The change in net unrealized appreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects a 37.0 million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses from the reorganization of our investment in Autoalert, offset by a 8.0 million unrealized loss in Hylan, a 6.8 million unrealized loss on our investment in Magenta Buyer, a 5.3 million unrealized loss on our investment in 36th Street, a 5.1 million unrealized loss on our investment in Khoros, a 4.4 million unrealized loss on our investment in Edmentum, a 3.9 million unrealized loss on our investment in Astra Acquisition, and a 3.9 million unrealized loss on our investment in Perch. 
 Incentive compensation 
 Incentive fees, included in operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 6.5 million and 6.0 million, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 19.2 million and 17.3 million, respectively, and were each payable due to our performance exceeding the cumulative total return threshold during those periods. The increase in incentive fee expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was the result of higher pre-incentive fee net investment income earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 which was driven by higher SOFR rates and additional investment income earned on investments acquired as a result of the Merger. 
 Income tax expense, including excise tax 
 The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, timely distribute to its shareholders generally at least 90 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its shareholders which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4 excise tax on such income. Any excise tax expense is recorded at year end as such amounts are known. No excise tax was incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced Merger with BCIC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, BCIC was merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company and as a subsidiary of SVCP. The Merger was considered a tax-free reorganization and the Company has elected to carry forward the historical cost basis of the acquired BCIC investments for tax purposes. As a result of the Merger, BCIC s separate existence ceased. 
 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 
 The net increase (decrease) in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations was 21.6 million and 12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net assets resulting from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher net investment income and lower net realized and unrealized losses compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The net increase (decrease) in net assets applicable to common shareholders resulting from operations was (24.6) million and 51.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net assets resulting from operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher net realized and unrealized losses, partially offset by higher net investment income compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net investment income, net realized and unrealized gain (loss) and net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including acquisitions, the level of new investment commitments, the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio.

Supplemental Non-GAAP information 
 On March 18, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced Merger with BCIC. The Merger has been accounted for as an asset acquisition of BCIC by the Company in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50 ("ASC 805"), Business Combinations-Related Issues. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former BCIC shareholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Merger under ASC 805. The consideration paid to BCIC shareholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the purchase discount ). The consideration paid was allocated to the individual BCIC assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than non-qualifying assets and liabilities (for example, cash) and did not give rise to goodwill. As a result, the purchase discount was allocated to the cost basis of the BCIC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the effective time of the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the investments were marked to their respective fair values in accordance with ASC 820 which resulted in immediate recognition of net unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of the Merger. The purchase discount allocated to the BCIC debt investments acquired will amortize over the remaining life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation or depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to BCIC equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company may recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. 
 As a supplement to the Company s reported GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful: 
 Adjusted net investment income excludes the amortization of purchase accounting discount from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP; 

Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss) excludes the unrealized appreciation resulting from the purchase discount and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation from the amortization of the purchase discount from the determination of net realized and unrealized gain (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and 

Adjusted net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations calculates net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations based on Adjusted net investment income and Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain (loss).

We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of purchase discount accounting under ASC 805 from these financial measures is meaningful because of the potential impact on the comparability of these financial measures that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations period over period. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Since our inception, our liquidity and capital resources have been generated primarily through the initial private placement of common shares of Special Value Continuation Fund, LLC (the predecessor entity) which were subsequently converted to common stock of the Company, the net proceeds from the initial and secondary public offerings of our common stock, amounts outstanding under our Leverage Program, and cash flows from operations, including investments sales and repayments and income earned from investments and cash equivalents. The primary uses of cash have been investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our equity holders, payments to service our Leverage Program and other general corporate purposes. 
 On February 27, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new dividend reinvestment plan (the DRIP for the Company. The DRIP was effective as of, and will apply to the reinvestment of cash distributions with a record date after March 18, 2024. Under the DRIP, shareholders will automatically receive cash dividends and distributions unless they opt in to the DRIP and elect to have their dividends and distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the former shareholders of BCIC that participated in the BCIC dividend reinvestment plan at the time of the Merger have been automatically enrolled in the Company s DRIP and will have their shares reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock on future distributions, unless they opt out of the DRIP. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 1.5 million of cash distributions were reinvested for electing Participants through purchase of shares in the open market in accordance with the terms of the DRIP. 
 On February 24, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan (the Company Repurchase Plan to acquire up to 50.0 million in the aggregate of the Company s common stock at prices at certain thresholds below the Company s net asset value per share, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the 1934 Act. The Company Repurchase Plan is designed to allow the Company to repurchase its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws. The Company Repurchase Plan requires an agent selected by the Company to repurchase shares of common stock on the Company s behalf if and when the market price per share is at certain thresholds below the most recently reported net asset value per share. Under the plan, the agent will increase the volume of purchases made if the price of the Company s common stock declines, subject to volume restrictions. The timing and amount of any stock repurchased depends on the terms and conditions of the Company Repurchase Plan, the market price of the common stock and trading volumes, and no assurance can be given that any 
 78

particular amount of common stock will be repurchased. The Company Repurchase Plan was re-approved on August 1, 2024, to be in effect through the earlier of April 30, 2025, unless further extended or terminated by our Board of Directors, or such time as the approved 50.0 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions. No shares were repurchased by the Company under the Company Repurchase plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

(1) Except for the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes, all carrying values are the same as the principal amounts outstanding. 

(2) As of September 30, 2024, 113.0 million of the outstanding amount was subject to a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.11 . 8.3 million of the outstanding amount bore interest at a rate of EURIBOR + 2.00 . 

(3) Operating Facility includes a 100.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to 400.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions. 

(4) Subject to certain funding requirements and a SOFR credit adjustment of 0.15 . 

(5) Funding Facility II includes a 50.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to 250.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions. 

(6) Debt assumed by the Company as a result of the Merger with BCIC. 

(7) The applicable margin for SOFR-based borrowings could be either 1.75 or 2.00 depending on a ratio of the borrowing base to certain committed indebtedness, and is also subject to a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 . If Merger Sub elects to borrow based on the alternate base rate, the applicable margin could be either 0.75 or 1.00 depending on a ratio of the borrowing base to certain committed indebtedness. 

(8) Merger Sub Facility includes a 60.0 million accordion which allows for expansion of the facility to up to 325.0 million subject to consent from the lender and other customary conditions. 

(9) Weighted-average interest rate, excluding fees of 0.35 or 0.36 . 

(10) The 2025 Notes consist of two tranches: 35.0 million aggregate principal amount with a fixed interest rate of 6.85 and 57.0 million aggregate principal amount bearing interest at a rate equal to SOFR plus 3.14 . 

Under Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, prior to March 23, 2018, a BDC was generally not permitted to issue senior securities unless after giving effect thereto the BDC met a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which includes all borrowings of the BDC, of at least 200 . On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act SBCAA was signed into law, which among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to have a ratio of total outstanding indebtedness to common equity of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200 asset coverage requirement. 
 Effective November 7, 2018, the Company s Board of Directors, including a required majority (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our Board of Directors, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA (the Asset Coverage Ratio Election ), which would have resulted (had the Company not received earlier shareholder approval) in our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities being reduced from 200 to 150 , effective on November 7, 2019. On February 8, 2019, the shareholders of the Company approved the Asset Coverage Ratio Election, and, as a result, effective on February 9, 2019, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities was reduced from 200 to 150 . As of September 30, 2024, the Company s asset coverage ratio was 183.2 . 
 On July 13, 2015, we obtained exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude debt outstanding under the SBA Debentures from our asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the 150 asset coverage test by permitting the SBIC to borrow up to 141.5 million more than it would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 221.5 million, consisting primarily of 84.8 million in net investment income (net of non-cash income and expenses) and the settlement of dispositions of investments (net of acquisitions) of 136.7 million. 
 Net cash used by financing activities was 229.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of a 250.0 million repayment of the 2024 Notes, 208.3 million in net credit facility repayments, 85.1 million in dividends paid to common shareholders (including 7.3 million of dividends declared by BCIC prior to the Merger and paid to former BCIC shareholders 
 79 

Table of Contents 

out of cash and cash equivalents acquired) and 7.5 million in payments of associated debt issuance costs, offset by 321.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes . 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 104.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. 
 The Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and Merger Sub Facility (in the aggregate) are secured by substantially all of the assets in our portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, and are subject to compliance with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including the maintenance of a minimum shareholders equity, the maintenance of a ratio of not less than 150 of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness, and restrictions on certain payments and issuance of debt. Unfavorable economic conditions may result in a decrease in the value of our investments, which would affect both the asset coverage ratios and the value of the collateral securing the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and Merger Sub Facility, and may therefore impact our ability to borrow under the Operating Facility, Funding Facility II and Merger Sub Facility. In addition to regulatory restrictions that restrict our ability to raise capital, the Leverage Program contains various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment of debt, thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial and operational covenants required by the Leverage Program. 
 Unfavorable economic conditions, while potentially creating attractive opportunities for us, may decrease liquidity and raise the cost of capital generally, which could limit our ability to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program on terms as favorable as are currently included therein. If we are unable to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program upon the various dates of maturity, we expect to have sufficient funds to repay the outstanding balances in full from our net investment income and sales of, and repayments of principal from, our portfolio company investments, as well as from anticipated debt and equity capital raises, among other sources. Unfavorable economic conditions may limit our ability to raise capital or the ability of the companies in which we invest to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event, such as a sale, recapitalization or initial public offering. The Operating Facility, Funding Facility II, Merger Sub Facility, the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes, mature in August 2029, August 2027, September 2028, December 2025, February 2026 and May 2029, respectively. Any inability to renew, extend or replace the Leverage Program could adversely impact our liquidity and ability to find new investments or maintain distributions to our shareholders. 
 Challenges in the market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the Code and the 1940 Act. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must satisfy, among other requirements, an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least 90 of our ordinary income and short-term capital gains to our shareholders. Because we are required to distribute our income in this manner, and because the illiquidity of many of our investments may make it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments, our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing. While we anticipate being able to continue to satisfy all covenants and repay the outstanding balances under the Leverage Program when due, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so, which could lead to an event of default.

 In addition to obligations under our Leverage Program, we have entered into several contracts under which we have future commitments. Pursuant to an investment management agreement, the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Payments under the investment management agreement are equal to a percentage of the value of our total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) and an incentive compensation, plus reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by the Advisor. Under our administration agreement, the Administrator provides us with administrative services, facilities and personnel. Payments under the administration agreement are equal to an allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations to us and may include rent and our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs. We are responsible for reimbursing the Advisor for due diligence and negotiation expenses, fees and expenses of custodians, administrators, transfer and distribution agents, counsel and directors, insurance, filings and registrations, proxy expenses, expenses of communications to investors, compliance expenses, interest, taxes, portfolio transaction expenses, costs of responding to regulatory inquiries and reporting to regulatory authorities, costs and expenses of preparing and maintaining our books and records, indemnification, litigation and other extraordinary expenses and such other expenses as are approved by the directors as being reasonably related to our organization, offering, capitalization, operation or administration and any portfolio investments, as applicable. The Advisor is not responsible for any of the foregoing expenses and such services are not investment advisory services under the 1940 Act. Either party may terminate each of the investment management agreement and administration agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days written notice to the other. 
 Distributions 
 Our quarterly dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions are declared considering our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to shareholders and the amount of taxable income carried over from the prior year for distribution in the current year. We do not have a policy to pay distributions at a specific level and expect to continue to distribute substantially all of our taxable income. We cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.

(1) No dividend reinvestment plan was effective for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

In addition, the Company paid 7.3 million of dividends payable assumed in the Merger that were declared on March 4, 2024 by the BCIC Board of Directors for the benefit of former BCIC shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024. Such amount was paid from BCIC cash and cash equivalents acquired by the Company in the Merger. 
 
 We have elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. In order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on RICs, we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 

98.2 of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year; and 

certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. 

We may, at our discretion, carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a 4 excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, all other things being equal, this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our shareholders. We will accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required. In addition, although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time. Also, we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in our existing and future credit facilities. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of favorable RIC tax treatment. In addition, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC and may be subject to an excise tax. 
 In order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash. As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Related Parties 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 Each of the Company, TCPC Funding II, and the SBIC has entered into an investment management agreement with the Advisor. 

The Administrator provides us with administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. For providing these services, facilities and personnel, the Administrator may be reimbursed by us for expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our officers and the Administrator s administrative staff and providing, at our request and on our behalf, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. The Administrator is an affiliate of the Advisor and certain other series and classes of SVOF/MM, LLC serve as the general partner or managing member of certain other funds managed by the Advisor. 

We have entered into a royalty-free license agreement with BlackRock and the Advisor, pursuant to which each of BlackRock and the Advisor has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "BlackRock" and "TCP." 

The Advisor and its affiliates, employees and associates currently do and in the future may manage other funds and accounts. The Advisor and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds or accounts. Accordingly, conflicts may arise regarding the allocation of investments or opportunities among us and those accounts. In general, the Advisor will allocate investment opportunities pro rata among us and the other funds and accounts (assuming the investment satisfies the objectives of each) based on the amount of committed capital each then has available. The allocation of certain investment opportunities in private placements is subject to independent director approval pursuant to the terms of the co-investment exemptive order applicable to us. In certain cases, investment opportunities may be made other than on a pro rata basis. For example, we may desire to retain an asset at the same time that one or more other funds or accounts desire to sell it or we may not have additional capital to invest at a time the other funds or accounts do. If the Advisor is unable to manage our investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective. In addition, the Advisor may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and certain other entities that could impact our investment returns. While our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted under the 1940 Act, we have received an exemptive order from the SEC permitting certain affiliated investments subject to certain conditions. As a result, we may face conflict of interests and investments made pursuant to the exemptive order conditions which could in certain circumstances affect adversely the price paid or received by us or the availability or size of the position purchased or sold by us. 
 Recent Developments 
 From October 1, 2024 through November 5, 2024, the Company has invested approximately 29.5 million primarily in two senior secured loans with a combined effective yield of approximately 10.7 . 
 On October 30, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors re-approved the Company Repurchase Plan, to be in effect through the earlier of two trading days after the Company s fourth quarter 2024 earnings release or such time as the approved 50 million repurchase amount has been fully utilized, subject to certain conditions. 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter regular dividend of 0.34 per share and a special dividend of 0.10 per share, both payable on December 31, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qu alitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 92.7 of debt investments in our portfolio bore interest based on floating rates, such as SOFR, EURIBOR, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months. At December 31, 2023, the percentage of floating rate debt investments in our portfolio that were subject to an interest rate floor was 95.6 . Floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor. 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. We assess our portfolio companies periodically to determine whether such companies will be able to continue making interest payments in the event that interest rates increase. There can be no assurances that the portfolio companies will be able to meet their contractual obligations at any or all levels of increases in interest rates. 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 statement of assets and liabilities, the following table shows the annual impact on net investment income (excluding the related incentive compensation impact) of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments and the fact that our assets and liabilities may not have the same base rate period as assumed in this table) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure. Projected amounts in the table do not include the impact of interest rate changes on the Company's Interest Rate Swap.

Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the period covered by this report, we, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II - O ther Information. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, the Company and the Advisor may be parties to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business, including with respect to our investments in our portfolio companies. On September 13, 2023, the Company was named as a defendant, together with the Advisor and certain other funds managed by the Advisor, as well as certain other defendants, in a lawsuit filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit relates to a third-party sponsored collateralized loan obligation in which the Company and certain other defendants invested. The suit alleges that the Company and the other defendants knew or should have known of certain fraudulent activities of the third-party manager relating to its management of the collateralized loan obligation that caused the plaintiffs to suffer investment losses. The suit seeks to recover from the Company approximately 15 million, plus interest, additional amounts from the other defendants, and attorneys fees and costs from all defendants. The Company, the affiliated funds and the Advisor intend to vigorously defend against these claims and filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on November 6, 2023, which was argued in court on March 6, 2024, and which remains pending. At this time, however, the Company and the Advisor cannot predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome, including any potential losses that could result.
