Level 3 inputs include discount rates that would be used by a market participant in valuing these assets and liabilities, projections of revenues and cash flows, distributor attrition rates, royalty rates, and market comparables, among others. The fair value of work-in-process and finished goods inventory was determined using the comparative sales method and raw materials was determined using the replacement cost method.

 (a) Percentage points pp ). 
 
 Sales - Sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 161,461, a decrease of 24 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, which was the result of decreased sales in each segment. Within the Distilling Solutions segment, sales were down 36 percent due to decreased sales of white goods and other co-products in connection with the December 2023 closure of our distillery located in Atchison, Kansas (the Atchison Distillery ), as well as decreased brown goods sales. Within the Ingredient Solutions segment, sales were down 18 percent, due to decreased sales of specialty wheat proteins, commodity wheat starches, and specialty wheat starches. Within the Branded Spirits segment, sales were down 6 percent, primarily due to decreased sales of brands in the mid and value price tiers (see Segment Results ). 
 
 Gross profit - Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 65,815, a decrease of 10 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.

 SG A expenses - SG A expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were 17,204, a decrease of 20 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. The decrease in SG A expenses was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expenses. 
 22 

Operating income - Operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased to 32,564 from 19,839 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of the 2023 impairment of long-lived assets and other expenses of 18,334 related to the closure of the Atchison Distillery that did not recur during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, the increase in operating income was due to the lower SG A expenses and the increase in gross profit in the Branded Spirits segment. These increases were partially offset by decreases in gross profit in the Ingredient Solutions and Distilling Solutions segments.

 Total sales of the Distilling Solutions segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 39,934, or 36 percent, compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease in sales of the Distilling Solutions segment is primarily related to the decrease in sales volume of white goods and other co-products, which was due to the closure of the Atchison Distillery during December 2023. Sales of brown goods decreased primarily due to a decrease in net price/mix and decreased sales volume (as defined in the table above). The brown goods decline was primarily the result of softening American whiskey category trends and elevated industry-wide barrel inventories, leading to instances of customer contract non-performance that put pressure on our brown goods business with a larger impact on our smaller, craft customer base. We expect these trends to continue, which may impact our future results of operations. 
 
 Gross profit decreased quarter versus quarter by 4,636, or 14 percent. Gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased to 39.8 percent from 29.8 percent for the prior year quarter. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in brown goods sales due to decreases in net price/mix and sales volumes of brown goods, partially offset by lower average unit costs. This was partially offset by the positive impact the closure of the Atchison Distillery had on white goods and other co-products gross profit.

 Total sales of the Branded Spirits segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 4,195, or 6 percent, compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by a decrease in the sales of brands within the mid, value, and other price tiers, partially offset by an increase in sales of the premium plus price tier. The decrease in sales of brands within the mid and value price tiers was driven by lower sales volumes, as we increased pricing on certain lower margin mid and value brands. 
 
 Gross profit increased quarter versus quarter by 3,406, or 12 percent. Gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased to 51.8 percent from 43.5 percent for the prior year quarter.

 (d) Percentage points pp ). 
 
 Total sales of the Ingredient Solutions segment for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 6,034, or 18 percent, compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales volume of specialty wheat proteins primarily due to continued export market headwinds. The decrease was also driven by decreased sales volume of commodity wheat starches due to increased domestic competition. 
 Gross profit decreased quarter versus quarter by 6,403, or 58 percent. Gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 17.6 percent from 33.8 percent for the prior year quarter. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by increased input costs primarily due to the removal of the intercompany credit for the waste starch slurry by-product since the closure of the Atchison Distillery, as well as other costs incurred to ready the waste starch for commercial sale. Additionally, the decrease in gross profit was attributable to decreased sales volume of specialty wheat proteins.

 (d) Percentage points pp ). 
 
 Total sales of the Ingredient Solutions segment for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2,517, or 3 percent, compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by decreased net price/mix across all product categories, as well as a decrease in sales volume of specialty wheat protein primarily due to continued export market headwinds. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales volume of specialty wheat starches. 
 Gross profit decreased by 16,914, or 48 percent for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. Gross margin for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 18.8 percent from 35.5 percent for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by higher input costs associated with the removal of the intercompany credit for the waste starch slurry by-product since the closure of the Atchison Distillery, as well as other costs incurred to ready the waste starch for commercial sale. Additionally, we incurred incremental costs for the new extrusion manufacturing facility during the year to date period. The decrease in gross profit was also attributable to decreased sales volume of specialty wheat proteins.

CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate adequate cash from operations while having ready access to capital at competitive rates. 
 
 Operating cash flow and borrowings through our Credit Agreement, Convertible Senior Notes, and Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 5, Corporate Borrowings) provide the primary sources of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. These same sources of cash are used to fund stockholder dividends and other discretionary uses. Our overall liquidity reflects our strong business results and an effective cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations. We expect our sources of cash to be adequate to provide for budgeted capital expenditures, potential mergers or acquisitions, and anticipated operating requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. 
 
 Cash Flow Summary Year to Date Ended September 30, Changes, year versus year Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 73,512 48,605 24,907 Net cash used in investing activities (53,126) (146,690) 93,564 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (18,048) 78,193 (96,241) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 46 33 13 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,384 (19,859) 22,243 
 
 Cash increased 2,384 for the year to date ended September 30, 2024, compared to a decrease of 19,859 for the year to date ended September 30, 2023, for a net increase in cash of 22,243, period versus period. 
 
 Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was 73,512. The cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income of 76,463, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of 32,845, including depreciation and amortization, the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and share-based compensation, partially offset by cash used in operating assets and liabilities of 35,796. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were 24,979 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, primarily due to an increase in barreled distillate, 10,627 use of cash related to a decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments, 9,935 related to accrued expenses and other, which related to a decrease in our incentive compensation accrual, partially offset by 13,979 cash provided by decreased accounts receivables, net, due to the timing of sales and customer payments during the year to date period as well as the closure of the Atchison Distillery in December 2023. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2023 was 48,605. The cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income of 76,084, adjustments for non-cash or non-operating charges of 42,912, including impairment of long-lived assets and other, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and the change in fair value of contingent consideration, partially offset by cash used in operating assets and liabilities, net of the effects of acquisition, of 70,391. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities were 42,015 use of cash related to an increase in inventories, primarily due to an increase in barreled distillate, 14,980 use of cash related to increased accounts receivable, net, due to timing of sales and customer payments during the quarter, and 10,069 use of cash related to a decrease in accounts payable due to timing of payments. 
 
 Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was 53,126, which primarily resulted from additions to property, plant, and equipment of 52,850 (see Capital Spending ). Cash used in investing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2023 was 146,690, which primarily resulted from 103,712 related to the acquisition of Penelope, net of cash acquired, and additions to property, plant, and equipment of 42,062 (see Capital Spending ). 
 
 Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans. We have incurred 43,503 and 36,879 of capital expenditures and have paid 52,850 and 42,062 for capital expenditures for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between the amount of capital expenditures incurred and amount paid is due to the change in capital expenditures in accounts payable. We expect approximately 78,000 in capital expenditures in 2024, which includes capital expenditures for facility improvement and expansion, facility sustaining projects, and environmental health and safety projects. 
 
 32 

Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 was 18,048, due to repurchases of Common Stock of 12,235 (see Treasury Purchases and Share Repurchase ), and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of 8,013 (see Dividends and Dividend Equivalents ), partially offset by net proceeds on debt of 2,200 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt ). 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities for the year to date ended September 30, 2023 was 78,193, due to net proceeds on debt of 87,000 (see Long-Term and Short-Term Debt ), partially offset by payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of 8,006 (see Dividends and Dividend Equivalents ), and repurchase of Common Stock of 801 (see Treasury Purchases ). 
 
 Treasury Purchases. 81,942 RSUs vested and converted to shares of Common Stock for employees during the year to date ended September 30, 2024, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 25,521 shares valued at 2,185 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes. 
 
 22,592 RSUs vested and converted to shares of Common Stock for employees during the year to date ended September 30, 2023, of which we withheld and purchased for treasury 8,437 shares valued at 801 to cover payment of associated withholding taxes. 
 
 Share Repurchase. On February 29, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 100,000 share repurchase program. Under the share repurchase program, we can repurchase Common Stock from time to time for cash in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time by the Company without prior notice. During the year to date ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 128,360 shares of Common Stock for approximately 10,000, resulting in approximately 90,000 remaining under the share repurchase program.

 On October 31, 2024, we announced a dividend payable to stockholders of record of our Common Stock, resulting in dividend equivalents payable to RSU holders, of 0.12 per share and per RSU. The dividend and dividend equivalent are payable on November 29, 2024 to stockholders of record and RSU holders on November 15, 2024. 
 
 Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including brand development, merger and acquisition, and share repurchase activities), and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was 289,968 (net of unamortized loan fees of 6,082) at September 30, 2024, and 287,249 (net of unamortized loan fees of 6,601) at December 31, 2023. 
 
 33 

Financial Condition and Liquidity. Our principal uses of cash in the ordinary course of business are for input costs used in our production processes, salaries, capital expenditures, and investments supporting our strategic plan, such as the aging of barreled distillate and potential mergers and acquisitions. Generally, during periods when commodities prices are rising, our operations require increased use of cash to support inventory levels. 
 
 Our principal sources of cash are product sales and borrowing on our various debt agreements. Under our debt agreements, we must meet certain financial covenants and restrictions, and at September 30, 2024, we met those covenants and restrictions. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by 449,670, largely due to our inventories, at cost, of 372,153. At September 30, 2024, our cash balance was 20,772 and we have used our various debt agreements for liquidity purposes, with 330,000 available under our Credit Agreement for additional borrowings and 225,200 available under the Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 5, Corporate Borrowings). We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We regularly assess our cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. We utilize short-term and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as capital investments, dividend payments, and potential mergers and acquisitions. Subject to market conditions, we could also fund future mergers and acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock. In addition, we have strong operating results such that we believe financial institutions should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements, if needed. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets with the goal to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Commodity Costs. Certain commodities we use in our production process, or input costs, expose us to market price risk due to volatility in the prices for those commodities. Through our grain supply contracts for our Lawrenceburg facility, our wheat flour supply contract for our Atchison facility, and our natural gas contracts for both facilities, we purchase grain, wheat flour, and natural gas, respectively, for delivery from one to 24 months into the future at negotiated prices. We have determined that the firm commitments to purchase grain, wheat flour, and natural gas under the terms of our supply contracts meet the normal purchases and sales exception as defined under Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging , because the quantities involved are for amounts to be consumed within the normal expected production process. 
 
 Interest Rate Exposures. Our various debt agreements (see Note 5, Corporate Borrowings) expose us to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates. Established procedures and internal processes govern the management of this market risk. 
 
 Increases in market interest rates would cause interest expense under our variable interest rate debt to increase and earnings before income taxes to decrease. The change in interest expense and earnings before income taxes would be dependent upon the weighted average outstanding borrowings under variable interest rate debt during the reporting period following an increase in market interest rates. Based on weighted average outstanding variable-rate borrowings at September 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase over the current rates actually in effect at such date would increase our interest expense on an annual basis by 700. Based on weighted average outstanding fixed-rate borrowings at September 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in market rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate debt of 22,927, and a 100 basis point decrease in market rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate debt of 9,172. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
