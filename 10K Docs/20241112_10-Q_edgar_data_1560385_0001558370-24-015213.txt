The Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and the Reclassification are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements on a prospective basis. While the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a public company, such as Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, the Liberty Live Group. Holders of tracking stock are also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation. The Liberty Formula One common stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Formula One Group, which as of September 30, 2024, include Liberty s interests in Formula 1 and QuintEvents, cash and Liberty s Convertible Senior Notes due 2027. As of September 30, 2024, the Formula One Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million, which included million of subsidiary cash. The Liberty Live common stock is intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty Live Group. As of September 30, 2024, the Liberty Live Group is comprised of Liberty s interest in Live Nation, cash, other minority investments , Liberty s Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050, Liberty s Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2053 and an undrawn margin loan. Prior to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, the Liberty SiriusXM common stock was intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. At the time of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, the Liberty SiriusXM Group was comprised of Liberty s interest in Sirius XM Holdings, corporate cash, Liberty s Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, Liberty s Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2049 and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. As disclosed in note 1, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is presented as a discontinued operation in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 (a) Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS during periods in which losses are reported since the result would be antidilutive. (b) The Liberty SiriusXM Group s intergroup interest in the Formula One Group was settled and extinguished on July 12, 2023. The intergroup interest was a quasi-equity interest which was not represented by outstanding shares of common stock; rather, the Liberty SiriusXM Group had an attributed value in the Formula One Group which was generally stated in terms of a number of shares of stock issuable to the Liberty SiriusXM Group with respect to its interest in the Formula One Group. Each reporting period, the notional shares representing the intergroup interest were marked to fair value. As the notional shares underlying the intergroup interest were not represented by outstanding shares of common stock, such shares had not been officially designated Series A, B or C Liberty Formula One common stock. However, Liberty assumed that the notional shares (if and when issued) would be comprised of Series A Liberty Formula One common stock since Series A Liberty Formula One common stock was underlying the Cash Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. Therefore, the market price of Series A Liberty Formula One common stock was used for the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment through the unaudited attributed condensed consolidated statements of operations. The notional shares representing the intergroup interest had no impact on the basic WASO. However, if dilutive, the notional shares representing the intergroup interest were included in the diluted WASO as if the shares had been issued and outstanding during the period. For periods in which share settlement of the intergroup interest was dilutive, an adjustment was also made to the numerator in the diluted

(a) Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS during periods in which losses are reported since the result would be antidilutive . Debt and equity securities Financial instrument assets Debt The majority of Liberty's Level 2 financial instruments are debt related instruments and derivative instruments, which include foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. These assets and liabilities are not always traded publicly or not considered to be traded on "active markets," as defined in GAAP. The fair values for such instruments are derived from a typical model using observable market data as the significant inputs or a trading price of a similar asset or liability is utilized. Accordingly, those debt securities, financial instruments and debt or debt related instruments are reported in the foregoing table as Level 2 fair value. As of December 31, 2023, debt and equity securities included in the table above are included in the Other assets line item in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

(a) The Company elected to account for its exchangeable senior debentures and convertible notes (as described in note 8) using the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of the exchangeable senior debentures and convertible notes recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable. The Company isolates the portion of the unrealized gain (loss) attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risk and recognizes such amount in other comprehensive earnings (loss). The change in the fair value of the exchangeable senior debentures and convertible notes attributable to changes in the instrument specific credit risk was a loss of million and gain of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a loss of million and gain of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 outstanding borrowings under the million revolving credit facility. The margin for the Term Loan B, originally set at , stepped down to effective May 5, 2023, after a certain leverage test was met as of March 31, 2023.

On September 19, 2024, the margin for the Term Loan B was reduced to , with the potential to permanently step down to if a certain leverage test is met on or after the earlier of the acquisition of Dorna or the termination of the Dorna acquisition. The margin for the Term Loan A and revolving credit facility is between and depending on leverage ratios, amongst other things, and was fixed at for the first year and reduced to effective November 24, 2023.

 Other Corporate and other Intergroup elimination ) ) Total Formula One Group Braves Group Corporate and other: Baseball NA NA Mixed-Use Development NA NA Total Braves Group NA NA Consolidated Liberty Our subsidiaries customers generally pay for services in advance of the performance obligation and therefore these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is recognized as revenue in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations as the services are provided. The opening and closing balances for our deferred revenue related to Formula 1 and other subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately million and million, respectively. The primary cause for the increase related to the receipt of cash from our customers in advance of satisfying our performance obligations. Significant portions of the transaction prices for Formula 1 and other subsidiaries are related to undelivered performance obligations that are under contractual arrangements that extend beyond one year. The Company anticipates recognizing revenue from the delivery of such performance obligations of approximately million for the remainder of 2024 , million in 2025 , million in 2026 , million in 2027 through 2031, and million thereafter. We have not included any amounts in the undelivered performance obligations amounts for those performance obligations that relate to a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less. For segment reporting purposes, the Company defines Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses excluding all stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges. The Company believes this measure is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses, by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP.

 respective fair market values. Braves Holdings, LLC ("Braves Holdings"), a consolidated subsidiary, was included in Corporate and Other prior to the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off (defined below). A tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or "track" the economic performance of a particular business or "group," rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. On July 18, 2023, the Company completed the split-off (the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off of its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. Atlanta Braves Holdings ). The Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off was accomplished by a redemption by the Company of each outstanding share of Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the corresponding series of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock. Atlanta Braves Holdings is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty Braves Group (the Braves Group immediately prior to the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off, except for the intergroup interests in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and Formula One Group, which were settled and extinguished in connection with the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off. On August 3, 2023, the Company reclassified its then-outstanding shares of common stock into three new tracking stocks Liberty SiriusXM common stock, Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock, and, in connection therewith, provided for the attribution of the businesses, assets and liabilities of the Company s remaining tracking stock groups among its newly created Liberty SiriusXM Group, Formula One Group and Liberty Live Group (the Reclassification ). As a result of the Reclassification, each then-outstanding share of Liberty SiriusXM common stock was reclassified into one share of the corresponding series of new Liberty SiriusXM common stock and 0.2500 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Live common stock and each outstanding share of Liberty Formula One common stock was reclassified into one share of the corresponding series of new Liberty Formula One common stock and 0.0428 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Live common stock. Each of the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and the Reclassification were intended to be tax-free to stockholders of the Company, except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. In July 2024, the IRS completed its review of the Reclassification and notified the Company that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. In September 2024, the IRS completed its review of the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and notified the Company that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. The Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and the Reclassification are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements on a prospective basis. On January 2, 2024, the Company purchased QuintEvents, LLC QuintEvents for total consideration of approximately 277 million, comprised of 205 million of cash, net of cash acquired of 66 million, and a 6 million settlement of a pre-existing condition. On September 9, 2024, Liberty completed the split-off (the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off of its wholly owned subsidiary, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Liberty Sirius XM Holdings ). The Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off was accomplished through the redemption by the Company of each outstanding share of Liberty SiriusXM common stock in exchange for 0.8375 of a share of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group immediately prior to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. The Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off was intended to be tax-free to holders of Liberty SiriusXM common stock (except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares). Following the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, on September 9, 2024, a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings merged with and into Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Sirius XM Holdings ), with Sirius XM Holdings surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings (the Merger and, together with the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, the Transactions ). As a result of the Transactions, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is an independent public company separate from Liberty. While the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own,

Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and other stock-based awards granted to officers, employees, nonemployee directors and employees of our subsidiaries. We recorded 27 million and 22 million of stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Liberty equity awards was approximately 15 million. Such amount will be recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 2.1 years. Acquisition costs. The Company recorded 3 million and 23 million of costs related to corporate acquisitions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Adjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP (as defined below) financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:

 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by tax related expense pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with Qurate Retail, Inc. recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Income taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of 135 million and 335 million, respectively, and income tax expense of 3 million and 41 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of 198 million and 78 million, respectively, and income tax expense of 46 million and 37 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized tax expense less than the expected federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to certain gains that are not taxable and earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates lower than the 21 U.S. federal tax rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized tax expense less than the expected federal tax rate of 21 due to tax benefits related to deductible stock-based compensation, certain gains that are not taxable and earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at rates lower than the 21 U.S. federal tax rate. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized tax expense greater than the expected federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to the impact of a reduction to deferred tax assets for certain federal tax credit carryforwards, partially offset by certain gains that are not taxable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized tax expense greater than the expected federal tax rate of 21 primarily due to certain losses that are not deductible for tax purposes. Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations. We had net earnings from continuing operations of 132 million and net earnings from continuing operations of 294 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net earnings from continuing operations of 152 million and 41 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The changes were the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses. Material Changes in Financial Condition As of September 30, 2024, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in U.S. Treasury securities, other government securities or government guaranteed funds, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments. The following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries (to the extent such cash exceeds the working capital needs of the subsidiaries and is not otherwise restricted), proceeds from net asset sales, monetization of our public investment portfolio (including derivatives), debt borrowings and equity issuances, and dividend and interest receipts.

In addition, the Company generated approximately 939 million of net proceeds from the issuance of approximately 12.2 million shares of Series C Liberty Formula One common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Formula 1 s primary use of cash was 50 million of capital expenditures, funded by cash from operations. The projected uses of Liberty's cash (excluding Formula 1 s uses of cash) are primarily capital expenditures, the investment in existing or new businesses, including the acquisition of Dorna Sports, S.L., debt service and the potential buyback of common stock under the approved share buyback program. Liberty expects to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, borrowing capacity under margin loans and outstanding or new debt instruments, or distributions from operating subsidiaries. Liberty may be required to make net payments of income tax liabilities to settle items under discussion with tax authorities. Formula 1 s uses of cash are expected to be capital expenditures, debt service payments and operating expenses. Liberty expects Formula 1 to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and cash provided by operations. We believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash. Results of Operations Businesses Formula 1. Formula 1 is a global motorsports business that holds exclusive commercial rights with respect to the World Championship, an annual, approximately nine-month long, motor race-based competition in which teams compete

Table of Contents 
 for the Constructors' Championship and drivers compete for the Drivers' Championship. The World Championship takes place on various circuits throughout the world. Formula 1 derives its primary revenue from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of race promotion, media rights and sponsorship arrangements. A significant majority of the race promotion, media rights and sponsorship contracts specify payments in advance and annual increases in the fees payable over the course of the contracts. The 2024 World Championship calendar is scheduled to have 24 Events. The 2023 World Championship calendar was originally scheduled to have 23 Events. However, following the cancellation of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola due to severe flooding in the region, and confirmation that it would not be replaced in May 2023, 22 Events took place, with income and cost recognition adjusted to reflect the revised 22 Event calendar during the second quarter of 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, seven Events took place, compared to eight Events in the corresponding period in the prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 18 Events took place, compared to 16 Events in the corresponding period in the prior year. Following the acquisition of QuintEvents, Formula 1 s results include intergroup revenue that is eliminated in consolidation. Formula 1 s operating results were as follows:

Primary Formula 1 revenue decreased 32 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, driven by the calendar variance, with one less Event held. Media rights revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the impact of the calendar variance on revenue recognition, partially offset by contractual increases in fees and continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue. Sponsorship revenue decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the impact of the calendar variance on revenue recognition and the different mix of Events held. Race promotion revenue increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the different mix of Events held and contractual increases in fees.

 Primary Formula 1 revenue increased 238 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, driven by the calendar variance, with two more Events held. Media rights revenue increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the impact of the calendar variance on revenue recognition, contractual increases in fees and continued growth in F1 TV subscription revenue. Sponsorship revenue increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by two additional Events in the period and fees from new sponsors. Race promotion revenue increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 driven by two more Events, contractual increases in fees and growing Sprint and F1 Academy fees. Other Formula 1 revenue is generated from miscellaneous and ancillary sources primarily related to the sale of tickets to the Formula One Paddock Club at most Events, facilitating the shipment of cars and equipment to and from Events outside of Europe, the sale of hospitality and experiences at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, the operation of the Formula 2, Formula 3 and the new F1 Academy series, other licensing opportunities, various television production activities and other ancillary operations. Other Formula 1 revenue increased 6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, driven by growth in licensing revenue and revenue generated from third-party events at the Grand Prix Plaza site in Las Vegas, partially offset by decreases in revenue from hospitality and experiences due to one less Event held. Other revenue increased 55 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, driven by the impact of two more Events, resulting in higher hospitality and freight income. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by the sale of new Formula 2 cars and associated parts at the beginning of the new Formula 2 vehicle cycle, higher licensing revenue and revenue generated from third-party events at the Grand Prix Plaza site in Las Vegas. Cost of Formula 1 revenue 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 amounts in millions Team payments (371) (432) (969) (888) Other costs of Formula 1 revenue (190) (183) (523) (452) Cost of Formula 1 revenue (561) (615) (1,492) (1,340) Cost of Formula 1 revenue decreased 54 million and increased 152 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Team payments are recognized on a pro-rata basis across the Events of the World Championship calendar. Team payments decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the pro rata recognition of expected team payments, with one less Event held in the current period. Team payments increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the pro rata recognition of expected increased team payments. Other costs of Formula 1 revenue are largely variable in nature and relate to both primary and other Formula 1 revenue. On an annual basis, the largest components of other costs of Formula 1 revenue are costs related to promoting, organizing and delivering the Las Vegas Grand Prix, hospitality costs, which are principally related to catering and other aspects of the production and delivery of hospitality offerings at the Las Vegas Grand Prix and the Paddock Club at other Events, and costs incurred in the provision and sale of freight, travel and logistical services. Other costs of Formula 1 revenue also include sponsorship and digital product sales commissions, circuit rights fees payable under various agreements with race promoters to acquire certain commercial rights at Events, including the right to sell advertising, hospitality and support race opportunities, annual Federation Internationale de l Automobile FIA regulatory fees, Formula 2 and Formula 3 cars, parts and maintenance services, costs related to the F1 Academy series, television production and post-production services, advertising production services and digital and social media activities. Other costs increased 7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to Las Vegas Grand Prix related lease costs, higher digital, F1 Academy and commissions and partner servicing costs associated with increased Primary Formula 1 revenue streams, partially offset by the impact of one less Event during the period, leading to lower FIA regulatory, technical, hospitality and travel costs. Other costs increased 71 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, primarily due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with increased Primary Formula 1 revenue streams, higher FIA

 regulatory, digital, technical, hospitality, freight and travel costs related to two more Events in the current year period, higher costs of the F1 Academy series and Las Vegas Grand Prix related lease costs. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was also driven by the costs of supplying the new Formula 2 cars and associated parts at the start of the new vehicle cycle. Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs, legal, professional and other advisory fees, bad debt expense, rental expense, information technology costs, insurance premiums, maintenance and utility costs and other general office administration costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22 million and 39 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher personnel, information technology, property, marketing, legal and other professional fee costs. Stock-based compensation was flat during the both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization decreased 8 million and 25 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices and interest rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investment activities, which include investments in fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate. As of September 30, 2024, our debt is comprised of the following amounts: 

Variable rate debt Fixed rate debt Principal Weighted avg Principal Weighted avg amount interest rate amount interest rate dollar amounts in millions Formula One Group 184 6.5 2,729 4.4 Liberty Live Group NA NA 1,200 2.3 The Company is exposed to changes in stock prices primarily as a result of our significant holdings in publicly traded securities. We continually monitor changes in stock markets, in general, and changes in the stock prices of our holdings, specifically. We believe that changes in stock prices can be expected to vary as a result of general market conditions, technological changes, specific industry changes and other factors. We periodically use equity collars and other financial instruments to manage market risk associated with certain investment positions. These instruments are recorded at fair value based on option pricing models and other appropriate methods. Additionally, our stock in Live Nation (one of our equity method affiliates), a publicly traded security, is not reflected at fair value in our balance sheet. This security is also subject to market risk that is not directly reflected in our condensed consolidated statement of operations, and had the market price of such security been 10 lower at September 30, 2024 the aggregate value of such security would have been 763 million lower.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its chief executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer (the "Executives"), of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of Part I. Refer to note 9 in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for changes in the legal proceedings described in the Form 10-K. Item 1A. Risk Factors Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), which Risk Factors are incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As a result of the completion of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, all of the risk factors under the headings Risks Relating to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and Risks Relating to the proposed Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off and Merger are no longer applicable as they relate to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In addition, certain of the risk factors under the headings Risks Relating to Our Company, as a Whole and Risks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock Due to Our Tracking Stock Capitalization are hereby replaced in their entirety as set forth below. Risks Relating to our Company, as a Whole The historical financial information of the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not necessarily reflect their results had they been separate companies. One of the reasons for the creation of a tracking stock is to permit equity investors to apply more specific criteria in valuing the shares of a particular group, such as comparisons of earnings multiples with those of other companies in the same business sector. In valuing shares of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock, investors should recognize that the historical financial information of the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group has been extracted from our consolidated financial statements and may not necessarily reflect what the Formula One Group s and the Liberty Live Group s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had each of these groups been separate, stand-alone entities pursuing independent strategies during the periods presented. We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding corporate-level indebtedness in the principal amount of 1.7 billion. At September 30, 2024, our only wholly owned consolidated subsidiary is Formula 1. Our ability to access the cash flow of Formula 1 is subject to covenant restrictions set forth in the debt instruments of certain subsidiaries of Delta Topco, the parent company of Formula 1. Accordingly, our ability to obtain significant financing in the future, on favorable terms or at all, may be limited. If debt financing is not available to us in the future, we may obtain liquidity through the sale or monetization of our debt or equity securities, or we may issue equity securities. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. If we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the future, we may be unable to develop our businesses properly, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and those attributed to our groups. A substantial portion of our consolidated debt is held above the operating subsidiary level, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service that debt and our other financial obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.7 billion principal amount of corporate-level debt outstanding, consisting of 475 million outstanding under our 2.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2027, 50 million outstanding under our 0.5 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050, 1.15 billion outstanding under our 2.375 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2053 and 54 million of other obligations. Our ability to meet our financial obligations will depend on our ability to access cash. Our primary sources of cash include our available cash balances, dividends and interest from our 

 II-1 

Table of Contents 
 investments, monetization of our public investment portfolio and proceeds from asset sales. Further, our ability to receive dividends or payments or advances from our businesses depends on their individual operating results, any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and the terms of their own indebtedness, including Formula 1 s subsidiary debt. The agreements governing such indebtedness restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, non-wholly owned subsidiaries or our partners. We generally do not receive cash, in the form of dividends, loans, advances or otherwise, from any of our subsidiaries or business affiliates. The success of businesses attributed to each of our tracking stock groups, in part, depends on their popularity with audiences, which is difficult to predict. Live entertainment events, including sporting events, are inherently risky businesses because the revenue derived from these businesses depends primarily upon their popularity with public audiences, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of live entertainment depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing programs, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which are difficult to predict. In the case of sponsorship agreements, audience size is an important factor when rates are negotiated. Audience size is an important factor when determining ticket pricing for live entertainment events and the value of broadcast rights. Consequently, low public acceptance of the services and events provided by companies such as Formula 1 and Live Nation could hurt the ability of these companies to maintain or grow revenue, which would adversely impact the financial performance of the groups to which these companies are attributed. Our businesses attributed to the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group, such as Formula 1 and Live Nation, may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic investments and initiatives. Our business strategy and that of our subsidiaries and business affiliates, including Formula 1 and Live Nation, may include selective acquisitions, other strategic investments and initiatives that allow them to expand their business. The success of any acquisition depends upon effective integration and management of acquired businesses and assets into the acquirer s operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the realization of the growth potential, any anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets. Weak and uncertain economic conditions may reduce consumer demand for products, services and events offered by our businesses attributed to each of our groups. A weak or uncertain economy in the U.S. or, in the case of the Formula One Group, abroad, could adversely affect demand for our products, services and events. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from discretionary spending by individuals, which typically falls during times of economic recession or instability. A reduction in discretionary spending could adversely affect revenue through reduced live-entertainment and sporting event expenditures. Accordingly, the ability of our businesses attributed to each of our groups to increase or maintain revenue and earnings could be adversely affected to the extent that relevant economic environments remain weak or decline further. In addition, inflation, which has significantly risen, may increase operational costs, including labor costs, and continued increases in interest rates in response to concerns about inflation may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. We currently are unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. Our Company has overlapping directors and management with Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and TripCo, which may lead to conflicting interests. As a result of transactions between 2011 and 2014 that resulted in the separate corporate existence of our Company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and TripCo, all or most of the executive officers of Liberty also serve as executive officers of Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and TripCo, and there are overlapping directors at each of Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and TripCo. Our executive officers and members of the Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and TripCo have fiduciary duties to that company s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our Company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband or TripCo pursues acquisitions and other business opportunities that 

 II-2 

Table of Contents 
 may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Moreover, most of our Company s directors and officers continue to own Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and/or TripCo stock and options to purchase stock in those companies. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and/or TripCo. Any potential conflict that qualifies as a related party transaction (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Each of Liberty Broadband and TripCo has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and its respective restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions deeming directors and officers not in breach of their fiduciary duties in certain cases for directing a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including our Company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband and TripCo) instead of such company. Other potential conflicts that arise will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband, TripCo and/or their respective subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our Company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Broadband, TripCo or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director. We may be subject to significant tax liabilities related to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. In connection with the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, we received an opinion of our tax counsel to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off will qualify as a generally tax-free transaction under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code to Liberty and to former holders of Liberty SiriusXM common stock. We did not obtain a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in such opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If it is determined that the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off does not qualify under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code, we and the former holders of Liberty SiriusXM common stock who received common stock of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings in the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off could incur significant tax liabilities. Even if the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off otherwise qualifies under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D), and related provisions of the Code, the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off would result in a significant U.S. federal income tax liability to us (but not to former holders of Liberty SiriusXM common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50 or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of our Company or in the stock of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings (or any successor corporation) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature, and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel described above, we or Liberty Sirius XM Holdings might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in our or Liberty Sirius XM Holdings ownership to occur, thereby triggering tax liability to us. Prior to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Sirius XM Holdings. Under this agreement, our Company is generally responsible for taxes and losses resulting from the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off; however, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is required to indemnify us for any taxes and losses (other than any taxes or tax-related losses that result from Section 355(e) of the Code applying to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off as a result of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off being part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire a 50-percent or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of our Company) resulting from the failure of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off to qualify as a generally tax-free transaction under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code, to the extent such taxes or losses (i) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by Liberty Sirius XM Holdings (applicable to actions or failures to act by Liberty Sirius XM Holdings and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off), (ii) result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the failure of certain representations made by Sirius XM Holdings in support of the opinion of our tax counsel regarding the 

 II-3 

Table of Contents 
 generally tax-free status of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off to be true and correct, or (iii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off as a result of the treatment of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off as part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50 or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings (or any successor corporation), except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), if such taxes and losses result from an action required to be taken pursuant to the transaction agreements relating to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. As the taxpaying entity, however, we are subject to the risk of non-payment by Liberty Sirius XM Holdings of its indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement. Cash for the payment of any taxes and losses resulting from the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off which are not allocated to and paid by Liberty Sirius XM Holdings pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with Liberty Sirius XM Holdings generally would be drawn from funds attributed to the Liberty Live Group, except that cash for the payment of any taxes and losses (a) resulting primarily from a breach by us following the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off of any contractual covenants made by us in connection with the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off or (b) resulting from Section 355(e) of the Code applying to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off as a result of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off being part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire a 50 or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the stock of our Company shall, in each case, be drawn proportionately from funds attributed to the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group based upon the relative market capitalizations of the tracking stock of each group over the first three trading days following completion of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, as determined in accordance with our tax sharing policies. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, we may determine to forgo certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to our Company, including certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. In addition, our potential tax liabilities related to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. Formula 1 and Live Nation have been, and may in the future be, materially impacted by a pandemic or epidemic, such as COVID-19. Although Formula 1 and Live Nation saw a return to normal business operations, schedules and events following the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear whether and to what extent a future pandemic or epidemic will impact the use of and/or demand for the entertainment, events and services provided by these businesses and demand for sponsorship and advertising assets. If these businesses face cancelled events, closed venues and reduced attendance, as was the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact may substantially decrease our revenue. For example, due to the revenue reductions caused by COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021, these businesses looked to reduce expenses, but should such impacts resume, the businesses may not be able to reduce expenses to the same degree as any decline in revenue, which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, our businesses are particularly sensitive to reductions in travel and discretionary consumer spending. We cannot predict the time period over which our businesses would be impacted by a future pandemic or epidemic. Over the long-term, a future pandemic or epidemic could impede economic activity in impacted regions or globally, causing a global recession, leading to a further decline in discretionary spending on sports and entertainment events and other leisure activities, which could result in long-term effects on our businesses. For the reasons set forth above and other reasons that may come to light as a result of a future pandemic or epidemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact to our future revenue, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, but such impacts have been, and may in the future be, significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

 Risks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock Due to Our Tracking Stock Capitalization The following risks relate to the ownership of our common stock due to our tracking stock capitalization. Holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock are common stockholders of our Company and, therefore, are subject to risks associated with an investment in our Company as a whole, even if a holder does not own shares of common stock of all of our groups. Even though we have attributed, for financial reporting purposes, all of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows among the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group in order to prepare the separate financial statement schedules for each of those groups, we will retain legal title to all of our assets and our tracking stock capitalization does not limit our legal responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any set of financial statement schedules. Holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to their associated group and, in any liquidation, holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and holders of Liberty Live common stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of our available net assets based on their respective numbers of liquidation units. Possible market confusion may result from holders of our tracking stocks mistakenly believing that they (i) directly own stock of a company that is attributed to one of our tracking stocks and (ii) have any equity or voting interests with respect to companies attributed to one of our tracking stocks. Our company holds interests in various companies, including public companies, and these interests are attributed to our tracking stock groups. In particular, following the Reclassification, the Formula One Group is comprised of our subsidiary that owns the Formula 1 business and the Liberty Live Group is primarily comprised of our interest in Live Nation. Depending on the composition of the assets underlying our tracking stock groups from time to time, confusion in the marketplace may occur if holders of our tracking stock mistakenly believe they own stock of a company attributed to the applicable tracking stock group. As described above, holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to their associated tracking stock group. Similarly, holders of these tracking stocks do not, by virtue of their ownership of our tracking stock, own any equity or voting interest in any company attributed to one of our tracking stock groups, including any public companies. The market price of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock may not reflect the performance of the businesses and assets attributed to the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group, respectively, as we intend. We cannot assure you that the market price of the common stock related to a group will, in fact, reflect the performance of the group of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to that group. Holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock are common stockholders of our Company as a whole and, as such, are subject to all risks associated with an investment in our Company and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of each tracking stock may, in part, reflect events that are intended to be reflected or tracked by a different tracking stock of our Company. In addition, investors may discount the value of the stock related to a group because it is part of a common enterprise rather than a stand-alone entity. The market price of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock may be volatile, could fluctuate substantially and could be affected by factors that do not affect traditional common stock. The market prices of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock and may be materially affected by, among other things: actual or anticipated fluctuations in a group s operating results or in the operating results of particular companies attributable to such group; potential acquisition activity by our Company (regardless of the group to which it is attributed) or the companies in which we invest; 

 II-5 

Table of Contents 
 issuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by our Company or the companies in which we invest and the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to each of the groups; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock or the companies attributable to our tracking stock groups; the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of our three tracking stocks, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment in our stocks; and general market conditions. 
 The market value of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the assets and businesses attributed to one or more of the other groups. Because we are the issuer of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock, an adverse market reaction to events relating to the assets and businesses attributed to one of our groups, such as earnings announcements, announcements of new products or services or acquisitions or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse market reaction in the common stock of the other groups. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole. Certain events may also have a greater impact on one group than the same triggering event would have on another group due to the asset composition of the affected group. In addition, the incurrence of significant indebtedness by us or any of our subsidiaries on behalf of one group, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with acquisitions of or investments in businesses, could affect our credit rating and that of our subsidiaries and, therefore, could increase the borrowing costs of businesses attributable to our other groups or the borrowing costs of our Company as a whole. We may not pay dividends equally or at all on Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock. We do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock for the foreseeable future. However, we have the right to pay dividends on the shares of common stock related to each group in equal or unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends on the shares of common stock related to one group and not pay dividends on shares of common stock related to another group. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to a group will reduce our assets legally available to be paid as dividends on the shares relating to another group. Our tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board of Directors may make decisions that could adversely affect only some holders of our common stock. Our tracking stock capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of stock related to one group might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of stock related to one or both of the other groups. In addition, given the nature of their businesses, there may be inherent conflicts of interests between the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group. Our tracking stock groups are not separate entities and thus holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock do not have the right to elect separate boards of directors. As a result, our Company s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to our Company as a whole and all of our stockholders as opposed to only holders of a particular group. Decisions deemed to be in the best interest of our Company and all of our stockholders may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. Examples include: decisions as to the terms of any business relationships that may be created between the tracking stock groups; the terms of any reattributions of assets between one or more groups; decisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock, or among the series of stocks relating to our groups, to be received in connection with a merger involving our Company; decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the groups, especially where the opportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of more than one group; 

 II-6 

Table of Contents 
 decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one or more groups but beneficial to another; decisions as to the conversion of shares of common stock of one group into shares of common stock of another; decisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any inter-group interest that one group may own in another group; decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to any of our groups; decisions as to the dispositions of assets of any of our groups; and decisions as to the payment of dividends on the stock relating to any of our groups. 
 Our directors or officers equity ownership may create or appear to create conflicts of interest. If directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the holders of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock. Other than pursuant to our management and allocation policies, we have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests among holders of shares of stock relating to our two groups, or among holders of different series of stock relating to a specific group. Rather than develop additional specific procedures in advance, the Board of Directors intends to exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best to: obtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests; determine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers; determine whether a committee of the Board of Directors should be appointed to address a specific matter and the appropriate members of that committee; and assess what is in our best interests and the best interests of all of our stockholders. 
 The Board of Directors believes the advantage of retaining flexibility in determining how to fulfill its responsibilities in any such circumstances as they may arise outweighs any perceived advantages of adopting additional specific procedures in advance. Our Board of Directors may change the management and allocation policies to the detriment of one or more groups without stockholder approval. The Board of Directors has adopted certain management and allocation policies to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding the relationship between the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, inter-group loans, inter-group interests, attribution of assets, financing alternatives, corporate opportunities and similar items. These policies also set forth the initial focuses and strategies of these groups and the initial attribution of our businesses, assets and liabilities among them. These policies are not included in the current Charter. The Board of Directors may at any time change or make exceptions to these policies. Because these policies relate to matters concerning the day-to-day management of our Company as opposed to significant corporate actions, such as a merger involving our Company or a sale of substantially all of our assets, no stockholder approval is required with respect to their adoption or amendment. A decision to change, or make exceptions to, these policies or adopt additional policies could disadvantage one or more groups while advantaging the other(s). 

 II-7 

Table of Contents 
 Stockholders will not vote on how to attribute consideration received in connection with a merger involving our Company among holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock. Our current Charter does not contain any provisions governing how consideration received in connection with a merger or consolidation involving our Company is to be attributed to holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and holders of Liberty Live common stock or to the holders of different series of stock, and none of the holders of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock will have a separate class vote in the event of such a merger or consolidation. Consistent with applicable principles of Delaware law, the Board of Directors will seek to divide the type and amount of consideration received in a merger or consolidation involving our Company among holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock in a fair manner. As the different ways the Board of Directors may divide the consideration between holders of stock relating to the different groups, and among holders of different series of a particular stock, might have materially different results, the consideration to be received by holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock in any such merger or consolidation may be materially less valuable than the consideration they would have received if they had a separate class vote on such merger or consolidation. We may dispose of assets of the Formula One Group or the Liberty Live Group without stockholder approval. Delaware law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of our Company taken as a whole, and our current Charter does not require a separate class vote in the case of a sale of a significant amount of assets of any of our groups. As long as the assets attributed to the Formula One Group or the Liberty Live Group proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of the assets of such group without any stockholder approval. If we dispose of all or substantially all of the assets attributed to any group (which means, for this purpose, assets representing 80 of the fair market value of the total assets of the disposing group, as determined by the Board of Directors), we would be required under the terms of our current Charter, if the disposition is not an exempt disposition under the terms of our current charter, to choose one or more of the following three alternatives: declare and pay a dividend on the disposing group s common stock; redeem shares of the disposing group s common stock in exchange for cash, securities or other property; and/or convert all or a portion of the disposing group s outstanding common stock into common stock of another group. 
 In this type of a transaction, holders of the disposing group s common stock may receive less value than the value that a third-party buyer might pay for all or substantially all of the assets of the disposing group. The Board of Directors will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value to holders of any stock related to a particular group. Holders of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to that group than if that group were a separate company. If the Formula One Group or the Liberty Live Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, stockholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than the holders of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the group to which their shares relate. In addition, we cannot assure you that in the event of such a sale the per share consideration to be paid to holders of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock, as the case may be, will be equal to or more than the per share value of that share of stock prior to or after the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the applicable group. Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of the shares of common stock related to that group. Accordingly, if we sell all or substantially all of the assets attributed to the Formula One Group or the Liberty Live Group, our stockholders could suffer a loss in the value of their investment in our stock.

Table of Contents 
 In the event of a liquidation of Liberty, holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock will not have a priority with respect to the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group remaining for distribution to stockholders. Under our current Charter, upon Liberty s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock will be entitled to receive, in respect of their shares of such stock, their proportionate interest in all of Liberty s assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common stock in proportion to their respective number of liquidation units per share, as previously determined in connection with the Reclassification. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of any of our tracking stocks upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Liberty will have nothing to do with the value of the assets attributed to the related tracking stock group or to changes in the relative value of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock over time. Holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock vote together and have limited separate voting rights. Holders of Series A and Series B Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock vote together as a single class, except in certain limited circumstances prescribed by our current Charter and under Delaware law. Each share of Series B common stock of each group has ten votes per share, and each share of Series A common stock of each group has one vote per share. Holders of Series C common stock of each group have no voting rights, other than those required under Delaware law. When holders of Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes are in a position to control the outcome of the vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our stockholders or has a greater impact on one group than another. Transactions in Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock by our insiders could depress the market price of those stocks. Sales of, or hedging transactions such as collars relating to, shares of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock by our Chairman of the Board of Directors, or any of our other directors or executive officers, could cause a perception in the marketplace that the stock price of the relevant shares has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our Company or the group to which the shares relates. This perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these transactions. As a result, insider transactions could depress the market price for shares of the Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock. Our capital structure, as well as the fact that the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group are not independent companies, may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for the businesses attributed to the Formula One Group or the Liberty Live Group and may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders. If the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group were separate independent companies, any person interested in acquiring the Formula One Group or the Liberty Live Group without negotiating with management could seek control of that group by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock, by means of a tender offer or a proxy contest. Although we intend Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock to reflect the separate economic performance of the Formula One Group and the Liberty Live Group, respectively, those groups are not separate entities and a person interested in acquiring only one group without negotiation with our management could obtain control of that group only by obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding voting shares of our Company. The existence of shares of common stock, and different series of shares, relating to different groups could present complexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have a capital structure similar to ours. Certain provisions of our current Charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include: authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B common stock related to each group that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A common stock related to each group that

 entitles the holder to one vote per share, and a Series C common stock related to each group that, except as otherwise required by Delaware law, entitles the holder to no voting rights; classifying the Board of Directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of the Board of Directors; limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders; prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 of our aggregate voting power or the approval by at least 75 of the Board of Directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our Company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our current Charter; and the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by the Board of Directors to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of our Company. 
 Liberty s Chairman, John C. Malone, beneficially owns shares (based on outstanding share information as of September 30, 2024) representing the power to direct approximately 49 of the aggregate voting power in Liberty, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 97 of the outstanding shares of each of the Series B Liberty Formula One common stock and the Series B Liberty Live common stock. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Share Repurchase Programs In November 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of 1 billion of the Company s common stock. In May 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1 billion of the Company s common stock. There were no repurchases of Liberty SiriusXM common stock, Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.1 billion was available for future share repurchase under our share repurchase program. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares of Liberty Formula One common stock or Liberty Live common stock, no shares of Series A Liberty SiriusXM common stock and 2,450 shares of Series C Liberty SiriusXM common stock were surrendered by our officers and employees to pay withholding taxes and other deductions in connection with the vesting of their restricted stock, restricted stock units and options.

EXHIBIT 3.1 
 LIBERTY MEDIA CORPORATION A Delaware Corporation AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS ARTICLE I STOCKHOLDERS Section 1.1 Annual Meeting . An annual meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing directors and of transacting any other business properly brought before the meeting pursuant to these Bylaws shall be held each year at such date, time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware or, if so determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, at no place (but rather by means of remote communication), as may be specified by the Board of Directors in the notice of meeting. Section 1.2 Special Meetings . Except as otherwise provided in the terms of any series of preferred stock or unless otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation, for the transaction of such business as may properly come before the meeting, may be called by the Secretary of the Corporation (the Secretary only (i) upon written request received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation by or on behalf of the holder or holders of record of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation, representing collectively not less than 66 2/3 of the total voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting or (ii) at the request of not less than 75 of the members of the Board of Directors then in office. Only such business may be transacted as is specified in the notice of the special meeting. The Board of Directors shall have the sole power to determine the time, date and place, either within or without the State of Delaware, or, if so determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, at no place (but rather by means of remote communication), for any special meeting of stockholders (including those properly called by the Secretary in accordance with Section 1.2(i) hereof). Following such determination, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting that a meeting will be held at the time, date and place, if any, and in accordance with the record date determined by the Board of Directors. Section 1.3 Record Date . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days nor less than ten (10) calendar days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders, such date shall be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of such meeting, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the record date for determining 

stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting in accordance with this Section 1.3. Section 1.4 Notice of Meetings . Notice of all stockholders meetings, stating the place, if any, date and hour thereof, as well as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting (if such record date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting); the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting; and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered by the Corporation in accordance with Section 5.4 of these Bylaws, applicable law and applicable stock exchange rules and regulations by the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, to each stockholder entitled to notice of such meeting, unless otherwise provided by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, at least ten (10) calendar days but not more than sixty (60) calendar days before the date of the meeting. Section 1.5 Notice of Stockholder Business . (a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders . (1) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, nominations for persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), or (iii) otherwise properly be requested to be brought before the meeting by a stockholder (x) who complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.5 and (y) who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such business is proposed or such nomination or nominations made, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the Corporation) both at the time the notice provided for in Section 1.5(a)(2) is delivered to the Secretary and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, and (z) who is entitled to vote at the meeting upon such election of directors or upon such business, as the case may be.

(2) In addition to any other requirements under applicable law and the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation, for a nomination for election to the Board of Directors or the proposal of business to be properly requested to be brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary and any such proposed business, other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors, must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, and applicable law. To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) calendar days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting; provided, that, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than twenty (20) calendar days, or delayed by more than seventy (70) calendar days, from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120 th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90 th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders or public announcement (as defined below) of the date of the meeting was made, whichever occurs first; and provided further, that for purposes of the application of Rule 14a-4(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act (or any successor provision), the date for notice specified in this paragraph (a)(2) shall be the earlier of the date calculated as hereinbefore provided or the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 14a-4. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a meeting of stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder notice as described herein. To be in proper written form, such stockholder s notice to the Secretary must be submitted by a holder of record of stock entitled to vote on the nomination of directors of the Corporation and shall set forth in writing and describe in fair, accurate, and material detail (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (a nominee (i) the name, age, business and residence address, and principal occupation or employment of the nominee, (ii) all information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act of 1934, and (iii) such nominee s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee, the accompanying proxy card and to serving as a director if elected (B) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), and (iii) any material interest of the stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, in such business and (C) as to such stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner or owners, if different, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, and any affiliates or associates (each within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) of such stockholder or beneficial owner (each a Proposing Person (i) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation s books, of such Proposing Person, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of the capital stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by such Proposing Person (provided that for purposes of this Section 1.5, such Proposing Person shall in all events be deemed to beneficially 
 3 

own any shares of any class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation as to which such Proposing Person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership at any time in the future), (iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements or understandings between (or on behalf of) such Proposing Person and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the proposals or nominations are to be made by such stockholder, (iv) a representation by each Proposing Person who is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation (A) that the notice the Proposing Person is giving to the Secretary is being given on behalf of (x) such holder of record and/or (y) if different than such holder of record, one or more beneficial owners of stock of the Corporation held of record by such holder of record, (B) as to each such beneficial owner, the number of shares held of record by such holder of record that are beneficially owned by such beneficial owner, with documentary evidence of such beneficial ownership, and (C) that such holder of record is entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination set forth in its notice, (v) a representation (I) whether any such Proposing Person or nominee has received any financial assistance, funding or other consideration from any other person in respect of the nomination (and the details thereof) (a Stockholder Associated Person and (II) whether and the extent to which any hedging, derivative or other transaction has been entered into with respect to the Corporation within the past twelve (12) months by, or is in effect with respect to, such Proposing Person, any person to be nominated by such Proposing Person or any Stockholder Associated Person, the effect or intent of which transaction is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder, nominee or any such Stockholder Associated Person, (vi) a representation whether any Proposing Person intends or is part of a group that intends to (I) deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Corporation s outstanding voting power required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (II) otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal, (vii) a representation that no Proposing Person or nominee is subject to, nor will enter into, any voting or other agreement that has not been disclosed to the Corporation and that could limit or interfere with such nominee s ability to comply, if elected, with their fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (viii) any other information relating to such Proposing Person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies in support of such proposal pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 1.5 shall not apply to any proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act. A proposal to be made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall be deemed satisfied if the stockholder making such proposal complies with the provisions of Rule 14a-8 and has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 and such stockholder s proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine (x) the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation and (y) whether the nominee would qualify as an independent director or audit committee financial expert under applicable law, securities exchange rule or regulation, or any publicly disclosed corporate governance guideline or committee charter of the Corporation. (3) In addition to the other requirements of this Section 1.5, each nominee who a Proposing Person proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director must deliver in writing (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under this Section 1.5) to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation a written 
 4 

questionnaire completed and signed by such nominee (in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request of any stockholder of record within ten (10) days of such request) with respect to the background, qualifications, and independence of such nominee and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made. (4) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1.5 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred (100) calendar days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting, a stockholder s notice required by this Section 1.5 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10 day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation. (5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, unless otherwise required by law, if any stockholder or Proposing Person (i) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act with respect to any proposed nominee and (ii) subsequently fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act (or fails to timely provide reasonable evidence sufficient to satisfy the Corporation that such stockholder has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act in accordance with the following sentence), then the nomination of each such proposed nominee shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that the nominee is included as a nominee in the Corporation s proxy statement, notice of meeting or other proxy materials for any annual meeting (or any supplement thereto) and notwithstanding that proxies or votes in respect of the election of such proposed nominees may have been received by the Corporation (which proxies and votes shall be disregarded). If any stockholder or Proposing Person provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act, such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation, no later than five business days prior to the date of the meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof, reasonable evidence that it has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act. (b) Special Meetings of Stockholders . Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation s notice of meeting. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation (and, with respect to any beneficial owner, if different, on whose behalf such nomination or nominations are made, only if such beneficial owner was the beneficial owner of shares of the Corporation) both at the time the notice provided for in paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1.5 is delivered to the Secretary and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation s notice of meeting, if the stockholder s notice meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1.5 (substituting special meeting for annual meeting as applicable) shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to 
 5 

be elected at such meeting provided, however, that a stockholder may nominate persons for election at a special meeting only to such directorship(s) as specified in the Corporation s notice of the meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder s notice as described above. (a) Updating and Supplementing of Stockholder Information . A stockholder providing notice of nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or notice of business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders shall further update and supplement such notice so that the information provided or required to be provided in such notice pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 1.5 shall be true and correct both as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting and as of the date that is ten (10) business days before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such updated and supplemental information shall be delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a) in the case of information that is required to be updated and supplemented to be true and correct as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, not later than the later of five (5) business days after such record date or five (5) business days after the public announcement of such record date, and (b) in the case of information that is required to be updated and supplemented to be true and correct as of ten (10) business days before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, not later than eight (8) business days before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof (or if not practicable to provide such updated and supplemental information not later than eight (8) business days before any adjournment or postponement, on the first practicable date before any such adjournment or postponement). (b) General . (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.5 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.5. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (i) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 1.5 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder s nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder s representation as required by clause (a)(2)(C)(vi) of this Section 1.5) and (ii) if any proposed nomination or proposed business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 1.5, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.5, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the nomination to the Board of Directors or to present the proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.5, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such 
 6 

stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders. (2) For purposes of this Section 1.5, (i) public announcement shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act, and (ii) business day shall mean any day, other than Saturday, Sunday and any day on which banks located in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by applicable law to close. (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.5, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 1.5. Nothing in this Section 1.5 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation. Section 1.6 Quorum . Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock and except as otherwise provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority in total voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall be present or represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a quorum is present at any meeting of the stockholders. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including, but not limited to, its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. In the absence of a quorum, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 1.7 hereof until a quorum shall be present. Section 1.7 Adjournment . Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time solely by the chairman of the meeting because of the absence of a quorum or for any other reason (including to address technical failures to convene or continue a meeting using remote communication) and to reconvene at the same or some other time, date and place, if any, or by means of remote communication. Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, thereof are (i) announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, (ii) displayed, during the time scheduled for the meeting, on the same electronic network used to enable stockholders and proxyholders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication, or (iii) set forth in the notice of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have full power and authority to adjourn a stockholder meeting in his sole discretion even over stockholder opposition to such adjournment. The stockholders present at a meeting shall not have the authority to adjourn the meeting. If the time, date and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote 
 7 

communication, if any, by which the stockholders and the proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, displayed, during the time scheduled for the meeting, on the same electronic network used to enable stockholders and proxyholders to participate in the meeting by means of remote communication, or set forth in the notice of the meeting, and the adjournment is for less than thirty (30) calendar days, no notice need be given of any such adjourned meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) calendar days or if after the adjournment a new record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting is fixed for the adjourned meeting, then notice shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the stockholders may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. Section 1.8 Organization . The Chairman of the Board, or in the Chairman of the Board s absence or at the Chairman of the Board s direction, the President, or in the President s absence or at the President s direction, any officer of the Corporation, shall call to order meetings of stockholders and preside over and act as chairman of such meetings. The Board of Directors or, if the Board fails to act, the stockholders, may appoint any stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation to act as chairman of any meeting in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the President and other officers. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the chairman of the meeting and announced at the meeting.

(b) For purposes of determining compliance at any time with Clause 27 (General Undertakings), in the event that any transaction meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of a Permitted Transaction, Permitted Acquisition, Permitted Loan, Permitted Guarantee, Permitted Financial Indebtedness, Permitted Joint Venture, Permitted Share Issue, Permitted Security, Permitted Disposal, Permitted Distribution, Permitted Payment, or Permitted Intercompany Debt Disposal, the Obligors Agent, in its sole discretion, may, from time to time, classify or reclassify such transaction or item (or portion thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of such transaction (or portion thereof) in any such classified or reclassified category. It is understood and agreed that any Permitted Transaction, Permitted Acquisition, Permitted Loan, Permitted Guarantee, Permitted Financial Indebtedness, Permitted Joint Venture, Permitted Share Issue, Permitted Security, Permitted Disposal, Permitted Distribution, Permitted Payment, or Permitted Intercompany Debt Disposal need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Transaction, Permitted Acquisition, Permitted Loan, Permitted Guarantee, Permitted Financial Indebtedness, Permitted Joint Venture, Permitted Share Issue, Permitted Security, Permitted Disposal, Permitted Distribution, Permitted Payment, or Permitted Intercompany Debt Disposal, respectively, but may instead be permitted in part under any combination thereof.

 65 

Permitted Intercompany Debt Disposal, respectively, shall not be counted against any other category of Permitted Transaction, Permitted Acquisition, Permitted Loan, Permitted Guarantee, Permitted Financial Indebtedness, Permitted Joint Venture, Permitted Share Issue, Permitted Security, Permitted Disposal, Permitted Distribution, Permitted Payment, or Permitted Intercompany Debt Disposal, respectively (i.e., each category shall be independent of each other category).

For the avoidance of doubt, any reference to outstanding under Clause 27 (General Undertakings) of this agreement (including any related definition and any related clauses, including, but not limited to, clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities) and clause 2.3 (Additional Debt)) shall not be implied to require the monitoring of any such amounts (i.e., no basket shall be maintenance based). If any Financial Indebtedness or Security or Quasi-Security securing Financial Indebtedness are incurred to refinance any existing Financial Indebtedness or Security or Quasi-Security securing Financial Indebtedness, in each case, initially incurred in reliance on a basket measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of incurrence, such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the Consolidated EBITDA at the time of incurrence of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Financial Indebtedness or such Financial Indebtedness secured by such Security or Quasi-Security, as applicable, does not exceed the principal amount (or accreted value or fair value, if applicable) of the relevant existing Financial Indebtedness or Financial Indebtedness secured by such Security or Quasi-Security, as applicable, being refinanced, plus Financial Indebtedness incurred to pay premiums, defeasance costs and fees and expenses in connection. (d) In connection with the incurrence of revolving loan Financial Indebtedness or any commitment or other transaction relating to the incurrence or issuance of Financial Indebtedness or the granting of any security to secure such Financial Indebtedness, the Obligors Agent may designate such incurrence and the granting of any security therefor as having occurred in full on the date of first incurrence of such revolving loan Financial Indebtedness or commitment or intention to consummate such transaction (such date, the Deemed Date ), and any related subsequent actual incurrence and granting of such security therefor will be deemed for all purposes under this agreement to have been incurred and granted on such Deemed Date; provided that, for purposes of calculating any ratio or usage of any baskets hereunder following the Deemed Date, only the outstanding portion of revolving loan 
 66 

Financial Indebtedness shall be considered for purposes of calculating any leverage ratio or usage of any baskets hereunder (e.g., unused commitments under such revolving Financial Indebtedness shall not be considered outstanding for purposes of this agreement or any Finance Document). (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all usages of fixed dollar baskets under this agreement (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBTIDA) prior to the 2024 Effective Date shall be disregarded as of the 2024 Effective Date and deemed permitted under this agreement and shall not be counted against any fixed dollar basket (including baskets measured as a percentage of Consolidated EBTIDA) that are set forth in this agreement on or after the 2024 Effective Date (i.e., all fixed dollar baskets are deemed refreshed on the 2024 Effective Date and any prior usages of such baskets are deemed to be zero). (f) With respect to determining availability under baskets set forth in this agreement that is determined by reference to a percentage of the most recently reported Consolidated EBITDA as of such time of determination (including on a greater of basis), the most recently reported Consolidated EBITDA shall be deemed to be the greater of (x) Consolidated EBITDA as of the applicable most recently ended Testing Period as of such time of determination and (y) the greatest Consolidated EBITDA for any trailing four fiscal quarter period ending prior to such Testing Period. 1.5 Cashless Roll. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement or in any other Finance Document, to the extent that any Lender extends the maturity date of, or replaces, renews or refinances, any of its then existing Loans with Incremental Term Facility Loans, Incremental RCF Commitments, Refinancing Term Loans, Replacement Revolving Loans, Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving Loans or loans incurred under a new credit facility, in each case, to the extent such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing is effected by means of a cashless roll by such Lender, such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with any requirement hereunder or any other Finance Document that such payment be made in Dollars , in immediately available funds , in cash or any other similar requirement. 1.6 Interest Rates; Benchmark Notifications .

Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, Clauses 15 (Interest Periods) and 16 (Changes to the Calculation of Interest) provide a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Facility Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Facility Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Group. The Facility Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this agreement, and shall have no liability to the Group, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, 
 67 

incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service. Notwithstanding the provisions of the definition of Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes herein, and Section 16.3 (Benchmark Replacement) hereunder, the Facility Agent shall be entitled to (but is not obliged to) request instructions from the Majority Lenders (or if this agreement or any other Finance Document stipulates the matter is a decision for any other Lender or group of Lenders, from that Lender or group of Lenders) as to whether, and in what manner, it should make or refrain from making a Benchmark Replacement Conforming Change and the Facility Agent may refrain from acting (but shall not be obliged to refrain from acting) unless and until it received any such instructions that it has requested. 2.

(k) Obligors Agent may implement the proposed Incremental Facility Commitments by delivering to the Facility Agent an Incremental Facility Commitment Letter signed by the Obligors Agent, the relevant Borrowers and the relevant Lenders and/or Further Lenders that have agreed to provide such Incremental Facility Commitments specifying: (i) the amount of Incremental Facility Commitments to be made available by each such Lender and/or Further Lender; (ii) whether such Incremental Facility Commitments are to increase the commitments under an existing Facility or to establish a new Facility; (iii) the date on which such Incremental Facility Commitments are to become committed; (iv) the identity and notice details of each such Lender and/or Further Lender; (v) the Availability Period applicable to such Incremental Facility Commitments; (vi) the identity of the Borrowers in respect of such Incremental Facility Commitments; (vii) the interest periods (if applicable) and interest rates (and any applicable margin ratchet) applicable to such Incremental Facility Commitments; (viii) the commitment fees payable in connection with such Incremental Facility Commitments; (ix) the final maturity date applicable to such Incremental Facility Commitments and any other repayment dates; (x) the currency or currencies in which such Incremental Facility Commitments may be drawn, provided that such currencies constitute Incremental Facility Currencies; 
 71 

(xi) the permitted purposes for which such Incremental Facility Commitments may be used; (xii) any such conditions precedent to availability or drawdown or provisions which allow the drawdown of such Incremental Facility Commitments to be on a certain funds basis as the Obligors Agent and such Lenders and/or Further Lenders may wish to specify; and (xiii) such other terms as Obligors Agent and such Lenders and/or Further Lenders may wish to specify which are applicable to such Incremental Facility. (l) Subject to any express restrictions set out in this clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities), the principal amount, interest rate, interest periods (if any) and interest payment dates, use of proceeds, repayment schedule, availability period and fees and all other terms applicable to the relevant Incremental Facility Commitments (including provisions for the relevant Incremental Facility Commitments to be made available on a certain funds basis) shall be agreed by the relevant Borrower (or the Obligors Agent on its behalf) and the lender(s) of those Incremental Facility Commitments without the need to obtain any further consent from any Finance Parties. Provided that an Incremental Facility Commitment Letter complies with the other provisions of this clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities) and no Event of Default is continuing at the date of the relevant Incremental Facility Commitment Letter or would occur as a result of implementing the Incremental Facility Commitments and subject to completing any know-your-customer or other similar checks contemplated by paragraph (r) below, the Facility Agent shall (and is irrevocably authorised by the Finance Parties to) promptly counter-sign that Incremental Facility Commitment Letter. Upon countersignature of an Incremental Facility Commitment Letter by the Facility Agent: (i) that Incremental Facility Commitment Letter shall constitute a Finance Document for the purposes of this agreement and the other Finance Documents; (ii) the commitments set out in such Incremental Facility Commitment Letter shall constitute Incremental Facility Commitments as from the date specified therein, without prejudice to any conditions precedent specified therein; (iii) the terms listed in paragraph (k) above and specified in that Incremental Facility Commitment Letter shall take effect and apply in respect of that Incremental Facility without prejudice to the other terms of this agreement which remain applicable to the other Facilities; and (iv) that Incremental Facility Commitment Letter and this agreement shall be read and construed together as a single agreement and references in the Finance Documents to this agreement shall include that Incremental Facility Commitment Letter. (m) The Facility Agent shall notify all the other Lenders of the terms of an Incremental Facility Commitment Letter promptly following receipt and shall notify the other Lenders as and when an Incremental Facility Commitment Letter has been countersigned by the Facility Agent. (n) Each Obligor and each Finance Party agrees and acknowledges that: (i) any Incremental Facility Commitments established pursuant to this clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities) and any Utilisations in relation thereto are intended to form part of the Indebtedness or Secured Obligations or Secured Liabilities (or equivalent definitions) in the Transaction Security Documents 
 72 

entered into or amended and confirmed on or around the Sixth Restatement Date or after (the Current Security Documents to which that Obligor is party; (ii) to the extent provided by applicable law, the security granted pursuant to the Current Security Documents then in effect is intended to secure, without limitation, all of the obligations of the Obligors under the Finance Documents, including in respect of any Incremental Facility Commitments established pursuant to this clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities). (o) Each Guarantor agrees and confirms that: (i) the guarantee and indemnity given by it contained in clause 23 (Guarantee and Indemnity) is intended to continue in full force and effect in respect of the obligations of the Obligors under the Finance Documents notwithstanding the establishment of any Incremental Facility Commitments pursuant to this clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities); and (ii) the guarantees and indemnities given by it contained in clause 23 (Guarantee and Indemnity) are intended to apply and extend to all of the obligations of the Obligors under the Finance Documents including in respect of any Incremental Facility Commitments. (p) The confirmations given by the Obligors in paragraphs (n) and (o) above are given subject to any limitations on such security or guarantees and indemnities as recorded in the relevant Finance Documents including the Current Security Documents, in clause 23.12 (Guarantee Limitations) or any Accession Letter by which the relevant Obligor became a Borrower and/or a Guarantor. (q) At the time any Incremental Facility Commitments are established which increase Commitments under an existing Facility, the Facility Agent is authorised (but not obliged) to record the Incremental Facility Commitments as a separate sub-facility of the applicable facility on the terms agreed between the Obligors Agent and the Facility Agent. The Facility Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such designation. Upon receiving an Incremental Facility Commitment Letter in respect of Incremental Facility Commitments which increase Commitments under an existing Facility, the Facility Agent may notify the relevant Borrowers and Lenders of any one-off interest periods and/or consolidation or division of Term Loans which is considered by it to be reasonably necessary for its administration of the Facility to which the Incremental Facility Commitments are to form part, whereupon such interest periods, consolidation or division shall take effect notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this agreement or the relevant Incremental Facility Commitment Letter. (r) The creation of Incremental Facility Commitments will only be effective in relation to a person that is not already a Lender upon the performance by the Facility Agent of all necessary know your customer or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations, the completion of which the Facility Agent shall promptly notify to the Parent, such person and the Issuing Bank (if applicable). The Facility Agent shall promptly undertake all such know your customer and other similar checks as soon as reasonably practicable. (s) The Finance Parties and each Obligor shall (at the cost of the Obligors) enter into any amendment to the Finance Documents and/or replacement or additional documentation consequential on or required by applicable law to effectively create any Incremental Facility Commitments (or to conform the terms of this agreement to those in force as a result of the operation of paragraph (l) above) and/or to ensure that (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) the Lenders in respect of the Incremental Facilities have (and the other Finance Parties continue to have) the 
 73 

benefit of the same guarantee and security interests under this agreement, any Accession Letter and the Transaction Security Documents as existed immediately before the establishment of any Incremental Facility Commitments pursuant to this clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities), including: (i) any changes to, the taking of, or the release coupled with the retaking of any Transaction Security; (ii) the entry into of any additional Transaction Security Documents; and/or (iii) the entry into of any supplemental agreements, confirmations or similar or equivalent documents. For the avoidance of doubt, no such action of an Obligor described in this paragraph (s) shall be a condition precedent to the establishment of the relevant Incremental Facility Commitments (unless requested by Obligors Agent or otherwise agreed between Obligors Agent and either the Majority Lenders or the lenders in respect of the relevant Incremental Facility Commitments) but may be a condition subsequent to be delivered within a time after such establishment reasonably specified by the Security Agent (with respect to any documents or actions required pursuant to this paragraph (s) relating to the Transaction Security), or the Facility Agent (with respect to any other documents or actions required pursuant to this paragraph (s), and agreed by Obligors Agent (acting reasonably). (t) The Facility Agent and the Security Agent are irrevocably authorised and instructed by each Finance Party to enter into any documentation referred to in the previous paragraph on behalf of any Finance Party and to take such other action as is reasonably required to give effect to the purposes set out in paragraph (s) above. (u) The Obligors Agent may elect to use the Incremental First Lien Ratio Builder prior to the Incremental Fixed Amount regardless of whether there is capacity under Incremental Fixed Amount, and if the Incremental Fixed Amount, on the one hand, and the Incremental First Lien Ratio Builder, on the other hand, are available and the Obligors Agent does not make an election, the Obligors Agent will be deemed to have elected to use the Incremental First Lien Ratio Builder to the extent compliant therewith. The Obligors Agent may elect to use capacity under Incremental Fixed Amount on the same date that the Borrower uses capacity under the Incremental First Lien Ratio Builder, by first calculating the capacity under the Incremental First Lien Ratio Builder without regard to the any use of capacity under the Incremental Fixed Amount; provided, further, that the Obligors Agent may redesignate all of any portion of any such Financial Indebtedness originally designated as incurred pursuant to the Incremental Fixed Amount as incurred pursuant to the Incremental First Lien Ratio Builder if, at the time of such redesignation, the Obligors Agent would be permitted to incur such Incremental Facility under the Incremental First Lien Ratio Builder (for purposes of clarity, with any such redesignation having the effect of increasing the ability to incur Financial Indebtedness under the Incremental Fixed Amount as of the date of such redesignation by the amount of such Financial Indebtedness so redesignated). 2.3 Additional Debt (a) Members of the Group may: (i) constitute commitments in respect of, incur or assume Financial Indebtedness which is secured on a pari passu basis with the Facilities Additional First Lien Debt );

The Obligors Agent may elect to use capacity under Incremental Fixed Amount on the same date that the Obligors Agent uses capacity under the Additional Debt Ratio Tests, by first calculating the capacity under the applicable Additional Debt Ratio Test without regard to the any use of capacity under the Incremental Fixed Amount; provided, further, that the Obligors Agent may redesignate all of any portion of any such Financial Indebtedness originally designated as incurred pursuant to the Incremental Fixed Amount as incurred pursuant to the applicable Additional Debt Ratio Tests if, at the time of such redesignation, the Obligors Agent would be permitted to incur such Incremental Facility under the applicable Additional Debt Ratio Tests (for purposes of clarity, with any such redesignation having the effect of increasing the ability to incur Financial Indebtedness under the Incremental Fixed Amount as of the date of such redesignation by the amount of such Financial Indebtedness so redesignated). (F) Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Additional Debt shall not be incurred, assumed or guaranteed by any Group Company that is not an Obligor and, to the extent secured, shall not be secured by any assets that do not secure the Commitments .

 78 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, no such action of an Obligor described above shall be a condition precedent to the incurrence or assumption of Additional Debt (unless agreed between Obligors Agent and the Majority Lenders) but may be a condition subsequent to be delivered within a time reasonably specified by the Security Agent after such establishment and agreed by Obligors Agent (acting reasonably). (f) The Facility Agent and the Security Agent are irrevocably authorised and instructed by each Finance Party to enter into any documentation referred to in the previous paragraph on behalf of any Finance Party and to take such other action as is reasonably required to give effect to the purposes set out in paragraph (d) above. 2.4 Finance Parties Rights and Obligations (a) The obligations of each Finance Party under the Finance Documents are several. Failure by a Finance Party to perform its obligations under the Finance Documents does not affect the obligations of any other Party under the Finance Documents. No Finance Party is responsible for the obligations of any other Finance Party under the Finance Documents. (b) The rights of each Finance Party under or in connection with the Finance Documents are separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Finance Documents to a Finance Party from an Obligor is a separate and independent debt in respect of which a Finance Party shall be entitled to enforce its rights in accordance with paragraph (c) below. The rights of each Finance Party include any debt owing to that Finance Party under the Finance Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, any part of a Loan or any other amount owed by an Obligor which relates to a Finance Party s participation in a Facility or its role under a Finance Document (including any such amount payable to the Agent on its behalf) is a debt owing to that Finance Party by that Obligor. (c) A Finance Party may, except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents, separately enforce its rights under or in connection with the Finance Documents. 2.5 Obligors Agent (a) Each Obligor (other than, if an Obligor, Obligors Agent) by its execution of this agreement or an Accession Letter (or other accession hereto) irrevocably appoints Obligors Agent to act on its behalf as its agent in relation to the Finance Documents and irrevocably authorises: (i) Obligors Agent on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself contemplated by this agreement to the Finance Parties and to give all notices and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests), to execute on its behalf any Accession Letter, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, supplements and variations (in each case, however fundamental) capable of being given, made or effected by any Obligor (notwithstanding that they may increase the Obligor s obligations or otherwise affect the Obligor) and to give confirmation as to continuation of surety obligations, without further reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and (ii) each Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to that Obligor pursuant to the Finance Documents to Obligors Agent, and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given the notices and instructions (including, without limitation, any Utilisation Requests) or executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication. 
 79 

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment, supplement, variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors Agent or given to the Obligors Agent under any Finance Document on behalf of another Obligor or in connection with any Finance Document (whether or not known to any other Obligor and whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became an Obligor under any Finance Document) shall be binding for all purposes on that Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly made, given or concurred with it. In the event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors Agent and any other Obligor, those of the Obligors Agent shall prevail. 2.6 Extension Offers (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, pursuant to one or more offers made from time to time by Obligors Agent to all Lenders of any participations in Term Loans with a like maturity date and/or Revolving Facility Commitments with a like maturity date on a pro rata basis, and on the same terms to each such Lender Pro Rata Extension Offers ), the Obligors Agent is hereby permitted to consummate transactions with individual Lenders that agree to such transactions from time to time to extend the maturity date of such Lender s participations in Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class and to otherwise modify the terms of such Lender s participations in Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class pursuant to the terms of the relevant Pro Rata Extension Offer (including, without limitation, increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Lender s participations in Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitments and/or modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such Lender s participations in Loans); provided that no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time a Pro Rata Extension Offer is delivered to the Lenders. For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to on the same terms in the preceding sentence shall mean, (i) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, that all of the participations in Term Loans of such Class are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to such extension are the same and (ii) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, that all of the Revolving Facility Commitments of such Facility are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to such extension are the same. Any such extension (an Extension agreed to between the Obligors Agent and any such Lender (an Extending Lender will be established under an Extension Amendment (any such extended participations in a Term Loan, a participation in an Extended Term Loan ; any such extended Revolving Facility Commitment, an Extended Revolving Commitment, and any Revolving Facility Loan made pursuant to such Extended Revolving Commitment, an Extended Revolving Loan ). Each Pro Rata Extension Offer shall specify the date on which the Obligors Agent proposes that the Extended Term Loan shall be made or the proposed Extended Revolving Commitment shall become effective, which shall be a date not earlier than five (5) Business Days after the date on which notice is delivered to the Facility Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Facility Agent in its reasonable discretion). (b) The Obligors Agent and each Extending Lender shall execute and deliver to the Facility Agent an amendment to this agreement (an Extension Amendment and such other documentation as the Facility Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments of such Extending Lender. Each Extension Amendment shall specify the terms of the applicable Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Commitments; provided, that (i) except as to interest rates, fees and any other pricing terms, and amortization, final maturity date and participation in prepayments and commitment reductions (which shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this proviso, be determined by the Obligors Agent and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), the Extended Term 
 80 

Loans shall have the same terms as the existing Class of Term Loans from which they are extended except for any terms which shall not apply until after the then latest Termination Date related to outstanding Term Loans, (ii) the final maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the maturity date of the Class of Term Loans subject to such Pro Rata Extension Offer, (iii) except as to interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms and final maturity (which shall be determined by the Obligors Agent and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), any Extended Revolving Commitment shall have the same terms as the existing Class of Revolving Facility Commitments from which they are extended except for any terms which shall not apply until after the Termination Date related to outstanding Revolving Facility Commitments and, in respect of any other terms that would affect the rights or duties of any Issuing Bank, such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank, and (iv) any Extended Term Loans may require participation on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) than the Term Loans in any mandatory prepayment hereunder. Upon the effectiveness of any Extension Amendment, this agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Commitments evidenced thereby and shall not require the consent of any Lender (other than an Extending Lender). Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the Facility Agent with the Obligors Agent s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto. If provided in any Extension Amendment with respect to any Extended Revolving Commitments, and with the consent of each Issuing Bank, participations in Letters of Credit shall be reallocated to lenders holding such Extended Revolving Commitments in the manner specified in such Extension Amendment, including upon effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Commitment or upon or prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving Facility Commitments. (c) Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable Extending Lender s participations in a Term Loan will be automatically designated a participation in an Extended Term Loan and/or such Extending Lender s Revolving Facility Commitment will be automatically designated an Extended Revolving Commitment. For purposes of this agreement and the other Finance Documents, (i) if such Extending Lender is extending a participation in a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have a participation in an Extended Term Loan and (ii) if such Extending Lender is extending a Revolving Facility Commitment, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an Extended Revolving Commitment. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement or any other Finance Document, (i) no Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, (ii) any Extending Lender may extend all or any portion of its participations in Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to one or more Pro Rata Extension Offers (subject to applicable proration in the case of over participation) (including the extension of any Extended Term Loan and/or Extended Revolving Commitment), (iii) there shall be no condition to any Extension of any participations in a Loan or Revolving Facility Commitment at any time or from time to time other than notice to the Facility Agent of such Extension and the terms of the Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Commitment implemented thereby, (iv) all Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall be obligations of the relevant Obligors under this agreement and the other Finance Documents that rank equally and ratably in right of security with all other obligations of the Class being extended (and all other obligations secured by the same priority of security securing the participations in Term Loans or Revolving Facility Loans being extended), (v) no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue Letters of Credit under such Extended Revolving Commitments unless it shall have consented thereto and (vi) there shall be no borrower (other than the Borrowers) and no guarantors (other 
 81 

than the Guarantors) in respect of any such Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Commitments. (e) Each Extension shall be consummated pursuant to procedures set forth in the associated Pro Rata Extension Offer; provided, that the Borrower shall cooperate with the Facility Agent prior to making any Pro Rata Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures with respect to mechanical provisions relating to such Extension, including, without limitation, timing, rounding and other adjustments. 3. PURPOSE 3.1 Purpose (a) Each Borrower shall apply amounts borrowed by it under each Revolving Facility and Term Facility, any Letter of Credit and any utilisation of any Ancillary Facility towards the general purposes (including, without limitation, for working capital purposes and any other purposes not prohibited by the Finance Documents) of the Group.

(b) Each Lender shall (according to its L/C Proportion) immediately on demand indemnify the Issuing Bank against any cost, loss or liability incurred by the Issuing Bank (otherwise than by reason of the Issuing Bank s gross negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment) in acting as the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (unless the Issuing Bank has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to a Finance Document). (c) If any Lender is not permitted (by its constitutional documents or any applicable law) to comply with paragraph (b) above, then that Lender will not be obliged to comply with paragraph (b) and shall instead be deemed to have taken, on the date the Letter of Credit is issued (or if later, on the date the Lender s participation in the Letter of Credit is transferred or assigned to the Lender in accordance with the terms of this agreement), an undivided interest and participation in the Letter of Credit in an amount equal to its L/C Proportion of that Letter of Credit. On receipt of demand from the Facility Agent, that Lender shall pay to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Issuing Bank) an amount equal to its L/C Proportion of the amount demanded. (d) The Borrower which requested (or on behalf of which Obligors Agent requested) a Letter of Credit shall immediately on demand reimburse any Lender for any payment it makes to the Issuing Bank under this clause 7.3 in respect of that Letter of Credit. (e) The obligations of each Borrower and each Lender under this clause are continuing obligations and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by that Lender in respect of any Letter of Credit, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part. (f) If a Borrower has provided cash cover in respect of a Lender s participation in a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall seek reimbursement from that cash cover before 
 89 

making a demand of that Lender under paragraph (b) above. Any recovery made by an Issuing Bank pursuant to that cash cover will reduce that Lender s liability under paragraph (b) above. (g) The obligations of any Lender or Borrower under this clause will not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this clause (including without limitation and whether or not known to it or any other person): (i) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person; (ii) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor or any Group Company; (iii) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security; (iv) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor, any beneficiary under a Letter of Credit or any other person; (v) any amendment (however fundamental) or replacement of a Finance Document, any Letter of Credit or any other document or security; (vi) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document, any Letter of Credit or any other document or security; or (vii) any insolvency or similar proceedings. 7.4 Cash Collateral by Non-Acceptable L/C Lender (a) If, at any time, a Lender under a Revolving Facility is a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender, the Issuing Bank may, by notice to that Lender, request that Lender to pay and that Lender shall pay, on or prior to the date falling five Business Days after the request by the Issuing Bank, an amount equal to that Lender s L/C Proportion of the outstanding amount of a Letter of Credit and in the currency of that Letter of Credit to an interest-bearing account held in the name of that Lender with the Issuing Bank. (b) The Non-Acceptable L/C Lender to whom a request has been made in accordance with paragraph (a) above shall enter into a security document or other form of collateral arrangement over the account, in form and substance satisfactory to the Issuing Bank, as collateral for any amounts due and payable under the Finance Documents by that Lender to the Issuing Bank in respect of that Letter of Credit. (c) Subject to paragraph (f) below, until no amount is or may be outstanding under that Letter of Credit, withdrawals from the account may only be made to pay to the Issuing Bank amounts due and payable to the Issuing Bank by the Non-Acceptable L/C Lender under the Finance Documents in respect of that Letter of Credit. (d) Each Lender under a Revolving Facility shall notify the Facility Agent and the Obligors Agent: 
 90

(e) Any notice received by the Facility Agent pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall constitute notice to the Issuing Bank of that Lender s status and the Facility Agent shall, upon receiving each such notice, promptly notify the Issuing Bank of that Lender s status as specified in that notice. (f) If a Lender who has provided cash collateral in accordance with this clause 7.4: (i) ceases to be a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender; and (ii) no amount is due and payable by that Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit, that Lender may, at any time it is not a Non-Acceptable L/C Lender, by notice to the Issuing Bank request that an amount equal to the amount of the cash provided by it as collateral in respect of that Letter of Credit (together with any accrued interest) standing to the credit of the relevant account held with the Issuing Bank be returned to it and the Issuing Bank shall pay that amount to the Lender within three Business Days after the request from the Lender (and shall cooperate with the Lender in order to procure that the relevant security or collateral arrangement is released and discharged). 7.5 Rights of Contribution No Obligor will be entitled to any right of contribution or indemnity from any Finance Party in respect of any payment it may make under this clause 7. 7.6 Conversion of Letter of Credit Liability (a) The relevant Issuing Bank shall as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of any claim notify Obligors Agent and the relevant Borrower for whose account the relevant Letter of Credit was issued specifying: (i) the latest date on which payment may be made in respect of the claim (the Payment Date ); and (ii) the amount of the claim (the Claimed Amount ). (b) The relevant Borrower may, but shall not be obliged to, without prejudice to paragraph (c) below and the Obligors obligations under this agreement, not later than 9.30 a.m. on the Business Day preceding the Payment Date, pay or procure the payment to the Issuing Bank of the Claimed Amount. (c) Upon payment of any Claimed Amount by the Issuing Bank, the Borrower for whose account the relevant Letter of Credit was issued shall be deemed to have issued a Utilisation Request in respect of a Revolving Facility Loan in the currency of and an amount equal to that Claimed Amount (which shall be a permitted amount for the purposes of clause 5.3 (Currency and Amount)) and the Utilisation Date for such 
 91 

Revolving Facility Loan shall be whichever is the later of the Specified Time referred to in clause 5.1 (Delivery of a Utilisation Request) for that Revolving Facility Loan and the relevant Payment Date and the Interest Period for such Revolving Facility Loan (if a Term Benchmark Loan) shall be one month. 8. OPTIONAL CURRENCIES 8.1 Selection of Currency A Borrower (or Obligors Agent on behalf of a Borrower) shall select the currency of a Utilisation of a Revolving Facility in a Utilisation Request. 8.2 Unavailability of a Currency If before the Specified Time on any Quotation Day: (a) a Lender notifies the Facility Agent that the Optional Currency requested is not readily available to it in the amount required; or (b) a Lender notifies the Facility Agent that compliance with its obligation to participate in a Loan in the proposed Optional Currency would contravene a law or regulation applicable to it, the Facility Agent will give notice to the relevant Borrower or Obligors Agent to that effect by the Specified Time on that day. In this event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this clause 8.2 will be required to participate in the Loan in the Base Currency (in an amount equal to that Lender s proportion of the Base Currency Amount, or in respect of a Rollover Loan, an amount equal to that Lender s proportion of the Base Currency Amount of the Rollover Loan that is due to be made) and its participation will be treated as a separate Loan denominated in the Base Currency during that Interest Period (if applicable). 8.3 Facility Agent s Calculations (a) All calculations made by the Facility Agent pursuant to this clause 8 will take into account any repayment, prepayment, consolidation or division of Term Loans to be made on the first Interest Payment Date.

 92 

9.2 Availability (a) If Obligors Agent and a Lender agree and except as otherwise provided in this agreement, the Lender may provide an Ancillary Facility on a bilateral basis in place of all or part of that Lender s unutilised Revolving Facility Commitment. (b) An Ancillary Facility (other than the Existing Ancillary Facility which has been automatically deemed made available as an Ancillary Facility to Facility RCF pursuant to the 2022 Amendment Agreement) shall not be made available unless, not later than 5 Business Days prior to the Ancillary Commencement Date for an Ancillary Facility, the Facility Agent has received from Obligors Agent: (i) a notice in writing requesting the establishment of an Ancillary Facility and specifying: (A) the Revolving Facility from which the Ancillary Facility will be established; (B) the proposed Borrowers (or Affiliates of a Borrower) which may use the Ancillary Facility; (C) the proposed Ancillary Commencement Date and expiry date of the Ancillary Facility; (D) the proposed type of Ancillary Facility to be provided; (E) the proposed Ancillary Lender; (F) the proposed Ancillary Commitment, the maximum amount of the Ancillary Facility (if not denominated in the Base Currency) and, if the Ancillary Facility is an overdraft facility comprising more than one account its maximum gross amount (that amount being the Designated Gross Amount and its maximum net amount (that amount being the Designated Net Amount ); and (G) the proposed currency of the Ancillary Facility (if not denominated in the Base Currency); (ii) a copy of the proposed Ancillary Document; and (iii) any other information which the Facility Agent may reasonably request in connection with the Ancillary Facility. The Facility Agent shall promptly notify Obligors Agent, the Ancillary Lender and the other Lenders of the establishment of an Ancillary Facility. No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this clause). In such a case, the provisions of this agreement with regard to amendments and waivers will apply. (c) Subject to compliance with paragraph (b) above: (i) the Lender concerned will become an Ancillary Lender; and (ii) the Ancillary Facility will be available, 
 93 

with effect from the date agreed by Obligors Agent and the Ancillary Lender. 9.3 Terms of Ancillary Facilities (a) Except as provided below, the terms of any Ancillary Facility will be those agreed by the Ancillary Lender and Obligors Agent. (b) However, those terms: (i) must be based upon normal commercial terms at that time (except as varied by this agreement); (ii) may allow only Borrowers (or Affiliates of Borrowers nominated pursuant to clause 9.9 (Affiliates of Borrowers)) to use the Ancillary Facility; (iii) may not allow the Ancillary Outstandings to exceed the Ancillary Commitment; (iv) may not, otherwise than as a result solely of currency fluctuations, allow the Ancillary Commitment of a Lender to exceed the Available Commitment of that Lender under the relevant Revolving Facility (before taking into account the effect of the Ancillary Facility on that Available Commitment); and (v) must require that the Ancillary Commitment is reduced to nil, and that all Ancillary Outstandings are repaid (or cash cover provided in respect of all the Ancillary Outstandings) not later than the Termination Date for the relevant Revolving Facility (or such earlier date as the applicable Revolving Facility Commitment of the relevant Ancillary Lender (or its Affiliate) is reduced to zero). (c) If there is any inconsistency between any term of an Ancillary Facility and any term of this agreement, this agreement shall prevail except for: (i) clause 37.3 (Day Count Convention) which shall not prevail for the purposes of calculating fees, interest or commission relating to an Ancillary Facility; and (ii) an Ancillary Facility comprising more than one account where the terms of the Ancillary Documents shall prevail. (d) Interest, commission and fees on Ancillary Facilities are dealt with in clause 17.5 (Interest, Commission and Fees on Ancillary Facilities). 9.4 Repayment of Ancillary Facility (a) An Ancillary Facility shall cease to be available on the Termination Date in relation to the applicable Revolving Facility or such earlier date on which its expiry date occurs or on which it is cancelled in accordance with the terms of this agreement. (b) If an Ancillary Facility expires in accordance with its terms the Ancillary Commitment of the Ancillary Lender shall be reduced to zero. (c) No Ancillary Lender may demand repayment or prepayment of any amounts or demand cash cover for any liabilities made available or incurred by it under its Ancillary Facility (except where the Ancillary Facility is provided on a net limit basis to the extent required to bring any gross outstandings down to the net limit) unless: (i) the Total Revolving Facility Commitments under the relevant Revolving Facility have been cancelled in full, or all outstanding Utilisations under that Revolving Facility have become due and payable in accordance with the terms 
 94 

of this agreement, or the Facility Agent has declared all outstanding Utilisations under that Revolving Facility immediately due and payable, or the expiry date of the Ancillary Facility occurs; or (ii) it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for the Ancillary Lender (or its Affiliate, if relevant) to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by this agreement or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in its Ancillary Facility; or (iii) the Ancillary Outstandings (if any) under that Ancillary Facility can be refinanced by a Revolving Facility Utilisation under the same Revolving Facility and the Ancillary Lender gives sufficient notice to enable a Utilisation of that Revolving Facility to be made to refinance those Ancillary Outstandings. (d) For the purposes of determining whether or not the Ancillary Outstandings under an Ancillary Facility mentioned in paragraph (c)(iii) above can be refinanced by a Utilisation of a Revolving Facility: (i) the Revolving Facility Commitment of the Ancillary Lender under that Revolving Facility will be increased by the amount of its Ancillary Commitment; and (ii) the Utilisation may (so long as paragraph (c)(i) above does not apply) be made irrespective of whether a Default is outstanding or any other applicable condition precedent is not satisfied (but only to the extent that the proceeds are applied in refinancing those Ancillary Outstandings) and irrespective of whether clause 4.4 (Maximum Number of Utilisations) or clause 5.2(a)(iii) (Completion of a Utilisation Request for Loans) applies. (e) On the making of a Utilisation of a Revolving Facility to refinance Ancillary Outstandings: (i) each Lender will participate in that Utilisation in an amount (as determined by the Facility Agent) which will result as nearly as possible in the aggregate amount of its participation in Utilisations then outstanding bearing the same proportion to the aggregate amount of the Utilisations then outstanding as its Revolving Facility Commitment bears to the aggregate of the Revolving Facility Commitments, in each case, under that Revolving Facility; and (ii) the relevant Ancillary Facility shall be cancelled. (f) In relation to an Ancillary Facility which comprises an overdraft facility where a Designated Net Amount has been established, the Ancillary Lender providing that Ancillary Facility shall only be obliged to take into account for the purposes of calculating compliance with the Designated Net Amount those credit balances which it is permitted to take into account by the then current law and regulations in relation to its reporting of exposures to applicable regulatory authorities as netted for capital adequacy purposes. (g) In relation to an Ancillary Facility which comprises either a single account or multiple account overdraft facility, any credit balances held by the relevant Ancillary Lender in relation to that Ancillary Facility will not be repayable to the extent that repayment would cause any Designated Net Amount to be exceeded. 9.5 Ancillary Outstandings Each Borrower and each Ancillary Lender agrees with and for the benefit of each Lender that: 
 95 

(a) the Ancillary Outstandings under any Ancillary Facility provided by that Ancillary Lender shall not exceed the Ancillary Commitment applicable to that Ancillary Facility and where the Ancillary Facility is an overdraft facility comprising more than one account, Ancillary Outstandings under that Ancillary Facility shall not exceed the Designated Net Amount in respect of that Ancillary Facility; and (b) where all or part of the Ancillary Facility is an overdraft facility comprising more than one account, the Ancillary Outstandings (calculated on the basis that the words in brackets in paragraph (a) of the definition of that term were deleted) shall not exceed the Designated Gross Amount applicable to that Ancillary Facility. 9.6 Adjustment for Ancillary Facilities upon Acceleration In this clause 9.6: Revolving Outstandings means, in relation to a Lender and a Revolving Facility, the aggregate of the equivalent in the Base Currency of: (a) its participation in each Utilisation under that Revolving Facility then outstanding (together with the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it as a Lender under that Revolving Facility); and (b) if the Lender is also an Ancillary Lender, the Ancillary Outstandings in respect of Ancillary Facilities provided by that Ancillary Lender under that Revolving Facility (together with the aggregate amount of all accrued interest, fees and commission owed to it as an Ancillary Lender in respect of the Ancillary Facility); and Total Revolving Outstandings means the aggregate of all Revolving Outstandings under a Revolving Facility. (a) If a notice is served under clause 28.22 (Acceleration) (other than a notice declaring Utilisations to be due on demand), each Lender and each Ancillary Lender shall promptly adjust by corresponding transfers (to the extent necessary) their claims in respect of amounts outstanding to them under any Revolving Facility and each Ancillary Facility granted thereunder to ensure that after such transfers the Revolving Outstandings of each Lender bear the same proportion to the Total Revolving Outstandings as such Lender s Revolving Facility Commitment bears to the Total Revolving Facility Commitments, each as at the date the notice is served under clause 28.22 (Acceleration). (b) If an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility is a contingent liability and that contingent liability becomes an actual liability or is reduced to zero after the original adjustment is made under paragraph (a) above, then each Lender and Ancillary Lender will make a further adjustment by corresponding transfers (to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the position they would have been in had the original adjustment been determined by reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the contingent liability. (c) Any transfer of rights and obligations relating to Revolving Outstandings made pursuant to this Clause 9.6 shall be made for a purchase price in cash, payable at the time of transfer, in an amount equal to those Revolving Outstandings. (d) Prior to the application of the provisions of paragraph (a) above, an Ancillary Lender that has provided an overdraft comprising more than one account under an Ancillary Facility shall set off any liabilities owing to it under such overdraft facility against credit balances on any account comprised in such overdraft facility. (e) All calculations to be made pursuant to this clause 9.6 shall be made by the Facility Agent based on upon information provided to it by the Lenders and Ancillary Lenders. 
 96 

9.7 Information Each Borrower and each Ancillary Lender shall, promptly upon request by the Facility Agent, supply the Facility Agent with any information relating to the operation of an Ancillary Facility (including the Ancillary Outstandings) as the Facility Agent may reasonably request from time to time. Each Borrower consents to all such information being released to the Facility Agent and the other Finance Parties. 9.8 Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders (a) Subject to the terms of this agreement, an Affiliate of a Lender may become an Ancillary Lender. In such case, the Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single Lender having a Revolving Facility Commitment of the relevant Lender. For the purposes of calculating the Lender s Available Commitment with respect to a Revolving Facility, the Lender s Commitment shall be reduced to the extent of the aggregate of the Ancillary Commitments of its Affiliates in relation to that Revolving Facility. (b) Obligors Agent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any notice delivered by Obligors Agent to the Facility Agent pursuant to clause 9.2(b)(i) (Availability). (c) An Affiliate of a Lender which becomes an Ancillary Lender shall accede to this agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement by delivery to the Security Agent of a duly completed accession undertaking in the form scheduled to each Intercreditor Agreement. (d) If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and obligations to a New Lender (as defined in clause 29 (Changes to the Lenders)), its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under this agreement or any Ancillary Document. (e) Where this agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on an Ancillary Lender and the relevant Ancillary Lender is an Affiliate of a Lender which is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate. 9.9 Affiliates of Borrowers (a) Subject to the terms of this agreement, an Affiliate of a Borrower (other than any Affiliate incorporated in Belgium or Switzerland) may with the approval of the relevant Lender become a borrower with respect to an Ancillary Facility. (b) Obligors Agent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Borrower in any notice delivered by Obligors Agent to the Facility Agent pursuant to clause 9.2(b)(i) (Availability). (c) If a Borrower ceases to be a Borrower under this agreement in accordance with clause 30.3 (Resignation of a Borrower), its Affiliate shall cease to have any rights under this agreement or any Ancillary Document. (d) Where this agreement or any other Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate. (e) Any reference in this agreement or any other Finance Document to a Borrower being under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a 
 97 

Borrower being under no obligations under any Finance Document or Ancillary Document. 9.10 Revolving Facility Commitment Amounts Notwithstanding any other term of this agreement, in relation to each Revolving Facility, each Lender shall ensure that at all times its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than: (a) its Ancillary Commitment; or (b) the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate. 10. REPAYMENT 10.1 Repayment of Term Loans (a) The Borrower under the Term Facility A shall repay the Term Facility A Loans outstanding under the Term Facility A on the dates set forth below an amount equal to the product of the aggregate initial principal amount of Term Facility A Loans which have been made prior to such date multiplied by the amortization percentage set forth opposite such date (subject to adjustment for any prepayment made pursuant to the terms of this agreement and provided that any Term Facility A Loan made after any such date shall only be taken into account for repayment instalments after the date on which such Term Facility A loan was made):

(b) Without prejudice to each Borrower s obligation under paragraph (a) above, if: (i) one or more Revolving Facility Loans are to be made available to a Borrower: (A) on the same day that a maturing Revolving Facility Loan is due to be repaid by that Borrower; (B) in the same currency as the maturing Revolving Facility Loan; and (C) in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing Revolving Facility Loan; and (ii) the proportion borne by each Lender s participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan to the amount of that maturing Revolving Facility Loan is the same as the proportion borne by that Lender s participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans to the aggregate amount of those new Revolving Facility Loans, the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans shall, unless the relevant Borrower notifies the Facility Agent to the contrary in the relevant Utilisation Request, be treated as if applied in or towards repayment of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan so that: (A) if the amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan exceeds the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans: (1) the relevant Borrower will only be required to make a payment under Clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in an amount in the relevant currency equal to that excess; and (2) each Lender s participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender s participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loans and that Lender will not be required to make a payment under Clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in respect of its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans; and (B) if the amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan is equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans: (1) the relevant Borrower will not be required to make a payment under Clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent); and (2) each Lender will be required to make a payment under Clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in respect of its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans only to the extent that its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans exceeds that Lender s participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan and the remainder of that Lender s participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender s participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan. 11. ILLEGALITY, VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION 11.1 Illegality If it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a Lender (or its Affiliate which is an Ancillary Lender or Designated Entity, if relevant) to perform any of its obligations as

 (c) The Borrower shall notify the Facility Agent in writing of any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to Clause 12.2(b) (Disposal and Insurance Proceeds and Excess Cash Flow). The Facility Agent will promptly notify each Lender with a participation in any Term Loans of the contents of any such prepayment notice and of such Lender s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender s pro rata share of each relevant Class of the Term Loans) at least 4 Business Days prior to the Prepayment Date. Lender may decline to accept all (but not less than all) of its share of any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Clause 12.2(b) (Disposal and Insurance Proceeds and Excess Cash Flow) (any such Lender, a Declining Lender by providing written notice to the Facility Agent no later than two Business Days after the date of such Lender s receipt of notice from the Facility Agent regarding such prepayment. If any Lender does not give a notice to the Facility Agent on or prior to such two Business Day time period informing the Facility Agent that it declines to accept the applicable prepayment, then such Lender will be deemed 
 104 

to have accepted such prepayment. On any Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Prepayment Amount minus the portion thereof allocable to Declining Lenders, in each case for such Prepayment Date, shall be paid to the Facility Agent by the Borrower and applied by the Facility Agent ratably to prepay Loans owing to Lenders (other than Declining Lenders) in the manner described in Clause 12.3 (Applicable of Mandatory Prepayments) for such prepayment. Any amounts that would otherwise have been applied to prepay Loans owing to Declining Lenders shall be retained by the Borrower (such amounts retained by the Borrower, Declined Amounts for any purposes not prohibited by this agreement. 12.3 Application of Mandatory Prepayments (a) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, a prepayment made under clause 12.2(b) (Disposal and Insurance Proceeds and Excess Cashflow) shall be applied pro rata against each Term Loan, provided that prepayments made under paragraph (iii) of clause 12.2(b) shall be applied against Term Facility B Loans and if applicable any Incremetal Term Facility Loans that the Obligors Agent has designated as Incremental Term Facility B Loans . In addition, such prepayments shall be applied to the remaining instalments of the Term Loans under the applicable Class or Classes as the relevant Borrower or the Obligors Agent shall select (and if no selection is made then such prepayment shall be applied on remaining instalments in direct order). (b) Unless Obligors Agent makes an election under paragraph (c) below, the Borrowers shall prepay Term Loans at the following times (each such date, a Prepayment Date ): (i) in the case of any prepayment relating to the amounts of Disposal Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds within 10 Business Days (or such longer period as may be reasonable acceptable to the Facility Agent) or, if Obligors Agent elects to reinvest such amounts as permitted by clause 12.2 above, upon expiry of the applicable period for reinvestment and/or commitment to reinvest specified in clause 12.2 above; and (ii) in the case of any prepayment relating to an amount of Excess Cashflow, on the last day of the first Interest Period (or with respect to a RFR Loan, the next Interest Payment Date) ending at least 10 Business Days after delivery pursuant to clause 25.1 (Financial Statements) of the Annual Financial Statements of the Parent. (c) Subject to paragraph (d) below, Obligors Agent may elect that any prepayment under clause 12.2 (Disposal and Insurance Proceeds and Excess Cashflow) be applied in prepayment of a Term Loan that is a Term Benchmark Loan on the last day of the Interest Period (or with respect to a RFR Loan, the next Interest Payment Date) relating to that Term Loan. If Obligors Agent makes that election, then a proportion of the Term Loan equal to the amount of the relevant prepayment will be due and payable on the last day of its Interest Period (or with respect to a RFR Loan, the next Interest Payment Date). For the avoidance of doubt, Term Facility Loans and Incremental Term Facility Loans shall be considered separate Term Loans for these purposes. (d) If Obligors Agent has made an election under paragraph (c) above but a Default has occurred and is continuing, that election shall no longer apply and a proportion of the Term Loan in respect of which the election was made equal to the amount of the relevant prepayment shall be immediately due and payable (unless the Majority Lenders otherwise agree in writing). 12.4 Excluded Proceeds 
 105 

Where Excluded Disposal Proceeds and Excluded Insurance Proceeds include amounts which are intended to be used for a specific purpose within a specified period (as set out in the relevant definition of Excluded Disposal Proceeds or Excluded Insurance Proceeds), Obligors Agent shall ensure that those amounts are used for that purpose and, if requested to do so by the Facility Agent, shall promptly deliver a certificate to the Facility Agent at the time of such application and at the end of such period confirming the amount (if any) which has been so applied within the requisite time periods provided for in the relevant definition. 12.5 Upstreaming Monies If: (a) monies are required to be applied in prepayment or repayment of the Facilities under this clause 12 (Mandatory Prepayments) but in order to be so applied need to be upstreamed or otherwise transferred from one Group Company to another Group Company to effect that prepayment or repayment; and (b) such monies cannot be so upstreamed or transferred or the relevant prepayment may not be made without breaching a financial assistance prohibition or without breaching some other legal restriction or without the Group incurring a material cost (whether as a result of paying additional Taxes or otherwise), there will be no obligation to make that payment or prepayment until that impediment no longer applies. Each Obligor will (and Obligors Agent will procure that each other Group Company will) use all reasonable endeavours to overcome that impediment. 12.6 Election Subject to clause 12.3(a) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments) above, any prepayment of Loans required by this agreement shall (if there are two or more Borrowers of such Loans) be made by such Borrower or Borrowers and (if applicable) in such proportions as Obligors Agent may specify. 13. RESTRICTIONS 13.1 Notices of Cancellation or Prepayment Any notice of cancellation or prepayment, authorisation or other election given by any Party under clause 11 (Illegality, Voluntary Prepayment and Cancellation) or clause 12.3(c) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments) shall (subject to the terms of those clauses) be irrevocable and shall specify the date or dates upon which the relevant cancellation or prepayment is to be made and the amount of that cancellation or prepayment. 13.2 Interest and Other Amounts Any prepayment under this agreement shall be made together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid and without premium or penalty other than Break Costs. 13.3 No Reborrowing of Term Facilities Without prejudice to clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities), no Borrower may reborrow any part of a Term Facility which is prepaid. 13.4 Reborrowing of Revolving Facility Unless a contrary indication appears in this agreement, any part of a Revolving Facility which is prepaid may be reborrowed in accordance with the terms of this agreement. 13.5 Prepayment in accordance with Agreement 
 106 

No Borrower shall repay or prepay all or any part of the Utilisations or cancel all or any part of the Commitments except at the times and in the manner expressly provided for in this agreement. 13.6 No Reinstatement of Commitments Without prejudice to clause 2.2 (Incremental Facilities), no amount of the Total Commitments cancelled under this agreement may be subsequently reinstated. 13.7 Facility Agent s Receipt of Notices If the Facility Agent receives a notice under clause 11 (Illegality, Voluntary Prepayment and Cancellation) or an election under clause 12.3(d) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments) it shall promptly forward a copy of that notice or election to either Obligors Agent or the affected Lender, as appropriate. 13.8 Effect of repayment and prepayment on Commitments If all or part of any Lender s participation in a Utilisation under a Facility is repaid or prepaid and is not available for redrawing (other than by operation of Clause 4.2 (Further conditions precedent)), an amount of that Lender s Commitment (equal to the Base Currency Amount of the amount of the participation which is repaid or prepaid) in respect of that Facility will be deemed to be cancelled on the date of repayment or prepayment. 14. INTEREST 14.1 Calculation of Interest The rate of interest on each Loan is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable: (a) Margin; and (b) (i) in relation to any Term Benchmark Loan denominated in Dollars, the Term SOFR Rate for the relevant Interest Period, (ii) in relation to any RFR Loan, the Daily Simple SOFR, (iii) in relation to any Term Benchmark Loan denominated in euro, EURIBOR for the relevant Interest Period or (iv) in relation to any ABR Loan, the Alternate Base Rate. 14.2 Payment of Interest (a) The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan on each Interest Payment Date. (b) If the annual audited financial statements of the Group and related Compliance Certificate received by the Facility Agent show that a higher Margin should have applied during a certain period, then Obligors Agent shall (or shall ensure the relevant Borrower shall) promptly pay to the Facility Agent any amounts necessary to put the Facility Agent and the Lenders in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Margin applied during such period. (c) If the annual audited financial statements of the Group and related Compliance Certificate received by the Facility Agent show that a lower Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the next payment of interest on the relevant Loans shall be reduced by an amount which is equal to the amount of interest paid by the Borrowers during the relevant periods less the amount which would have been payable if the Margin had been decreased to the correct level during the relevant periods as calculated by reference to the relevant annual audited financial statements of the Group.

14.3 Default Interest (a) If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which is one per cent higher than the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan. Any interest accruing under this clause 14.3 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by the Facility Agent. (b) [reserved]. (c) Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable. 14.4 Notification of Rates of Interest The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and the relevant Borrower (or Obligors Agent) of the determination of a rate of interest under this agreement. 14.5 Minimum Interest (a) When entering into this agreement, the parties hereto have assumed that the interest payable at the rates set out in this agreement and any other payments under the Finance Documents are not and will not become subject to Swiss Withholding Taxes. Therefore, each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that the interest rates set out in this agreement shall constitute minimum interest rates. Nevertheless , if a Tax Deduction is required by Swiss law (other than FATCA) to be made by any Obligor in respect of any interest or other payments under a Finance Document and should it be unlawful for such Obligor to comply with Clause 18.2(c) Tax Gross-Up for any reason then: (i) the applicable interest, fee, commission rate in relation to that interest, fee or commission payment shall be: (A) the interest, fee, commission rate which would have applied to that interest, fee or commission payment (as provided for in this agreement or any other Finance Document in the absence of this Clause 14.5), divided by (B) one (1) minus the rate at which the relevant Tax Deduction is required to be made (where the rate at which the relevant Tax Deduction is required to be made is for this purpose expressed as a fraction of (1) rather than as a percentage) (ii) the Obligor shall: (A) pay the relevant interest, fee or commission at the adjusted rate in accordance with paragraph (i) above; and (B) make the Tax Deduction on the interest, fee or commission so recalculated, and (C) all references to a rate of interest, fee or commission in this agreement or any other Finance Document shall be construed accordingly. (b) To the extent that interest, fee or commission payable by an Obligor under a Finance Document becomes subject to Swiss Withholding Tax, each relevant Lender and that Obligor shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities (including 
 108 

submitting forms and documents required by the appropriate tax authority) to the extent possible and necessary for the relevant Obligor to obtain authorization (i) to make interest, fee or commission payments without them being subject to Swiss Withholding Tax, or (ii) to being subject to Swiss Withholding Tax at a rate reduced under applicable double taxation treaties. (c) For the purposes of this clause 14.5, the rate at which the relevant Tax Deduction is required to be made shall mean Swiss withholding tax at the standard rate effective from time to time (( 35 (thirty-five per cent) at the date of this agreement) unless a tax ruling obtained from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration confirms that the rate at which the relevant Tax Deduction is required to be made is, pursuant to any double-taxation treaty, at specified lower rates in relation to specified Lenders in which case such lower rates shall be applied in relation to the relevant Lenders.] 15. INTEREST PERIODS 15.1 Selection of Interest Periods and Terms (a) A Borrower (or Obligors Agent on behalf of a Borrower) may select an Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Loan in the Utilisation Request for that Loan or (if the Term Benchmark Loan is a Term Loan and has already been borrowed) in a Selection Notice. (b) Each Selection Notice for a Term Benchmark Loan must be delivered to the Facility Agent by the Borrower (or Obligors Agent on behalf of the Borrower) to which that Loan was made not later than the Specified Time.

(e) An Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Loan shall not extend beyond the Termination Date applicable to that Loan. (f) Each Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Loan shall start on the Utilisation Date or (if already made) on the last day of its preceding Interest Period. 15.2 [Reserved] 15.3 Non-Business Days If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not). 15.4 Consolidation and Division of Loans 
 109 

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, if two or more Interest Periods: (i) relate to Term Benchmark Loans from the same Term Facility in the same currency; (ii) end on the same date; and (iii) are made to the same Borrower, those Term Benchmark Loans will, unless that Borrower (or Obligors Agent on its behalf) specifies to the contrary in the Selection Notice for the next Interest Period, be consolidated into, and treated as, a single Loan on the last day of the Interest Period. (b) Subject to clause 4.4 (Maximum Number of Utilisations) and clause 5.3 (Currency and Amount), if a Borrower (or Obligors Agent on its behalf) requests in a Selection Notice that a Term Benchmark Loan be divided into two or more Loans, that Loan will, on the last day of its Interest Period, be so divided with Base Currency Amounts specified in that Selection Notice, being an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to the Base Currency Amount of the Loan immediately before its division. 16. CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST 16.1 [Reserved] 16.2 Alternate Rate of Interest (a) Subject to Clause 16.3 (Benchmark Replacement), if: (i) the Facility Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) in consultation with the Obligors Agent (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Loan, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Term SOFR Rate or the EURIBOR (including because the relevant Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis), as applicable , for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Daily Simple SOFR ; or (ii) the Facility Agent and the Obligors Agent are advised by the Majority Lenders that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Loan, the Term SOFR Rate or EURIBOR, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, Daily Simple SOFR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan); provided that a Lender shall not so advise the Facility Agent unless such Lender is generally making similar claims upon, or otherwise similarly enforcing its agreements with, similarly-situated borrowers (and provided further that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose information about any other borrowers); then the Facility Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the relevant Borrower (and Obligors Agent) and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the Facility Agent notifies such Borrower (and Obligors Agent) and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the relevant Borrower delivers a new Selection Notice or a new Utilisation Request, (A) for a Loan denominated in Dollars, (1) any Selection Notice that requests the continuation of any Loan as a Term Benchmark Loan and any Utilisation Request that

Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower s (and Obligors Agent s) receipt of the notice from the Facility Agent referred to in this Clause 16.2(a) with respect to a Benchmark applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Facility Agent notifies the Borrower (and Obligors Agent) and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the relevant Borrower (or Obligors Agent) delivers a new Selection Notice or a new Utilisation Request, (A) for a Loan denominated in Dollars (1) any such Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Facility Agent to, and shall constitute, an RFR Loan so long as the Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of Clause 16.2(a)(i) or (ii) above (y) an ABR Loan if the Daily Simple SOFR for Dollar Loans also is the subject of Clause 16.2(a)(i) or (ii) above, on such day, and (2) any RFR Loan that is subject to Clause 16.2(a)(i) or (ii) above shall on and from such day be converted by the Facility Agent to, and shall constitute an ABR Loan and (B) for a Loan denominated in euro, any Term Benchmark Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day) bear interest at the Central Bank Rate plus the Margin; provided that, if the Facility Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans denominated in euro shall, at the Borrower s (or Obligors Agent s) election prior to such day, (A) be prepaid by the relevant Borrower on such day or (B) solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, such Term Benchmark Loan denominated in euro shall be deemed to be a Term Benchmark Loan denominated in Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans denominated in Dollars at such time. 16.3 Benchmark Replacement (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Finance Document (and any Hedging Agreement shall be deemed not to be a Finance Document for purposes of this Clause 16.3), if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement with respect to Dollars for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Finance Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this agreement or any other Finance Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of Benchmark Replacement for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Finance Document in respect of any Benchmark

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Finance Document, the Facility Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Finance Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this agreement or any other Finance Document.

Accordingly, the Parent and all other Obligors undertake to the Lenders as follows: (a) to comply in all material respects with the terms of the 100 Year Agreements and not do (or omit to do) any act or thing which could reasonably be expected to result in a termination of the 100 Year Agreements or give the right to FIAS or FIAF to terminate the 100 Year Agreements; (b) to ensure that no Group Company agrees to amend, modify or restate any of the 100 Year Agreements or any agreement directly relating to or affecting the 100 Year Agreements which will have the effect of introducing any new or additional termination rights in favour of FIAS, FIAF or any third party if such introduction will: (i) be detrimental in any material respect to any member of the Group; or (ii) result in termination rights arising if any Finance Party demands payment from or accelerates any indebtedness of or takes any Enforcement Action (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) against any Parent Undertaking of SLEC (including enforcing any security over any shares in SLEC or any Parent Undertaking of SLEC); or (iii) otherwise be adverse to the interests of the Finance Parties in any material respect; (c) to notify the Facility Agent promptly and keep the Facility Agent fully informed if there is any deterioration in the financial condition of any Subsidiary of SLEC or any other event which could result in such Subsidiary going into Insolvent Liquidation in the following 12 months (an Insolvency Risk Notification ); (d) following service of an Insolvency Risk Notification, at the request of the Facility Agent to take all reasonable steps to transfer the shares in the Subsidiary the subject of the Insolvency Risk Notification, such that the Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary of a Parent Undertaking of SLEC and ceases to be a Subsidiary (direct or indirect) of SLEC provided that no such action may be required if it would itself be in breach of the 100 Year Agreements; (e) if a breach of the financial covenant set out in clause 26 (Financial Definitions and Financial Covenant) occurs and for so long as it is continuing, the Facility Agent may serve notice in writing on the Parent terminating the right of SLEC and any Subsidiary of SLEC to borrow (a Restricted SLEC Company under any Revolving Facility and under any Ancillary Facility (a Revolver Termination Notice ). Forthwith upon service of a Revolver Termination Notice the rights of SLEC and any Subsidiary of SLEC to make any further borrowings or other Utilisations under any Revolving Facility and any Ancillary Facility will cease. Accordingly, on the next Interest 
 161 

Payment Date applicable to the Revolving Facility Utilisations the existing Revolving Facility Utilisations by a SLEC Company must be refinanced by one or more Utilisations undertaken by another Subsidiary of the Parent (which is not a Restricted SLEC Company) reasonably acceptable to the Facility Agent.

(b) The Parent shall promptly deliver to the Facility Agent copies of any written communications it or any other member of the Group may have with OFAC, the United Nations or any other authority or government agency in the US, the United Kingdom or the European Union in relation to sanctions unless (i) it is of a price sensitive nature that has not yet been publicly announced pursuant to the listing rules of a regulated stock exchange applicable to any direct or indirect shareholder in the Parent, (ii) disclosure to any Finance Party (or any of their respective representatives or contractors) is prohibited by applicable law, (iii) it is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege or constitutes attorney work product or (iv) any Group Company owes confidentiality obligations to any third party that prohibits such disclosure (provided that such confidentiality obligations were not entered into solely in contemplation of this clause (iv)). 27.34 Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act No part of the proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of a political party,

 163

The minimum amount of any New Shareholder Injections provided pursuant to this paragraph required on such re-testing to ensure such financial covenant would then be complied with shall be taken into account in calculating Consolidated EBITDA for the purpose of clause 26.2 (Financial Condition) for each Testing Period (if tested) that ends on the last day of one of the next three Financial Quarters.

 204 

part only) of its rights and obligations under this agreement to a Lender or other bank, financial institution, trust, fund or other entity or person nominated by Obligors Agent and/or the Investors (a Replacement Lender which in each case is acceptable to the Facility Agent (acting reasonably) and (in the case of any transfer of a Revolving Facility Commitment to the extent it is acting as Issuing Bank in respect of the relevant Revolving Facility Commitment) the Issuing Bank, which confirms its willingness to assume and does assume all the obligations of the transferring Lender (including the assumption of the transferring Lender s participations on the same basis as the transferring Lender) for a purchase price in cash payable at the time of transfer equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender s participation in the outstanding Utilisations and all accrued interest and/or Letter of Credit fees, Break Costs and other amounts payable in relation thereto under the Finance Documents; or (B) prepay such Lender s participation in the outstanding Utilisations and all approved interest and/or Letter of Credit fees, Break Costs and other amounts payable in relation thereto under the Finance Documents.

(c) If Obligors Agent or the Facility Agent (at the request of Obligors Agent) has requested the Lenders to consent to a waiver or amendment of any provisions of the Finance Documents and: (i) the waiver or amendment in question requires the consent of the Super Majority Lenders or all the Lenders or all of the affected Lenders or is a Structural Change which requires a particular Lender s consent (as the case may be) and the Majority Lenders have consented to such waiver or amendment; or (ii) the waiver or amendment in question is to be made pursuant to clauses 40.2(b), 40.2(i) or 40.2(j) (Exceptions), is requested from all the Lenders under a particular Facility or participating in a particular Loan or Utilisation and the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility or in respect of that Loan or Utilisation have consented to such waiver or amendment, 
 205 

then any Lender who does not and continues not to agree to such waiver or amendment shall be deemed a Non-Consenting Lender . (d) If a Lender does not accept or reject a waiver on request, its Commitment and/or participations shall not be included for the purposes of calculating the Total Commitments or participations under the relevant Facility when ascertaining whether a certain percentage of Total Commitment and/or participations has been obtained to approve an amendment or waiver provided that this shall not apply if a Lender explicitly abstains from accepting or rejecting a request. 40.4 Technical Amendments Notwithstanding the other provisions of this clause 40: (a) the Facility Agent and Obligors Agent may agree (without the further consent of any other Finance Party) amendments to any Finance Document which in their opinion it would be proper to make provided that any such amendment is not (in the opinion of the Facility Agent) materially prejudicial to the interests of any Lender and is of a formal, minor or technical nature or made to correct a manifest error; and (b) the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith any amendments to any Finance Documents reasonably requested by Obligors Agent in connection with any Permitted Acquisition (whether during a clean-up period or prior to such transaction taking effect) in order to correct any inconsistencies, ambiguities, defects or operational or technical issues arising in the Finance Documents as a result of that transaction, provided that any such amendment is not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Lenders and provided further that nothing in this paragraph (b) shall itself deem a transaction which is not otherwise a Permitted Acquisition to be so permitted. 41.

schedule 8 
 Agreed Security Principles 1. SECURITY PRINCIPLES (i) The guarantees and security to be provided after the Sixth Restatement Date will be given in accordance with the agreed security principles set out in this schedule. This schedule addresses the manner in which the agreed security principles will impact on the guarantees and security proposed to be taken in relation to this transaction. (ii) The Agreed Security Principles embody recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security from all Obligors in every jurisdiction in which Obligors are located. In particular: (a) general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, retention of title claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise; the Parent will use reasonable endeavours to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to each Obligor; (b) the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the cost to the Group of providing security so as to ensure that it is proportionate (in the opinion of the Security Agent, acting reasonably) to the benefit accruing to the Lenders (in particular no security will be granted by any member of the Group which is not a Guarantor or Borrower); (c) any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by this agreement and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from the fixed charge (or equivalent local security) in any relevant security document provided that reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the Obligors if the relevant asset is material; (d) members of the Group not incorporated in the UK will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the relevant Group member shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle; (e) perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Finance Documents therefor or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Finance Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection. The perfection of security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Obligor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents (including, without limitation, notification of receivables security to third party debtors until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Facility Agent has given notice of intention to enforce in accordance with the terms of the relevant credit agreement). The registration of security interests in intellectual property will not be required; 
 239 

(f) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Obligors are not located but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of one Obligor in relation to security granted by another Obligor located in a different jurisdiction; (h) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group; (j) the Security Agent will hold one set of security for the Lenders; and (k) each of the Lenders shall be able to enforce the security constituted by the security documents without any restriction from either (i) the constitutional documents of the relevant Obligor or (ii) any company which is or whose assets are the subject of such security document (but subject to any inalienable statutory rights which the company may have to challenge such enforcement) or (iii) any shareholders of the foregoing not party to the relevant security document. (iii) The Security Agent or the Finance Parties, as the case may be, shall promptly discharge any guarantees and release any Security which is or are subject to any legal or regulatory prohibition as is referred to in paragraph (ii)(d) above. (iv) The Group will not grant security contrary to the 100 Year Agreements. The Obligors will grant security over shares and intercompany loans but a floating charge (in the case of Obligors who are incorporated in England or another jurisdiction where floating charges are a recognised and valid form of security) only will be granted over the other assets. The floating charge will be stated to take effect only to the extent it does not contravene the 100 Year Agreements; and the Security Agent will agree not to enforce the security in a manner that contravenes the 100 Year Agreements and to release security to the extent necessary (in connection with any transfer of Transfer Rights (as defined in the 100 Year Agreements) to FOAM to comply with the provisions of the FOAM articles of association. It is acknowledged that the terms of the Sixth Restatement English Law Debenture comply with the requirements of this paragraph (iv). 2. GUARANTORS AND SECURITY (i) Each guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and for all liabilities of the Obligors in respect of the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction. Transaction Security Documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant security provider or, if such security is provided on a third party basis, all liabilities of the Obligors in respect of the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction. (ii) Where an Obligor pledges shares, the security document will be governed by the laws of the company whose shares are being pledged and not by the law of the country of the pledgor. Subject to these principles the shares owned by Group Companies in each guarantor company (other than the Parent) shall be secured. (iii) To the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favour of the Security Agent and not the Finance Parties individually. Parallel debt provisions will be used where necessary; such provisions will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual Transaction Security Documents unless required under local laws. To the extent possible, there should be no action required to be taken in 
 240 

relation to the guarantees or security when any Lender assigns or transfers any of its participation in the Facilities to a new Lender. (iv) The Guarantors will not be required to pay the cost of any re-execution, notarisation, re-registration, amendment or other perfection requirement for any security on any assignment or transfer to a new Lender. The cost or fee shall be for the account of the transferee Lender. (v) Where an Obligor acquires assets of material value or significance (in the opinion of the Majority Lenders, acting reasonably) after the date on which it initially grants security, such Obligor shall enter into security in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles in respect of such assets to the extent that such assets are of the same type as assets already subject to Transaction Security and such assets are not subject to the existing security created by such Obligor. 3. TERMS OF TRANSACTION SECURITY DOCUMENTS The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken as part of this transaction except to the extent that local counsel to the Facility Agent in any relevant jurisdiction advises that such principles are inconsistent with valid, binding and enforceable security over the assets which are intended to be the subject of the relevant security: (i) the security will be first ranking, to the extent possible; (ii) security will not be enforceable until an Event of Default has occurred which is continuing and notice of acceleration in connection thereof has been given by the relevant Facility Agent in accordance with the terms of the relevant credit agreement; (iii) the Lenders and Hedge Counterparties shall only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing or if the relevant Obligor has failed to comply with a further assurance or perfection obligation; (iv) in the Transaction Security Documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in this agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement such as those relating to notices, cost and expenses, indemnities, tax gross up, distribution of proceeds and release of security other than as required in connection with the perfection of such security; representations and undertakings shall be included in the security documents only to the extent required by local law in order to create or perfect the security interest expressed to be created thereby; (v) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent, required by local law to be provided to perfect or register the security and, when required, shall be provided annually (unless required more frequently under local law) or, following an Event of Default which is outstanding, on the Security Agent s reasonable request; and (vi) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental pledges shall be provided at intervals required under local law). 4. INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES Each Obligor will grant security over its material intercompany receivables, provided that it shall be free to deal with those receivables in the course of its business until an Event of Default has occurred which is continuing and notice of acceleration in connection thereof 
 241 

has been given by the relevant Facility Agent in accordance with the terms of the relevant credit agreement. If required by local law to perfect the security, notice of the security will be served on the relevant debtor promptly upon the security being granted and the Obligor shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection if the service of notice would prevent the Obligor from dealing with an intercompany receivable in the course of its business no notice of security shall be served until an Event of Default has occurred which is continuing and notice of acceleration in connection thereof has been given by the relevant Facility Agent in accordance with the terms of the relevant credit agreement. If required under local law security over intercompany receivables will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. Where any intercompany receivables being secured are governed by the laws of England and Wales, to the extent practicable such security will be granted by way of accession by the charging company to the Sixth Restatement English Law Debenture or otherwise pursuant to another security document the terms of which shall be consistent with the Sixth Restatement English Law Debenture. 5. SHARES The security document will be governed by the laws of the company whose shares are being secured and not by the law of the country of the Obligor granting the security. Until an Event of Default has occurred which is continuing and notice of acceleration in connection therewith has been given by the relevant Facility Agent in accordance with the terms of the relevant credit agreement, the charging Obligor will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights appertaining to any shares charged by it and the company whose shares have been charged will be permitted to pay dividends upstream on pledged shares to the extent permitted under the Finance Documents with the proceeds to be available to the Parent and its subsidiaries. Where customary, immediately upon execution of the share charge, the share certificate and a stock transfer form executed in blank will be provided to the Security Agent and where customary the share certificate or shareholders register will be endorsed or written up and the endorsed share certificate or a copy of the written up register provided to the Security Agent. Unless the restriction is required by law or regulation, the constitutional documents of the company whose shares have been charged will be amended to remove any restriction on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement of the security granted over them. Where the company whose shares are being secured is incorporated in England and Wales, to the extent practicable such security will be granted by way of accession by the charging company to the Sixth Restatement English Law Debenture or the Sixth Restatement English Law Share Charge (where the charging company is not incorporated under the laws of England and Wales) or otherwise pursuant to another security document the terms of which shall be consistent with the Sixth Restatement English Law Share Charge. 6. OTHER TYPES OF ASSETS No security over bank accounts, fixed assets, insurance policies, intellectual property, trade receivables or real estate shall be required other than to the extent provided under a floating charge over all or substantially all of the relevant Obligor s assets (in the case of Obligors 
 242 

who are incorporated in England or another jurisdiction where floating charges are a recognised and valid form of security). 7. ENGLISH LAW DEBENTURE AND ENGLISH LAW SECURITY Any Additional Obligor incorporated in England and Wales shall accede to the Sixth Restatement English Law Debenture (or otherwise accede or enter into another security document the terms of which are consistent with the Sixth Restatement English law Debenture) which is acknowledged to be compliant with any references to a floating charge in these security principles. 8. RELEASE OF SECURITY Unless required by local law the circumstances in which the security shall be released should not be dealt with in individual security documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be the same as those set out in the Intercreditor Agreement or in this agreement.

 (1) A tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or "track" the economic performance of a particular business or "group," rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. 
 On July 18, 2023, the Company completed the split-off (the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off of its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc Atlanta Braves Holdings ). The Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off was accomplished by a redemption by the Company of each outstanding share of Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the corresponding series of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock. Atlanta Braves Holdings is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Braves Group immediately prior to the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off, except for the intergroup interests in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and the Formula One Group, which were settled and extinguished in connection with the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off. On August 3, 2023, the Company reclassified its then-outstanding shares of common stock into three new tracking stocks Liberty SiriusXM common stock, Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock, and, in connection therewith, provided for the attribution of the businesses, assets and liabilities of the Company s remaining tracking stock groups among its newly created Liberty SiriusXM Group, Formula One Group and Liberty Live Group (the Reclassification ). As a result of the Reclassification, each then-outstanding share of Liberty SiriusXM common stock was reclassified into one share of the corresponding series of new Liberty SiriusXM common stock and 0.2500 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Live common stock and each outstanding share of Liberty Formula One common stock was reclassified into one share of the corresponding series of new Liberty Formula One common stock and 0.0428 of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Live common stock. Each of the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and the Reclassification were intended to be tax-free to stockholders of the Company, except with respect to the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. In July 2024, the IRS completed its review of the Reclassification and notified the Company that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. In September 2024, the IRS completed its review of the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and notified the Company that it agreed with the nontaxable characterization of the transaction. The Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and the Reclassification are reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements and these attributed financial statements on a prospective basis. On September 9, 2024, Liberty completed the split-off (the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off of its wholly owned subsidiary, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Liberty Sirius XM Holdings ). The Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off was accomplished through the redemption by the Company of each outstanding share of Liberty SiriusXM common stock in exchange for 0.8375 of a share of Liberty Sirius XM Holdings common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group immediately prior to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off. The Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off was intended to be tax-free to holders of Liberty SiriusXM common stock (except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares). Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is presented as a discontinued operation in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements as the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. While the Formula One Group and Liberty Live Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a public company, such as Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. Live Nation ), in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, the Liberty Live Group. Holders of tracking stock are also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.

Prior to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, the Liberty SiriusXM common stock was intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. At the time of the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, the Liberty SiriusXM Group was comprised of Liberty s interest in Sirius XM Holdings, corporate cash, Liberty s 3.75 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, Liberty s 2.75 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2049 and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. As previously disclosed, Liberty Sirius XM Holdings is presented as a discontinued operation in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Reclassification, Liberty s interest in Live Nation, Liberty s 0.5 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2050 and a margin loan secured by shares of Live Nation were attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and are presented as continuing operations in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off, the Braves Group was primarily comprised of Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club ANLBC and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC s stadium and mixed-use development and cash. As of December 31, 2022, 6,792,903 notional shares represented an 11.0 intergroup interest in the Braves Group previously held by the Formula One Group, 1,811,066 notional shares represented a 2.9 intergroup interest in the Braves Group previously held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group and 4,165,288 notional shares represented a 1.7 intergroup interest in the Formula One Group previously held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group. The intergroup interests represented quasi-equity interests which were not represented by outstanding shares of common stock; rather, the Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed interests in the Braves Group, which were generally stated in terms of a number of shares of Liberty Braves common stock, and the Liberty SiriusXM Group also had an attributed interest in the Formula One Group, which was generally stated in terms of a number of shares of Liberty Formula One common stock. Each reporting period, the notional shares representing the intergroup interests were marked to fair value. The changes in fair value were recorded in the Unrealized gain (loss) on intergroup interests line item in the unaudited attributed condensed consolidated statements of operations. During March 2023, the Formula One Group paid approximately 202 million to the Liberty SiriusXM Group to settle a portion of the intergroup interest in the Formula One Group held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group, as a result of the repurchase of a portion of Liberty s 1.375 Cash Convertible Notes due 2023. On July 12, 2023, the Formula One Group paid approximately 71 million to the Liberty SiriusXM Group to settle and extinguish the remaining intergroup interest in the Formula One Group held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In connection with the Split-Off, the intergroup interests in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and Formula One Group were settled and extinguished through the attribution, to the respective tracking stock group, of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock on a one-for-one basis equal to the number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest. On July 19, 2023, the shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock attributed to the Formula One Group to settle and extinguish the intergroup interest in connection with the Split-Off were distributed on a pro rata basis to holders of Liberty Formula One common stock. During November 2023, Liberty exchanged the shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group with a third party to satisfy certain debt obligations attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group.

 For information relating to investments in affiliates accounted for using the equity method and debt, see notes 7 and 8, respectively, of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. (2) Cash compensation expense for our corporate employees is allocated among the Formula One Group and Liberty Live Group and was allocated to the Braves Group prior to the Atlanta Braves Holdings Split-Off and the Liberty SiriusXM Group prior to the Liberty Sirius XM Holdings Split-Off, based on the estimated percentage of time spent providing services for each group. On an annual basis, estimated time spent is determined through an interview process and a review of personnel duties unless transactions significantly change the composition of companies and investments in either respective group which would require a timelier reevaluation of estimated time spent. Other general and administrative expenses are charged directly to the groups whenever possible and are otherwise allocated based on estimated usage or some other reasonably determined methodology. Stock compensation related to each tracking stock is calculated based on actual awards outstanding. While we believe that this allocation method is reasonable and fair to each group, we may elect to change the allocation methodology or percentages used to allocate general and administrative expenses in the future. 
 (3) The intergroup balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is primarily a result of timing of tax benefits. (4) The Liberty Formula One common stock and Liberty Live common stock have voting and conversion rights under our restated charter. Following is a summary of those rights. Holders of Series A common stock of each group are entitled to one vote per share, and holders of Series B common stock of each group are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of Series C common stock of each group are entitled to 1/100th of a vote per share in certain limited cases and will otherwise not be entitled to vote. In general, holders of Series A and Series B common stock vote as a single class. In certain limited circumstances, the board may elect to seek the approval of the holders of only Series A and Series B Liberty Formula One common stock, or only Series A and Series B Liberty Live common stock. At the option of the holder, each share of Series B common stock of each group will be converted into one share of Series A common stock of the same group. At the discretion of our board, the common stock related to one group may be converted into common stock of the same series that is related to another other group.
