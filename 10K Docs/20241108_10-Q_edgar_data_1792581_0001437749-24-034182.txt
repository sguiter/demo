Our future business development, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our expected timing of human clinical trials and other related milestones. 

Expected changes in our revenue, costs or expenditures. 

Our ability to obtain financing in amounts sufficient to fund our operations and continue as a going concern and avoid seeking protection under Chapters 7 or 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. 

Difficulties or delays in the product development process, including the results of preclinical studies or clinical trials. 

Difficulties or delays in the regulatory approval process.

Table of Contents 

The following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied in our forward-looking statements: 

The effectiveness and timeliness of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the usefulness of the data. 

Our expectations regarding the timing and clinical development of our product candidates. 

Our ability to achieve profitable operations and access to needed capital. 

Fluctuations in our operating results. 

The success of current and future license and collaboration agreements.

The risks set forth under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q describe major risks to our business, and you should read and interpret any forward-looking statements together with these risks. A variety of factors, including these risks, could cause our actual results and other expectations to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed, anticipated or implied in our forward-looking statements. Should known or unknown risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected in the forward-looking statements. You should bear this in mind as you consider any forward-looking statements. 
 
 Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the dates on which they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes makes it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in such statements will not be realized, except as may be required by law.

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , and an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024 . To date, the Company has relied on equity and debt financing to fund its operations. The Company s product candidates are still in the early stages of clinical trials and development, and substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and ongoing research and development efforts prior to the commercialization, if any, of its product candidates. The Company does not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity to meet its obligations through the twelve months following the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Given its projected operating requirements and its existing cash and cash equivalents, management s plans include evaluating different strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations. These plans may include, but are not limited to, additional funding from private or public equity or debt offerings with current or new investors. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such additional financing, or if available, that it will be sufficient to meet its needs or on favorable terms. Therefore, the plans cannot be deemed probable of being implemented. As a result, the Company has concluded management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In the event the Company is unable to secure financing sufficient to allow it to meet its obligations as they become due, the Company may need to file a voluntary petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a restructuring plan or liquidation. 

The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful economic life of the specific asset.

to months. When nonvested options are vested, they become exercisable over a -year period from grant date. 
 
 The vesting conditions for RSAs include cliff vesting conditions. Certain RSUs vest with a range of to months. When RSUs vest, they are released to the grantee within sixty days. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock compensation expense related to the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan and the Omnibus 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . The Company measures and recognizes stock compensation expense for all stock based awards, including stock options, based on estimated fair values recognized using cliff vesting or the straight line method over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model (the Black Scholes model ). The calculation of stock based compensation expense requires that the Company make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the Black Scholes model, including the fair value of the Company s common stock, expected term, expected volatility of the underlying common stock, and risk free interest rate. Forfeitures are accounted for when they occur. 
 
 The Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes model and the assumptions used to value such stock options are determined as follows: 
 
 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that the Company s stock options are expected to be outstanding. Due to limitations on the sale or transfer of the Company s common stock under the lock-up agreements and market standoff components of the stock option agreements, the Company does not believe its historical exercise pattern is indicative of the pattern it will experience after restricted periods expire. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate the expected term, which is the average of the contractual term and vesting period. 
 
 Risk Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk free interest rate used in the Black Scholes model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a term equivalent to that of the expected term of the stock options for each stock option group. 
 
 Volatility. The Company determines the price volatility based on the historical volatilities of industry peers as it has limited trading history for its common stock price. The Company intends to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or a similar peer group of public companies, until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own common stock price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified peer companies are no longer similar, in which case other suitable peer companies whose common stock prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. 
 
 Dividend Yield. The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company s current expectations about its anticipated dividend policy. To date, the Company has not declared any dividends and, therefore, the Company has used an expected dividend yield of . 
 
 Common Stock Valuations . The closing price listed on the OTCQB Capital Market or previously the NASDAQ Capital Market for the Company s common stock on the date of the grant is used as the common stock valuation.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , there were restricted stock units and warrants that were excluded from the computations of diluted weighted-average shares of common stock because they were anti-dilutive. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company entered into three exchange agreements (the "Exchange Agreements"). The first agreement reclassified convertible promissory notes with million of principal into shares of Series D convertible voting preferred stock (the Series D Stock ). The second agreement reclassified (i) convertible promissory notes with million of principal and (ii) accrued interest of million for a total of million into shares of Series D Stock. The third agreement reclassified (i) convertible promissory notes with million of principal and (ii) accrued interest of million for a total of million into shares of Series E Stock.

The notes are each 25 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes with largely consistent terms including a stated interest rate of per year; and a one -year maturity. The Notes are convertible at varying conversion prices. 
 
 The stated interest rates for these notes increase to per annum or the highest rate then allowed under applicable law (whichever is lower) upon the occurrence of an event of default, including the failure by the Company to make payment of principal or interest due under the related note on the respective maturity date, and any commencement by the Company of a case under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law. 

In April 2023, July 2023, March 2024, June 2024 and September 2024, the Company executed an exchange agreement to reclassify million, million, million of the Notes' principal, and million and million of the Notes' principal and interest into shares of convertible preferred stock, respectively.

 On January 31, 2024, the Chancery Court issued a letter opinion that dismissed Terrell s claims based on the contract-interpretation grounds the Company originally advanced back in 2021, as well as the Delaware Supreme Court s determination that the third options agreement was not unconscionable. On March 11, 2024, the Chancery Court entered a stipulated form of Final Order and Judgment, dismissing Terrell s claims consistent with the Chancery Court s January 31, 2024, letter opinion. Terrell thereafter commenced an appeal of the dismissal to the Delaware Supreme Court. Pursuant to the briefing schedule ordered by the Delaware Supreme Court, Terrell filed its opening appellate brief on May 9, 2024; and the Company filed its answering brief on June 25, 2024. Oral argument in the Delaware Supreme Court appeal took place on October 30, 2024, and the parties are awaiting the Court's decision.

Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company authorized the issuance of and shares of Series C Convertible Voting Preferred Stock (the Series C Stock ), respectively, and shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series E Stock , the Series D Stock and together with the Series C Stock, the Preferred Shares ), respectively. The Company issued shares of Series C Stock on April 2, 2023, shares of Series C Stock on July 18, 2023, shares of Series D Stock on March 28, 2024, shares of Series D Stock on June 21, 2024, and shares of Series E Stock on September 27, 2024, as part of five agreements to reclassify convertible preferred notes for Preferred Shares. 
 
 As discussed in Note 3, the Company reclassified certain CPNs into convertible preferred shares by executing the Exchange Agreements. This reclassification resulted in two new classes of convertible preferred shares in 2024, the Series D and Series E Stock. The Company has three classes of convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding for both balance sheet dates presented - Series C Stock, Series D Stock and Series E Stock. The Preferred Shares are convertible, upon a notice of conversion by the holder, into shares of the Company's common stock, par value per share at an exchange price of per share for the Series C Stock, for the Series D Stock and a price equal to of the 5 -day VWAP for the Common Stock beginning on the fifth day preceding the date of the Notice of Conversion for the Series E Stock, subject to a beneficial ownership maximum of . The Preferred Shares are voting stock and holders are entitled to vote together with the Common Stock on an as-if-converted-to-Common-Stock basis as determined by dividing the Liquidation Preference with respect to such shares of Preferred Shares by their conversion price. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Accordingly, holders of Preferred Shares are entitled to one vote for each whole share of Common Stock into which their Preferred Shares are convertible on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. 
 
 Cumulative Rights of Series C, D and E Stock Shareholders The Preferred Shares accumulate undeclared dividends at an annual rate of . Unpaid dividends and undeclared dividends are added to the aggregated Liquidation Preference which also includes the face value of the Preferred Shares outstanding. In the event of any liquidation of the Company, holders of Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid the Liquidation Preference out of the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, before any payment shall be made to the holders of any other shares of capital.

for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The Company recorded income tax provision for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 The provision for income taxes during the interim reporting periods is calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to ordinary income or loss for the reporting period. Each quarter, the estimate of the annual effective tax rate is updated, and if the estimated effective tax rate changes, a cumulative adjustment is made. There is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors, including changes in the mix of the pre-tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates, changes in tax laws, business reorganizations and settlements with taxing authorities. 
 
 The income tax rates vary from the US federal statutory rate of primarily due to the full valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets. The Company has recorded the full valuation allowance based on an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including latest forecasts and cumulative losses in recent years. The Company has concluded that it was more likely than not that none of its deferred tax assets would be realized.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our plans and financial condition . The following financial information is derived from our unaudited financial statements and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and notes thereto included in this report and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Our Business 
 
 Overview 
 
 Kiromic BioPharma, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company is an allogeneic Gamma Delta T-cell therapy company featuring unique, proprietary, end-to-end bioinformatic, AI targeting, and manufacturing technologies to address solid tumors. Our end-to-end approach consists of target discovery and validation, product development, and on-site current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP ), which we believe will allow us to leverage a new framework for the next generation of cell therapies. 
 
 We currently have three product candidates: 1) Deltacel, non-engineered GDTs, expanded and activated with proprietary technology; 2) Isocel GDTs engineered with an anti-Mesothelin isoform Chimeric Antigen Receptor; and 3) Procel, GDTs engineered with a PD-1 switch receptor. 
 
 We are developing a novel and virus-independent engineering method, which we believe will result in the submission of new IND applications. The first of these applications will study Isocel and is expected to be ready for submission to the FDA in the second half of 2025. The second will study Procel and is expected to be ready for submission to the FDA in 2026. The development of both technologies and their advancement to clinical stage are subject to sufficient financing. Depending on evidence from preclinical studies, we may study the new candidates in combination with low-dose radiation or as stand-alone therapies. 
 
 We have not generated any revenue from sales to date, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not and have never been profitable and have incurred losses in each period since we began principal business operations in 2012. As discussed in more detail below, we are currently in discussions with financing sources in an attempt to secure short-term financing to continue operations and fund other liquidity needs through the end of the year. In the absence of such financing, management anticipates that existing cash resources will not be sufficient to meet operating and liquidity needs beyond December 2024. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Going Concern and Liquidity 
 
 We do not have sufficient cash on hand and available liquidity to meet our obligations through the twelve months following the date the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Therefore, this condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans were updated to evaluate different strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations. These plans may include, but are not limited to, additional funding from current or new investors, inclusive of a potential public offering of equity; however, if we are unable to raise additional funding to meet working capital needs, we will be forced to delay or reduce the scope of our research programs and/or limit or cease operations. The negative cash flows and lack of financial resources raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, and that substantial doubt has not been alleviated. See Note 1 to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Going Concern for further details. 
 
 Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were 2.92 million as of September 30, 2024. We are currently in discussions with financing sources in an attempt to secure short-term financing to continue operations and fund other liquidity needs through 12 months after the date of the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We are working with a financial advisor to assist us with our efforts to obtain financing. In the absence of such financing, management anticipates that existing cash resources as of September 30, 2024, will not be sufficient to meet our operating and liquidity needs beyond December 2024. However, management may further evaluate additional cost reduction actions, including additional reductions in our workforce and delay of research and development expenditures on one or more product candidates, in order to reduce our current expenditures and preserve cash. In addition, we are seeking to relist on to the NASDAQ or another major stock exchange in order to increase the liquidity of our stock. We are not able to predict whether any such cost reduction or major stock exchange listing actions will be successful. 
 
 As a result of our current liquidity position, management can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If financing is available, it may not be on favorable terms and may have a significant dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. In the event we are unable to secure financing sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations as they become due, we may need to file a voluntary petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code in order to implement a restructuring plan or liquidation. See Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details.

Financing Update 
 
 In 2024, we executed monthly CPNs to finance our operations and executed three Exchange Agreements to strengthen our balance sheet by reclassifying CPNs to preferred shares. Please see Note 7 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note, Note 10 Stockholders' Equity and Note 13 Subsequent Events for more information. 
 
 Clinical Update 
 
 In the second half of 2022, we started the development of Deltacel, our novel, non-engineered GDT cell product based on a proprietary methodology of expanding and activating GDT cells from healthy donors. We submitted the IND application for the Deltacel-01 trial in March 2023. On April 28, 2023, the FDA authorized us to proceed with the study. We began the clinical trial activation process during the second quarter of 2023. On October 23, 2023, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with Beverly Hills Cancer Center (BHCC) to conduct our Deltacel-01 Phase 1 Study in patients with stage 4 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 
 
 On December 13, 2023, the first patient in the Deltacel-01 trial received the first dose of Deltacel at BHCC. So far, six patients received the Deltacel treatment. As of September 2024, we have registered a 6-month median Progression Free Survival (PFS) with a median length of follow-up of over 7 months and the longest PFS of 10 months. 
 
 None of the enrolled patients developed a dose-limiting toxicity. The Deltacel-01 study, encompassing long-term follow-up, spans up to 24 months. This trial consists of two parts: Part 1 is designed to identify the optimal dose of Deltacel. Following approval by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), Part 2 (the Expansion Phase) is designed to further assess the therapy s effectiveness at the optimal dose identified in Part 1. Based on the promising survival benefits in the absence of limiting toxicities, we activated the Expansion Phase in September 2024, and the first patient in this phase started treatment in October 2024. We expect that a total of approximately 9 patients will be enrolled in the expansion phase, and that enrollment will be completed by year-end. 
 
 The following table shows a summary of the results from the first 6 subjects enrolled in the Deltacel-01 clinical trial:

Throughout 2024, we have activated an additional four testing sites: 

February 28, 2024, Virginia Oncology Associates, PC, located in Norfolk, VA; 

April 8, 2024, Texas Oncology, located in Tyler, TX; 

May 8, 2024, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center located in Pittsburgh, PA; 

September 19, 2024, the University of Arizona Cancer Center located in Tucson, Arizona. 

On June 18, 2024, we submitted a Fast-Track Designation (FTD) Application to the FDA. The FTD status was granted on August 9, 2024. We believe this is a significant milestone for the clinical development of our Deltacel product candidate, as FTD facilitates and expedites the development and review of drugs that treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs. This is achieved through benefits such as Accelerated Approval, Rolling Review, and Priority Review, which collectively accelerate the approval process. Therefore, we believe that receiving an FTD for our Deltacel product will significantly accelerate our pathway to approval, as FTD status can give us access to the following: 

More frequent meetings with FDA to discuss our clinical development plan and ensure the collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval 

More frequent written communication from FDA about the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers 

Eligibility for Accelerated Approval 

Eligibility for Priority Review 

Rolling Review, which means that we will be allowed to submit completed sections of its Biologic License Application (BLA) for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the BLA is completed before the entire application can be reviewed. Without Rolling Review, BLA review does not begin until the entire application has been submitted to the FDA 

On October 1, 2024, based upon our insights from the favorable results of the first phase of our trial, we submitted an IND protocol amendment to the FDA that includes changes in the study to further improve our therapeutic approach and the benefits for the patients. The changes became effective on November 1, 2024. 
 
 Depending on the response rates registered during our Deltacel-01 Phase 1 clinical trial, in the second half of 2025 we may be able to initiate a registrational Phase 2 trial to support a Biologics License Application (BLA) to accelerate the clinical development of Deltacel.

We plan to continue the development of Isocel and Procel once we gather sufficient financial support. We expect to be able to submit the Isocel IND in the second half of 2025, and the Procel IND in the second quarter of 2026. 
 
 Results from our Internal Review 
 
 On or about August 17 and 23, 2021, Tony Tontat, who at the time was the Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board of Directors the Board ), submitted substantially identical reports (the Complaints through our complaint hotline. These Complaints, alleged, among other topics, risks associated with our public disclosures in our securities filings and in statements made to the public, investors, and potential investors regarding (i) the anticipated timing of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s FDA authorization of our investigational new drug IND applications and (ii) the anticipated timing of human clinical trials. These Complaints were subsequently submitted to the Audit Committee of the Board. 
 
 After receiving the Complaints, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board form, and the Board did in turn form, a Special Committee comprised of three independent directors (the Special Committee to review the Complaints and other related issues (the Internal Review ). The Special Committee retained an independent counsel to assist it in conducting the Internal Review. As previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Internal Review concluded on February 2, 2022, and the remedial actions taken by the Company in response to the Internal Review are set forth in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Upon completion of the Internal Review, we voluntarily contacted the SEC to report certain information about the Internal Review. Since that time, we have been voluntarily cooperating with requests for information from the SEC and intend to fully cooperate with any further requests from the SEC. 
 
 In November 2022, we received a Grand Jury Subpoena (the Subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain information from the company in connection with an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Federal Grand Jury in the Southern District of Texas. We are not a target of this investigation at this time. 
 
 Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance 
 
 Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors: 

Clinical trials discontinuation for any or a combination of the following reasons: commercial or strategic decision, lack of efficacy, poor recruitment. 

Slow or delayed IND applications. 

Slow or delayed clinical trial enrollment. 

Patent reinforcement and prosecution. 

Changes in laws or the regulatory environment affecting our company. 

Emerging Growth Company 
 
 We qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: 

Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 

Submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and 

Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 

23

Table of Contents 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, which was October 15, 2020, (b) the date in which our total annual gross revenues exceed 1.07 billion, or (c) the date in which we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (ii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales in the foreseeable future. We will record revenue from collaboration agreements, including amounts related to upfront payments, annual fees for licenses of our intellectual property and research and development funding. However, none of those agreements have been executed as of the issuance date of this report. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates. These include the following: 

Salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; 

Expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations and other third parties that conduct preclinical research and development activities and clinical trials on our behalf; 

Costs of developing and scaling our manufacturing process and manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and future clinical trials, including the costs of contract manufacturing organizations, that will manufacture our clinical trial material for use in our preclinical studies and potential future clinical trials; 

Costs of outside consultants, including their fees and related travel expenses; 

Costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 

License payments made for intellectual property used in research and development activities; and 

Facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs if specifically, identifiable to research activities. 

Research and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will comprise a larger percentage of our total expenses as we initiate Phase 1 clinical trials for our Isocel and Procel product candidates and continue to discover and develop additional candidates. However, management is currently evaluating various cost reduction actions, including suspending research and development expenditures on one or more product candidates, in order to reduce our expenditures and preserve cash. As of the date of this quarterly report, we are not able to predict on what product candidates and how much expenditure we plan to reduce. However, we expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase over the long-term, even if we are able to successfully reduce our costs in the short-term in order to preserve cash in light of our current liquidity situation. 

24

Table of Contents 

We cannot determine with certainty the duration and costs of future clinical trials of our Deltacel, Procel, and Isocel product candidates, or any other product candidate we may develop or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our Isocel and Procel product candidates and any other our trial candidate we may develop will depend on a variety of factors, including: 

The scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of our Isocel and Procel trial candidates, as well as of any future clinical trials of other product candidates and other research and development activities that we may conduct; 

Uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; 

The actual probability of success for our product candidates, including their safety and efficacy, early clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability; 

Significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; 

The expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and 

Our ability to effectively address the deficiencies elucidated in the FDA s clinical hold letters for our IND applications related to key chemical manufacturing and control components. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in our clinical trials due to slower than expected patient enrollment or other reasons, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation for personnel in our executive, finance, business development, operations and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services; insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs that are not specifically attributable to research activities. 
 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our personnel headcount to support our continued research activities, development, and manufacturing of product candidates. We also have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with OTCQB and SEC requirements; director and officer insurance costs; and investor and public relations costs.

The primary drivers for the increase in research and development expenses are as follow: 

a- 
 Isocel development cost decreased due to the leverage of full-time employees rather than outside consulting services. 

b- 
 Employee related costs increased due to an increase in employee headcount, and executive bonuses. 

c- 
 Laboratory supplies and services increased due to the prioritization of the Deltacel-01 development to support preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

d- 
 Outsourced research and development also increased due to the prioritization of the Deltacel-01 development to support preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

e- 
 Laboratory equipment and maintenance decreased due to a decline in purchase of supplies and other lab related materials during the quarter. 

f- 
 Facility-related costs increased due to repairs and maintenance expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 3.06 million, which included 132 thousand of restricted cash. We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of our convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock, common stock from the initial public offering and follow-on offering. 
 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.15 million, which included 132 thousand of restricted cash. We have material contractual obligations which will require cash to meet their requirements. These applicable obligations include our facility lease agreement, our employment contracts, and our financing arrangement for our Director and Officer Insurance Policy. We also plan to deploy cash for other research and development and general and administrative operating expenses. Our ability to continue meeting these contractual obligations will be reliant upon our ability to secure significant additional capital funding. 
 
 As described above under Going Concern and Liquidity, in the absence of financing, management anticipates that existing cash resources combined with verbal, non-contractual commitments for additional financing will not be sufficient to meet operating and liquidity needs beyond December 2024. Management may further evaluate various cost reduction actions, including possible reductions in our workforce and suspending research and development expenditures on one or more product candidates, in order to reduce our expenditures and preserve cash. We are limited in our ability to reduce expenditures for known contractual obligations. As a result, we are not able to predict whether any cost reduction actions will be successful or how much longer any such actions will allow us to continue to operate without financing.

Table of Contents 

As previously disclosed, we have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will increase over the long-term, even if we are able to successfully reduce our costs in the short-term in order to preserve cash in light of our current liquidity situation. These costs include conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates, contracting with clinical research organizations and building out internal capacity to have product candidates manufactured to support preclinical studies and clinical trials, expanding our intellectual property portfolio and providing general and administrative support for our operations. As a result, substantial doubt exists regarding the going concern assumption on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Therefore, these condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We are currently seeking short-term financing to be able to continue our operations. If we are successful in obtaining short-term financing to fund our operations beyond the end of the year, we intend to seek significant additional capital funding to develop our platform, hire scientific professionals and other general and administrative employees, and for clinical trials. However, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that, in the event that they are successful, the terms and conditions of any such financings will be favorable. Further, there are other factors which may make financing our operations more difficult, including potential governmental investigation, continued elevated legal and accounting professional fees associated with litigation, and other risk factors listed in Item 1A. of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In consideration of our plans, substantial doubt is not alleviated.

Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is driven primarily by the increase in overall spending in research and development due to the development of Deltacel combined with an overall increase in headcount. See our discussion in Results of Operations and our Statement of Cash Flows for more information. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 338 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 98.0 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of cash flows for purchases of property and equipment for our cGMP facilities located in our leased facility in Houston, Texas, and for the purchases of internal use software. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in cash flows from financing activities for the periods shown are driven by the issuance of 19.5 million of convertible notes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements for any of the periods presented. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Under the supervision, and with the participation, of our current management, including our CEO and Principal Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including our CEO and Principal Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 Information related to Item 1. Legal Proceedings is included in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 except as indicated below. 
 
 Our principal stockholder has significant influence over the election of our board of directors and approval of any significant corporate actions, including any sale of the company. 
 
 We have a principal stockholder who beneficially owns a substantial amount of our outstanding stock through securities convertible into our outstanding stock, consisting of certain convertible promissory notes and shares of our Series C Convertible Voting Preferred Stock, Series D Convertible Voting Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Voting Preferred Stock. Each of these convertible securities contains beneficial ownership limitations equivalent to 19.99 . However, upon 61 days notice to the company, the principal stockholder can increase or remove the beneficial ownership limitations. If the principal stockholder were to remove the beneficial ownership limitations, the principal stockholder would beneficially own over 90 of our outstanding stock. This stockholder currently has, and likely will continue to have, significant influence with respect to the election of our board of directors and approval or disapproval of all significant corporate actions, including a potential merger or sale of the company or its assets, which may occur at times or on terms that are undesirable to other stockholders. The concentrated voting power of this stockholder could also have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or another significant corporate transaction. The interests of the principal stockholder may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders, and the principal stockholder may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.
