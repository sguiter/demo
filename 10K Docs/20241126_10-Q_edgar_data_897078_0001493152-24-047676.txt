from a share-for-share structure to a share-for-asset structure would be beneficial to each of the parties. 

By
the Reformation Agreement, share-for-share structure of the Exchange Agreement was reformed to become a share-for-asset structure (the

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with
the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s most recent Annual Financial Statements filed with
the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair
presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results
of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial
statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal
period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted. 

Going
concern 

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going
concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
As of September 30, 2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of . The company s ability to continue as a going
concern is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable
operations. While the Company is expanding its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity
will generate funds that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. 

allowance for
doubtful accounts and bad debts. 

Revenue
is deferred when the Company receives payment under a contract with a customer prior to satisfying its performance obligation. As the
majority of orders are processed and shipped immediately upon receipt of payment, it is rare that revenue is deferred. There was deferred
revenue as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Significant
payment terms The Company s contracts with its customers state the final terms of the sale, including the description,
quantity, and price of each product purchased. Payments are typically due prior to delivery. Since the customer agrees to a stated rate
and price in the contract that do not vary over the contract, the Company s contracts do not contain variable consideration. Economic
factors - The Company s revenues and accounts receivable are derived primarily from the United States with no particular concentration
in any industry. Sales revenue is impacted by overall economic conditions, as there are fewer sales when the Company s customers
are impacted by negative economic conditions. Returns, refunds, and warranties The Company has a 30-day return policy on all
products. As the amount of returned product is minimal, management believes that returns on any goods sold subsequent to September 30,
2024, and 2023, were not material. 

. Expenditures for renewals or betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance
are charged to expense as incurred the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the
accounts, and any gain or loss thereon is reflected in operations. Company policies capitalize property and equipment for cost over ,

On

company, and Entourage Labs, LLC, a California limited liability company (collectively, Resonate Blends, LLC and Entourage Labs, LLC

Conveyance Agreement, we assigned our ownership in the Subsidiary to Mr. Selzer. .

that any capital, including through convertible loan transactions, will be available to us in the future or, if available, on terms acceptable
to us . The terms of the recently obtained loans are discussed below.

Company has the right to repay the Vollintine Note at any time. The Vollintine Note is convertible at any time and from time to time
into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price that shall equal to .035; provided, however, that, upon an event
of default, the conversion price shall be the lower of (a) .035 or (b) the volume weighted average trading price during the previous
20 trading-day period ending on the date of issuance of the Vollintine Note or during the previous 20 trading-day period ending on the
relevant conversion date, whichever is lower.

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of 1,044,236 (unaudited), consisting of 68,236 (unaudited) in cash, 6,000 loan
receivable and 970,000 (unaudited) in advances to former acquisition partner-company. Our total current liabilities as of September
30, 2024, were 4,557,634 (unaudited). Our working capital deficit was 3,513,398 (unaudited) as of September 30, 2024, compared to our
working capital deficit of 2,150,975 (unaudited) as of December 31, 2023. 

Going
Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have an accumulated deficit of 28,292,170 (unaudited). Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent
upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations. While
we are expanding our best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will
be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

In
December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices in the Management Discussion
and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a
company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often
as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies
are disclosed in Note 2 of our audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material
weaknesses identified and described below. 

Our
principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although
our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal
executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed
in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Remediation
Plan to Address the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Management identified the following three material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude that, as of
September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures, and our internal control over financial reporting, were not effective at
the reasonable assurance level: 

1. 
 We
 do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls
 over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of the period ending June 30, 2024. Management
 evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our
 disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2. 
 We
 do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and
 nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent
 possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate
 individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls
 and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

3. 
 Effective
 controls over the control environment were not maintained. Specifically, a formally adopted written code of business conduct and
 ethics that governs our employees, officers, and directors was not in place. Additionally, management has not developed and effectively
 communicated to employees its accounting policies and procedures. This has resulted in inconsistent practices. Further, our Board
 of Directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as
 defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization,
 management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness. 

To
address these material weaknesses, management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements
included herein fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

To
remediate the material weakness in our documentation, evaluation and testing of internal controls we plan to engage a third-party firm
to assist us in remedying this material weakness once resources become available. 

We
intend to remedy our material weakness with regard to insufficient segregation of duties by hiring additional employees in order to segregate
duties in a manner that establishes effective internal controls once resources become available. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

No
change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the period ended
September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
