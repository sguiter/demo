SEAFARER
 EXPLORATION CORP. 
 
 NOTES
 TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 (Unaudited) 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Seafarer Exploration Corp. Seafarer or the Company are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary
to fairly state the Company s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the dates and periods presented.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial information. 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements and footnotes included in the Company s Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the Commission on March 26, 2024. The results of operations for the nine month period ended September
30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future
period. 

as of September 30, 2024. During the nine month period
ended September 30, 2024, the Company s net loss was and at September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit
of . These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on its historical
rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than three months from November 14, 2024. Management s
plans include raising capital through the issuance of common stock and debt to fund operations and, eventually, the generation of revenue
through its business. The Company does not expect to generate any significant revenues for the foreseeable future. The Company is in
immediate need of further working capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination
thereof. 

Failure
to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The Company s
ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of the common stock is unknown. Additionally, even if the Company does
raise sufficient capital to support its operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no assurances that the revenue
will be sufficient to enable it to develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows from operations. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern; however, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classifications of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern. 

Convertible
Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are currently
in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on the assets
held as collateral for the obligations arising under the secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the assets held
as collateral, then the Company may be forced to significantly scale back or cease its operations which would more than likely result
in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company is in default regarding
several loans held by various lenders makes investing in the Company or providing any loans to the Company extremely risky with a very
high potential for a complete loss of capital. 

The
convertible notes that have been issued by the Company are convertible at the lender s option. These convertible notes represent
significant potential dilution to the Company s current shareholders as the convertible price of these notes is generally lower
than the current market price of the Company s shares. As such when these notes are converted into equity there is typically a
highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and very high probability that such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading
price of the Company s common stock. Furthermore, management intends to have discussions with several of the promissory note holders
who do not currently have convertible notes regarding converting their notes into equity. Any such amended agreements to convert promissory
notes into equity would more than likely have a highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and there is a very high probability that
such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading price of the Company s common stock. 

See
Note 5 Convertible notes payable in default, Convertible notes payable related parties, in default, Notes payable
 in default, Notes payable related parties, in default, for further information regarding the Company s convertible
notes payable and notes payable that are currently in default due to non payment of principal and interest. 

Current
Economic Conditions 

The
Company and certain of its advisors are closely monitoring current domestic economic conditions. The Federal Reserve (the Fed recently discussed that while inflation growth has moderated in 2024, prices remain high for many goods and services. The Company s
vessels use large amounts of fuel when in operation and higher prices gasoline have caused an increase in the Company s operating
expenses. The high cost of fuel may hamper the Company s ability to conduct operations. Furthermore, even though inflation has
moderated in 2024 and has retreated from recent high, if inflation were to reignite then the Company may see increased expenses that
would severely hamper the Company s ability to continue its operations which would likely lead to a complete loss of all capital
invested in and/or loaned to the Company. 

.
At September 30, 2024, the Company had deposits that were in excess of the FDIC insured limit. 

and 
for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and and for the three month periods ended

with base month rents of from August 1, 2023 to June 31, 2024 and from August 1, 2024 to July 31, 2025. Under

Shareholder
Loan 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had the following loans outstanding to its CEO in the total amount of 5,000 as
follows: 

- 
 A
 loan with no due date with a 1,500 remaining balance and an interest rate of 2 and a conversion rate of 0.0005; and 

- 
 A
 loan due on September 9, 2022 with a remaining balance of 3,500, and an interest rate of 1 . 

Collateralized
Promissory Notes 

Two
convertible notes outstanding with related parties, dated January 9, 2009 and January 18, 2012 are collateralized by Company assets. 

Convertible
Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are currently
in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on the assets
held as collateral for the obligations arising under the secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the assets held
as collateral, then the Company may be forced to significantly scale back or cease its operations, which would more than likely result
in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company is in default of several
promissory notes held by various lenders makes investing in the Company or providing any loans to the Company extremely risky with a
very high potential for a complete loss of capital. The Company s convertible notes payable and notes payable in default represent
a very significant risk to the viability of the Company.

following discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties, and
which speak only as of the date of this annual report. No one should place strong or undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The
use in this Form 10-Q of such words as believes , plans , anticipates , expects ,
 intends , and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of
identifying such statements. The Company s actual results or actions may differ materially from these forward-looking statements

and business conditions; competition; success of operating initiatives; our ability to raise capital and the terms thereof; changes in
business strategy or development plans; future revenues; the continuity, experience and quality of our management; changes in or failure
to comply with government regulations or the lack of government authorization to continue our projects; and other factors referenced
in the Form 10-Q. This Item should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the

to us at the time such statements were made. Forward looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, which
could cause actual events or results to differ from those reflected in the forward looking statements, including, without limitation,
the failure to successfully locate cargo and artifacts from shipwreck sites and a number of other risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, either as a result of the matters set forth or incorporated
in this Report generally and certain economic and business factors, some of which may be beyond our control. 

We
disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such
statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. 

Overview 

General 

The
Company s principal business plan is to develop the infrastructure and technology to engage in the rescue archaeology and archaeologically-sensitive
exploration, recovery and conservation of historic shipwrecks and to eventually monetize the recovery of the shipwrecks without selling
the treasure by creating revenue through media and technology alternatives for different industry sectors. Once artifacts have been properly
conserved, they may be made available for scientific research and allowed to be displayed for the public. The Company s secondary
business is to attempt to develop revenue streams to support its historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations. Such revenue
streams will complement the technology developed by Seafarer or potentially be media related although no such revenue has materialized. 

The
Company has received from the Florida Department of State a notice of lack of authority to permit or deny recovery activities on the
unidentified shipwreck on Juno Beach. The Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research (the Bureau ), Division of Historical
Resources, Florida Department of State stated to Seafarer The shipwreck is non-permittable pursuant to Rule 1A-31.0045(2), F.A.C. The
Bureau cited an order dated November 14, 2017 where the United States District Court entered a Final Order of Court
Default and Final Judgement Granting Award for Admiralty in Rem. The District Court s order ruled Seafarer is hereby the
true, sole, and exclusive owner of the Defendant Shipwrecked Vessel and having exclusive right to conduct recovery operation on the Defendant
Shipwrecked Vessel and any items recovered therefrom. Additional permitting was received from the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 

In
order to potentially find more efficient methods to explore and document historical shipwrecks, the Company has investigated various
technologies and non-scientific methodologies. To the present date, none of these technologies have been proven to work with the
exception of the SeaSearcher, which has been developed to scan historic shipwreck sites for both ferrous and nonferrous artifacts.
Although the Company believes that the SeaSearcher has shown some efficacy, the technology has been hampered by a number of
technical issues that have limited its use in the field and that have caused significant down time. The ongoing developmental work
and improvements to the SeaSearcher have been expensive and Management anticipates that significant expenses for these development
costs will continue to be incurred for the foreseeable future. Advances in algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) will continue
indefinitely while the present model can be currently used in the field with some limitations due to periodic technical issues. The
Company will continue to experiment with unproven technologies and will actively work with third parties, consultants and scientists
to develop its own proprietary technology which has and will result in considerable expenses. 

The
Company continues to review revenue producing opportunities including joint ventures and partnerships with other companies and potentially
governmental agencies. 

There
is a possibility that the Company will be forced to cease its operations if it is not successful in eventually locating and recovering
valuable artifacts and treasure or can t build a revenue stream to offset its expenses. If the Company were to cease its operations,
and not find or engage another business entity, then it is likely that there would be complete loss of all capital invested in or borrowed
by the Company. As such, an investment in Seafarer is highly speculative and very risky. 

25 

This
type of business venture is highly speculative in nature and carries an excessive amount of risk. An investment in the Company s
securities is very risky and should only be considered by those investors or lenders who do not require liquidity and who can afford
to suffer a complete and total loss of their investment. 

There
is currently a limited trading market for the Company s securities. It is impossible for the Company to assure that when and if
an active-trading market in its shares will be established, or whether any such market will be sustained or sufficiently liquid to enable
holders of shares of the Company s common stock to liquidate their investment in our company. 

The
sale of restricted securities by current shareholders, including shares issued to consultants, independent contractors, Board members,
as well as shares issued to settle convertible promissory notes or to settle other loans and debt, are highly dilutive and may cause
a significant decline in the market price of the Company s securities. Furthermore, in recent years regulatory agencies have made
it very difficult for broker dealers to accept stock certificates from issuers of low priced stocks and the Company believes that it
may become even more challenging to deposit stock certificates and this trend may continue for the foreseeable future. 

Moreover,
in the past few years several major brokerage firms have indicated that they will not allow their clients to deposit stock certificates
of low priced stocks. Some securities clearing firms who used to clear low priced securities for multiple brokerage firms have shut down
or been acquired, resulting in fewer brokerage firms that are willing or able to accept lower priced securities for deposit. Unless an
investor has a large and well-established relationship with a brokerage firm, it may be extremely difficult and potentially expensive
to deposit lower priced securities. An investor should consider consulting with professional financial advisers before making an investment
in our securities. The Company is a current and fully reporting company. 

Plan
of Operation 

The
Company has taken the following steps to implement its business plan: 

To
date, the Company has devoted its time towards establishing its business to develop the infrastructure capable of researching, exploring,
recovering and conserving historic shipwrecks. The Company has performed some research, exploration and recovery activities. 

Spent
considerable time and capital researching potential shipwrecks, including obtaining information from foreign archives. 

The
Company has worked in combination with its technology development partner, Wild Manta Labs, to build a research and conservation lab
with full x-ray equipment and detailed metal identification analysis. 

The
Company has generated very limited revenues to date. Management does not believe that the Company will generate any significant revenues
for the foreseeable future. 

The
Company continues to review revenue producing opportunities including joint ventures with other companies. The Company is actively looking
to work with revenue producing companies. These opportunities have been slow to develop, but the Company will continue to pursue those
endeavors that it believes have the potential to increase the value of the Company s shares. 

The
Company has investigated various types of equipment and technology to expedite the process of finding artifacts other than iron or ferrous
metals. Most have been of no help, but the Company continues to explore new technologies. The Company has developed its own proprietary
technology, the SeaSearcher, and will attempt to continue to develop additional proprietary technologies or work with third parties to
develop technologies to aid in its exploration and recovery operations. Development of technologies will require additional time and
financing. The cost of developing the new technology has, to date, been very expensive for a small company. 

The
Company has investigated media opportunities to develop content centered on its specific historic shipwreck exploration and recovery
activities as well as the historic shipwreck and related historical period genre in general and will continue to evaluate various media
strategies. 

Other
Information 

There
are very strict international, federal and state laws that govern the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. While the Company
has been able to obtain some permits, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure future permits or enter into agreements
with government agencies in order to explore and salvage historic shipwrecks. Seafarer believes they are the only company to be issued
a full recovery permit by FBAR since 1986, other than one entity with an Admiralty Claim. This demonstrates the difficulty of obtaining
a recovery permit from FBAR. There is a risk that government entities may enact legislation that is so strict that any recovery of artifacts
and cargo from historic shipwrecks will be nearly impossible. Additionally, permits and agreements with governmental agencies to conduct
historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations are expensive, in terms of both direct costs and ongoing compliance costs. It
is also possible that the Company will not be successful in obtaining title or permission to excavate certain wrecks, even if the law
allows it. It is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued,
may not be legal or honored by the entities that issued them. For the above reasons, the Company has extended its research into shipwrecks
outside of State waters.

It
is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued, may not be legal
or honored by the entities that issued them. Governmental agencies may require various types of permits to explore shipwreck sites, and
the permitting process is often lengthy and complex. Obtaining permits and entering into agreements with governmental and quasi-governmental
agencies to conduct historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations is generally a very complex, time consuming, and expensive
process. Furthermore, the process of entering into agreements and/or obtaining permits may be subject to lengthy delays, possibly in
excess of a year. Some governmental agencies may refuse to issue permits to the Company for recovery of artifacts or intentionally delay
the permitting process, or go beyond their authority and request halting of ground disturbance. 

The
reasons for a lengthy permitting process are myriad and may be due to a number of potential factors including but not limited to requests
by permitting agencies for additional information, submitted applications that need to be revised or updated, newly discovered information
that needs to be added to an application or agreement, changes to either the agreement or permit terms or revisions to other information
contained in the permit, excessive administrative time lags at permitting agencies, work halts based on biased predispositions with no
authority given by rule 1A-31, etc. Existing permits and agreements may be put on hold or suspended without notice for lengthy periods
of time due to administrative issues and disagreements over the terms and conditions. The length of time it takes to obtain permits,
enter into agreements, or rectify any conditions that are causing a permit to be suspended or on hold may cause the Company to expend
significant resources while gearing up to do work with little or no visibility as to timing. 

The
Company regularly reviews opportunities to perform exploration and recovery operations at purported historic shipwreck sites. The Company
currently does have some specific plans to perform exploration and recovery operations at other shipwreck sites in the future, however
these plans are subject to change based on a number of factors. The Company is actively reviewing other potential historic shipwreck
sites, including sites located internationally, for possible exploration and recovery. Should the Company decide that it will pursue
exploration and recovery activities at other potential shipwreck sites, it may be necessary to obtain various permits as well as environmental
permits. 

The
Company continually monitors media rights for potential revenue opportunities. The Company has had discussions with media entities to
further understand the potential advantages offered. Management believes various forms of media can represent a potential future revenue
opportunity for the Company, if the right circumstances arise. 

This
type of business venture is extremely speculative in nature and carries a tremendous amount of risk. An investment in the Company s
securities is highly speculative and very risky and should only be considered by those investors or lenders who do not require near-term
liquidity and who can afford to suffer a complete and total loss of their investment. 

Results
of Operations 

Since
inception, we have generated only minimal revenue from operations and do not expect to report any significant revenue from operations
for the foreseeable future. We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability
and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

The
Company expects to continue to incur significant operating losses and to generate negative cash flow from operating activities, while
building out its infrastructure in order to explore and salvage historic shipwreck sites and establishing itself in the marketplace.
Based on our historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than three months from November
14, 2024. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital deficits of 2,459,269 and 1,808,783, respectively. The Company s
working capital deficit, along with its lack of meaningful cash flows from operations with which to service the debt, indicates that
there is substantial risk to the continued viability of the Company. The Company is in immediate need of further working capital and
is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. 

Since
inception, the Company has funded its operations through common stock issuances and loans in order to meet its strategic objectives;
however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain further funds to continue with its efforts to establish a
new business. There is a very significant risk that the Company will be unable to obtain financing to fund its operations and as such
the Company may be forced to cease operations at any time which would likely result in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested
in and/or borrowed by the Company to date. 

The
Company s ability to eliminate operating losses and to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future will depend upon
a variety of factors, many of which it is unable to control. If the Company is unable to implement its business plan successfully, it
may not be able to eliminate operating losses, generate positive cash flow or achieve or sustain profitability, which may have a material
adverse effect on the Company s business, operations, and financial results, as well as its ability to make payments on its debt
obligations, and the Company may be forced to cease operations. 

If
the Company is unable to secure additional financing, our business may fail and our stock price will likely be materially adversely affected.
The Company s lack of operating cash flow and reliance on the sale of its common stock and loans to fund operations is extremely
risky. If the Company is unable to continue to raise capital or obtain loans or other financing on terms that are acceptable to the Company,
or at all, then it is highly likely that the Company will be forced to cease operations. If the Company ceases its operations, then it
is highly likely that all capital invested in and/or borrowed by the Company will be lost.

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses were 2,664,502 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 2,238,001 for the same period in 2023, an increase
of 17 . The overall increase in operating expenses in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in consulting and contracting expenses and
research and development expenses. Although the growth in the rate of inflation has moderated somewhat in 2024, the elevated price environment
has continued to pressure costs relating to many of the Company s expenses. Consulting and contractor expense was 1,424,204 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 1,291,709 for the same period in 2023, an increase of nearly 10 . Rising labor
costs have increased expenses associated with consulting and contracting expenses. The Company incurred vessel related expenses of 178,720
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus 292,690 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease
of approximately 137 . The Company s vessels have not required as much repairs in 2023 which has led to lower vessel related expenses.
During the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, professional fees were 136,487 as compared to 106,678 during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately 28 . Professional fees fluctuate based on the use of professional service
providers, in particular in relation to various legal matters. Research and development expenses were 399,292 in 2024 versus 193,621
in 2023, an increase of approximately 102 . The increase in the Company s research and development expenses were related to the
ongoing development of its SeaSearcher autonomous underwater device and development of related technology including a handheld metal
discriminator. The Company believes that it will continue to expend significant resources to further develop the SeaSearcher and to begin
developing next generation versions of the technology. Research and development expenses are expected to fluctuate based on the adoption
of technological advances and upgrades into the existing SeaSearcher platform and the availability of financing. During the nine month
period ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were 322,723 as compared to 258,009 during the nine month period
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 25 . Depreciation and amortization expense was 37,531 during the nine month period ended September
30, 2024 and 36,347 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Rent expense was 33,187 during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2024 versus 30,813 for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 8 . The Company incurred travel and entertainment
expenses of 132,350 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 73,034 during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2023, an approximate 81 increase. Entertainment and travel expenses may fluctuate due to inflationary increase in costs
and general corporate activity, including travel to and from the Juno Beach historic shipwreck location and lodging expenses for personnel. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

Other
income (expense) was (407,024) during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus (77,612) during the nine month period ended
September 30, 2023. The 506 increase in other expense in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in interest expenses and extinguishment
of debt. Interest expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was 218,770 versus 54,564 for the same period in 2023,
an increase of approximately 300 . Interest expense increased in 2024 due to the amortization of debt discounts and increase in convertible
notes payable and notes payable. Loss on extinguishment of debt was 196,774 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 versus
 23,049 during the same period in 2023, an increase of 754 . The increase in the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2024 was due to the
conversion of the principal balance and accrued interest on convertible notes payable. 

Net
Loss 

The
Company s net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3,061,742, and 2,360,023, respectively, a year-over-year
increase of approximately 30 .

30 

Lack
of Liquidity 

A
major financial challenge and significant risk facing the Company is a lack of positive cash flow and liquidity. The Company continued
to operate with significant debt and a working capital deficit during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. This working capital
deficit indicates that the Company is unable to meet its short-term liabilities with its current assets. This working
capital deficit is extremely risky for the Company as it may be forced to cease its operations due to its inability to meet its current
obligations. If the Company is forced to cease its operations, then it is highly likely that all capital invested in and/or borrowed
by the Company will be lost. 

The
expenses associated with being a small publicly traded company attempting to develop the infrastructure to explore and salvage historic
shipwrecks recovery are extremely prohibitive, especially given that the Company does not currently generate any significant revenues
and does not expect to generate any significant revenues in the near future. There are ongoing expenses associated with operations that
are incurred whether the Company is conducting shipwreck recovery operations or not. Vessel maintenance, upkeep expenses and docking
fees are continuous and unavoidable regardless of the Company s operational status. Management anticipates that the vessels utilized
by the Company in its operations will need continuous and unavoidable repairs and maintenance, particularly if the Company ramps up its
operational footprint and is working on more than one site simultaneously as anticipated. These repairs and maintenance are expensive
and have a negative impact on the Company s cash position. 

In
addition to the operation expenses, a publicly traded company also incurs the significant recurring corporate expenses related to maintaining
publicly traded status, which include, but are not limited to accounting, legal, audit, executive, administrative, corporate communications,
rent, telephones, etc. The recurring expenses associated with being a publicly traded company are very burdensome for smaller public
companies such as Seafarer. This lack of liquidity creates a very risky situation for the Company in terms of its ability to continue
operating, which in turn makes owning shares of the Company s common stock extremely risky and highly speculative. The Company s
lack of liquidity may cause the Company to be forced to cease operations at any time which would likely result in a complete loss of
all capital invested in or borrowed by the Company to date. 

Due
to the fact that the Company does not generate any revenues and does not expect to generate revenues for the foreseeable future it must
rely on outside equity and debt funding. The combination of the ongoing operating expenses that must be met even during times when there
is little or no exploration or recovery activities taking place, and corporate expenses, creates a very risky situation for the Company
and its shareholders in terms of the need to access external financing to fund operations. This working capital shortfall and lack of
access to cash to fund corporate activities is extremely risky and may force the Company to cease its operations which would more than
likely result in a complete loss of all capital invested in or loaned to the Company to date. 

Lack
of Revenues and Cash Flow/Significant Losses from Operations 

The
exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks requires a multi-year, multi-stage process and it may be many years before any significant
revenue is generated from exploration and recovery activities, if ever. The Company does not believe that it will generate any significant
revenues in the near future. The Company believes that it may be several years before it is able to generate any cash flow from its operations,
if any are ever generated at all. Without revenues and cash flow the Company does not have reliable cash flow to pay its expenses. The
Company relies on outside financing in the form of equity and debt and it is possible that the Company may not be able to obtain outside
financing in the future. If the Company is not able to obtain financing it would more than likely be forced to cease operations and all
of the capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company would be lost. 

If
the Company is unable to secure additional financing, our business may fail or our operating results and our stock price may be materially
adversely affected. The raising of additional financing would in all likelihood result in dilution or reduction in the value of the Company s
securities. 

The
Company may not be able to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not able to continue as a going concern, it is highly likely
that all capital invested in the Company or borrowed by the Company will be lost. The report of our independent auditors for the years
ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, we have experienced
operating losses in every year since our inception resulting in an accumulated deficit. If the Company is not able to continue as a going
concern, it is highly likely that all capital invested in the Company or borrowed by the Company will be lost. 

The
Company has experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since inception. The Company s losses from operations were 2,654,718 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2,282,411 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The Company believes
that it will continue to generate losses from its operations for the foreseeable future and the Company may not be able to generate a
profit in the long-term, or ever. 

31 

Convertible
Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are currently
in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on the assets
held as collateral for the obligations arising under the secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the assets held
as collateral, then the Company may be forced to significantly scale back or cease its operations which would more than likely result
in a complete loss of all capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company is in default regarding
several loans held by various lenders makes investing in the Company or providing any loans to the Company extremely risky with a very
high potential for a complete loss of capital. 

The
convertible notes that have been issued by the Company are convertible at the lender s option. These convertible notes represent
significant potential dilution to the Company s current shareholders as the convertible price of these notes is generally lower
than the current market price of the Company s shares. As such when these notes are converted into equity there is typically a
highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and very high probability that such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading
price of the Company s common stock. Furthermore, management intends to have discussions or has already had discussions with several
of the promissory note holders who do not currently have convertible notes regarding converting their notes into equity. Any such amended
agreements to convert promissory notes into equity would more than likely have a highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and there
is a very high probability that such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading price of the Company s common stock.
Some of these note holders have already amended their notes and converted the notes into equity. Based on conversations with other note
holders, the Company believes that additional note holders will amend their notes to contain a convertibility clause and eventually convert
the notes into equity. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments which affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities (see Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies, contained
in the notes to the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine month periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 contained in this filing). On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates based upon different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. 

Management
is aware that certain changes in accounting estimates employed in generating financial statements can have the effect of making the Company
look more or less profitable than it actually is. Management does not believe that the Company has made any such changes in accounting
estimates.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Management s
Responsibility for Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial
reporting. The Company s controls over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of the Company s Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is accumulated and
communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer/principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize and report financial information required to be included on
our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of
ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result of our evaluation and review process, management believes
that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

32 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operations of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and based on the criteria for effective internal control described in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (as revised). Based on our evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize
and report financial information required to be included on our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports due to
the Company s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. However, as a result
of our evaluation and review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are
materially correct. 

Management,
including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures, or
its internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of
the control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 

The
Company has limited resources and as a result, a material weakness in financial reporting currently exists, because of our limited resources
and personnel, including those described below. 

The
Company has an insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal controls.
As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. 

We
have not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to key financial reporting functions. 

We
do not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an audit
committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it is Management s view that to have an audit committee, comprised of
independent board members, and an independent audit committee financial expert is an important entity-level control over the Company s
financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditing standard 5) or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
has determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company s limited resources
and personnel. 

Remediation
Efforts to Address Deficiencies in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
a result of these findings, management, upon obtaining sufficient capital and operations, intends to take practical, cost-effective steps
in implementing internal controls, including the possible remedial measures set forth below. As of September 30, 2024 we did not have
sufficient capital and/or operations to implement any of the remedial measures described below: 

Assessing
the current duties of existing personnel and consultants, assigning additional duties to existing personnel and consultants, and, in
a cost effective manner, potentially hiring additional personnel to assist with the preparation of the Company s financial statements
to allow for proper segregation of duties, as well as additional resources for control documentation. 

Assessing
the duties of the existing officers of the Company and, in a cost effective manner, possibly promote or hire additional personnel to
diversify duties and responsibilities of such executive officers. 

Board
