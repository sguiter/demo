LIGHTSTONE VALUE PLUS REIT III, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share/unit data and where indicated in millions) (Unaudited) 

 general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership s common units. 

Lightstone REIT III and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company and the use of we, our, us or similar pronouns in these consolidated financial statements refers to Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 

Through the Operating Partnership, the Company owns, operates and develops commercial properties and makes real estate-related investments. Since its inception, the Company has primarily acquired, developed and operated commercial hospitality properties, principally consisting of limited-service hotels and one full-service hotel all located in the U.S. Although the Company has historically acquired hotels, it has and may continue to purchase other types of real estate. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical/life sciences office buildings. The Company s real estate investments are held by it alone or jointly with other parties. In addition, the Company may invest up to 20 of its net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which it may acquire directly. Although most of its investments are these types, the Company may invest in whatever types of real estate or real estate-related investments that it believes are in its best interests. The Company evaluates all of its real estate investments as one operating segment. The Company currently intends to hold its investments until such time as it determines that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve its investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company (i) wholly owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of eight limited service hotels containing a total of 872 rooms, (ii) held an unconsolidated 50 membership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture ), which owns one limited service hotel, and (iii) held an unconsolidated 25 membership interest in Bedford Avenue Holdings LLC (the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture ), which owns one full service hotel. The Company accounts for its unconsolidated membership interests in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting. 

The Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture owns a 183-room, limited-service hotel (the Hilton Garden Inn Long Island City located in the Long Island City neighborhood in the Queens borough of New York City. The Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture developed, constructed and owns a 216-room branded hotel (the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel located in the Williamsburg neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, which opened on March 7, 2023. Both the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture are between the Company and related parties. 

The Company s advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC (the Advisor ), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor also owns shares of our common stock Common Shares which were issued on December 24, 2012 for , or per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is a majority owner of the equity interests of the Lightstone Group, LLC (the Sponsor ), which served as the Company s sponsor during its initial public offering (the Offering which terminated on March 31, 2017. Mr. Lichtenstein owns Common Shares which were issued on December 11, 2014 for 2.0 million, or per share. Pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement and subject to the oversight of the Company s board of directors (the Board of Directors ), the Advisor has primary responsibility for making investment decisions on behalf of the Company and managing its day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of the Sponsor, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Special Limited Partner ), which owns subordinated participation interests Subordinated Participation Interests in the Operating Partnership which were acquired at a cost of per unit, or an aggregate consideration of million in connection with the Offering. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT III or the Operating Partnership. 

The Company has no employees. The Company is dependent on the Advisor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor for performing a full range of services that are essential to it, including asset management, property management (excluding its hospitality properties, which are each managed by an unrelated third party property manager) and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities, such as tax, accounting, legal, information technology and investor relations services. If the Advisor and its affiliates are unable to provide these services to the Company, it would be required to provide the services itself or obtain the services from other parties. 

The Company s Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The Company may seek to list its Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of its independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Company does not intend to list its Common Shares at this time. The Company does not anticipate that there would be any active market for its Common Shares until they are listed for trading. 

Noncontrolling Interests Partners of the Operating Partnership 

Limited Partner 

On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed 2 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert limited partner units into cash or, at the Company s option, an equal number of its Common Shares. 

Special Limited Partner 

In connection with the Company s Offering, the Special Limited Partner purchased from the Operating Partnership an aggregate of 242 Subordinated Participation Interests at a cost of 50,000 per unit, or aggregate consideration of 12.1 million. 

As the indirect majority owner of the Special Limited Partner, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a 99 interest in such Subordinated Participation Interests and will thus receive an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof. 

These Subordinated Participation Interests may entitle the Special Limited Partner to a portion of any regular distributions that the Company makes to its stockholders, but only after its stockholders have received a stated preferred return. However, from inception through September 30, 2024, there have been no distributions declared on the Subordinated Participation Interests. Any future distributions on the Subordinated Participation Interests will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return. 

The Subordinated Participation Interests may also entitle the Special Limited Partner to a portion of any liquidating distributions made by the Operating Partnership. The value of such distributions will depend upon the net proceeds available for distribution upon the Company s liquidation and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time. Liquidating distributions to the Special Limited Partner will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a distribution equal to their initial investment plus a stated preferred return. 

Related Parties 

The Company s Advisor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor, including the Special Limited Partner, are related parties of the Company as well as the other public REITs also sponsored and/or advised by these entities. Pursuant to the terms of various agreements, these entities are entitled to compensation and reimbursement for services and costs incurred for services related to the investment, development, management and disposition of the Company s assets. The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements. 

 general partnership interest in the common units of the Operating Partnership. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, interests in entities acquired are evaluated based on applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP ), and entities deemed to be variable interest entities VIE in which the Company is the primary beneficiary are also consolidated. If the interest in the entity is determined not to be a VIE, then the entity is evaluated for consolidation based on legal form, economic substance, and the extent to which the Company has control, substantive participating rights or both under the respective ownership agreement. For entities in which the Company has less than a controlling interest or entities which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, it accounts for the investment using the equity method of accounting. 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and related notes as contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc. and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 

GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to the valuation of real estate and depreciable lives. Application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. 

The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein has been derived from the consolidated balance sheet included in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

The unaudited consolidated statements of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year or any other period.

The Company and Lightstone REIT II each have a co-managing membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. The Company accounts for its membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting because it exerts significant influence over but does not control the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. All capital contributions and distributions of earnings from the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to each member s equity interest percentage.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recognized an allowance for expected credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities as the Company has not identified any unrealized losses for these investments attributable to credit factors. The Company s unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds was primarily caused by recent rising interest rates. The Company does not intend to sell the investment and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. 

The Company may sell certain of its investments in marketable debt securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The
Company s mutual funds were classified as Level 1 assets and the Company s preferred equity securities, corporate bonds
and interest rate cap contract were classified as Level 2 assets. There were no transfers between the level classifications during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The fair values of the Company s investments in mutual funds are measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and its preferred equity securities and corporate bonds are measured using readily available quoted prices for these securities; however, the markets for these securities are not active. The fair value of the Company s interest rate cap contract is measured using other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities with stated contractual maturity dates, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities:

The Company did not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities, which would require revised valuations that are recognized at fair value.

Business and Structure 

Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc. Lightstone REIT III ), is a Maryland corporation formed on October 5, 2012, which elected to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2015. 

Lightstone REIT III is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT UPREIT ), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership ). As of September 30, 2024, Lightstone REIT III had a 99 general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership s common units. 

Lightstone REIT III and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company and the use of we, our, us or similar pronouns in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 

Through the Operating Partnership, we own, operate and develop commercial properties and make real estate-related investments. Since our inception, we have primarily acquired, developed and operated commercial hospitality properties, principally consisting of limited-service hotels and one full-service hotel all located in the U.S. However, our commercial holdings may also to a lesser extent, consist of retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), industrial and office properties. Our real estate investments are held by us alone or jointly with other parties. In addition, we may invest up to 20 of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly. Although most of our investments are these types, we may invest in whatever types of real estate or real estate-related investments that we believe are in our best interests. We evaluate all of our real estate investments as one operating segment. We currently intend to hold our investments until such time as we determine that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met. 

23 

As of September 30, 2024, we (i) wholly owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of eight limited service hotels containing a total of 872 rooms, (ii) held an unconsolidated 50 membership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture ), which owns one limited service hotel, and (iii) held an unconsolidated 25 membership interest in Bedford Avenue Holdings LLC (the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture ), which owns one full service hotel. We account for our unconsolidated membership interests in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting. 

The Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture owns a 183-room, limited-service hotel (the Hilton Garden Inn Long Island City) located in the Long Island City neighborhood in the Queens borough of New York City. The Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture developed, constructed and owns a 216-room branded hotel (the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel located in the Williamsburg neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, which opened on March 7, 2023. Both the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture are between us and related parties. 

Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC (the Advisor ), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed 2 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. Our Advisor also owns 20,000 shares of our common stock Common Shares which were issued on December 24, 2012 for 200, or 10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of the Lightstone Group, LLC (the Sponsor ), which served as our sponsor during our initial public offering (the Offering which terminated on March 31, 2017. Mr. Lichtenstein owns 222,222 Common Shares which were issued on December 11, 2014 for 2.0 million, or 9.00 per share. Pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement and subject to the oversight of our board of directors (the Board of Directors ), the Advisor has primary responsibility for making investment decisions on our behalf and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of the Sponsor, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Special Limited Partner ), which owns 242 subordinated participation interests Subordinated Participation Interests in the Operating Partnership which were acquired at a cost of 50,000 per unit, or for aggregate consideration of 12.1 million in connection with our Offering. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT III or the Operating Partnership. 

We have no employees. We are dependent on the Advisor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor for services that are essential to us, including asset management, property management (excluding our hospitality properties, each of which are managed by an unrelated third-party property manager) and acquisition, disposition, development and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities; such as tax, accounting, legal, information technology and investor relations services. If the Advisor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor are unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide the services ourselves or obtain the services from other parties. 

Our Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not intend to list our Common Shares at this time. We do not anticipate that there would be any active market for our Common Shares until they are listed for trading. 

Noncontrolling Interests Partners of the Operating Partnership 

Limited Partner 

On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed 2 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert its limited partner units into cash or, at our option, an equal number of our Common Shares. 

24 

Special Limited Partner 

In connection with our Offering, the Special Limited Partner purchased from the Operating Partnership an aggregate of 242 Subordinated Participation Interests for 50,000 per unit, or aggregate consideration of 12.1 million. 

As the indirect majority owner of the Special Limited Partner, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a 99 interest in such Subordinated Participation Interests and thus receives an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof. 

These Subordinated Participation Interests may entitle the Special Limited Partner to a portion of any regular distributions that we make to our stockholders, but only after our stockholders have received a stated preferred return. However, from inception through September 30, 2024, there have been no distributions declared on the Subordinated Participation Interests. Any future distributions on the Subordinated Participation Interests will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return. 

The Subordinated Participation Interests may also entitle the Special Limited Partner to a portion of any liquidating distributions made by the Operating Partnership. The value of such distributions will depend upon the net proceeds available for distribution upon our liquidation and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time. Liquidating distributions to the Special Limited Partner will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a distribution equal to their initial investment plus a stated preferred return. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of U.S. federally insured levels. We regularly monitor the financial stability of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash. 

Current Environment 

Our operating results and financial condition are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced by market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility and banking failures, political upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, inflation and recession. 

Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impacts on consumer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, increases in costs due to inflation, higher interest rates, labor and supply chain challenges and other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our future results from operations and our financial condition. 

We are not currently aware of any other material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from our operations, other than those referred to above or throughout this Form 10-Q. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period.

The following information generally applies to our investments in our real estate properties: 

we believe our real estate properties are adequately covered by insurance and suitable for their intended purpose; 

our real estate properties are located in markets where we are subject to competition; and 

depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the applicable improvements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates 

There were no material changes during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to our critical accounting policies as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year
ended December 31, 2023. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the three months
ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 

Consolidated 

Our consolidated revenues, property
operating expenses, real estate taxes, general and administrative expense and depreciation and amortization for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 are attributable to our consolidated hospitality properties, all of which were owned by us during the entire
periods presented. 

During the three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period in 2023, our consolidated hospitality portfolio experienced increases in RevPAR
to 101.58 from 100.90 and ADR to 136.67 from 135.09 while the percentage of rooms occupied slightly declined to 74 from 75 . 

Revenues 

Revenues increased slightly by 0.1
million to 8.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.3 million for the same period in 2023.
The favorable impact on our revenues during the 2024 period was a result of higher RevPAR and ADR, partially offset by the slight decline
in occupancy. 

Property operating expenses 

Property operating expenses were unchanged
at 5.5 million during both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Real estate taxes 

Real estate taxes were unchanged at
 0.3 million during both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

General and administrative expense 

General and administrative expenses
decreased slightly by 0.1 million to 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.7 million
for the same period in 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense
decreased by 0.2 million to 0.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 million for the
same period in 2023. 

27 

Interest expense 

Interest expense decreased slightly
by 0.1 million to 1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million for the same period
in 2023. Interest expense is attributable to the financings associated with our hotels and reflects changes in the weighted average
principal outstanding and the market interest rates on our mortgage debt, all of which bears interest at variable rates. 

Loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliated
real estate entities 

Our loss from investments in unconsolidated
affiliated real estate entities was 0.1 million and 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Our earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entities are attributable to our unconsolidated 50 membership
interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and our unconsolidated 25 membership interest Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture. 

Comparison of the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 vs. September 30, 2023 

Consolidated 

Our consolidated revenues, property
operating expenses, real estate taxes, general and administrative expense and depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 are attributable to our consolidated hospitality properties, all of which were owned by us during the entire
periods presented. 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period in 2023, our consolidated hospitality portfolio experienced increases in the percentage
of rooms occupied to 73 from 71 , RevPAR to 94.86 from 92.20 and ADR to 130.83 from 129.40. 

Revenues 

Revenues increased by 0.8 million
to 23.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.6 million for the same period in 2023. The
favorable impact on our revenues during the 2024 period was a result of higher occupancy, RevPAR and ADR. 

Property operating expenses 

Property operating expenses increased
by 0.3 million to 15.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.2 million for the same period
in 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to the higher occupancy during the 2024 period and also reflects higher franchise and
management fees resulting from the increase in revenues discussed above. 

Real estate taxes 

Real estate taxes increased slightly
by 0.1 million to 1.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.9 million for the same period
in 2023. 

General and administrative expense 

General and administrative expenses
increased slightly by 0.1 million to 2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million
for the same period in 2023. 

Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense
decreased by 0.8 million to 2.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.3 million for the same
period in 2023. 

28 

Interest expense 

Interest expense was unchanged at 4.0
million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Interest expense is attributable to the financings associated
with our hotels and reflects changes in the weighted average principal outstanding and the market interest rates on our mortgage
debt, all of which bears interest at variable rates. 

Loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliated
real estate entities 

Our
loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entities was 1.9 million and 2.8 million during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entities are attributable
to our unconsolidated 50 membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and our unconsolidated 25 membership interest Williamsburg
Moxy Hotel Joint Venture. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview : 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 6.8
million of cash on hand and 5.5 million of marketable securities. We believe that these items along with revenues generated from our
properties, interest and dividend income earned on our marketable securities and distributions received from our unconsolidated affiliated
real estate entities, if any, will be sufficient to satisfy our expected cash requirements for at least twelve months from the date of
filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which primarily consist of our anticipated operating expenses, scheduled debt service
(excluding balloon payments due at maturity), capital expenditures (excluding non-recurring capital expenditures), capital contributions
to our unconsolidated affiliated real estate entities, redemptions and cancellations of Common Shares and distributions to our shareholders,
if any, required to maintain our status as a REIT for the foreseeable future. However, we may also obtain additional funds, if necessary,
through selective asset dispositions, proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities, joint venture arrangements, new borrowings
and refinancing of existing borrowings. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had mortgage
indebtedness totaling 57.4 million. We have and intend to continue to limit our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75 of the
aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is
disclosed to our stockholders. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings
may be less than 75 of aggregate fair market value of all properties. We may also incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of
two years or less. 

Our
charter provides that the aggregate amount of our borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300 of net assets in the absence
of a justification showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of our Board of Directors and disclosure to stockholders.
Net assets mean our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves less our total
liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over such 300 of net assets level
must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders,
along with justification for such excess. Market conditions will dictate our overall leverage limit; as such our aggregate borrowings
may be less than 300 of net assets. As of September 30, 2024, our total borrowings were 57.4 million which represented 57 of our net
assets. 

Any future properties that we may acquire or develop may be funded through a combination of borrowings and the proceeds received from the disposition of certain of our assets. These borrowing may consist of single-property mortgages as well as mortgages cross-collateralized by a pool of properties. Such mortgages may be put in place either at the time we acquire a property or subsequent to our purchasing a property for cash. In addition, we may acquire properties that are subject to existing indebtedness where we choose to assume the existing mortgages. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to encumber our properties with non-recourse debt. This means that a lender s rights on default will generally be limited to foreclosing on the property. However, we may, at our discretion, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. When we give a guaranty for a property-owning entity, we will be responsible to the lender for the satisfaction of the indebtedness if it is not paid by the property-owning entity. 

29 

We may also obtain lines of credit to be used to acquire properties. If obtained, these lines of credit will be at prevailing market terms and will be repaid from proceeds from the sale or refinancing of properties, working capital and/or permanent financing. Our Sponsor and/or its affiliates may guarantee our lines of credit although they are not obligated to do so. We expect that such properties may be purchased by our Sponsor s affiliates on our behalf, in our name, in order to minimize the imposition of a transfer tax upon a transfer of such properties to us. 

We have an advisory agreement with the Advisor and various agreements with certain affiliates of our Sponsor which provide for us to pay certain fees in exchange for services performed by them on our behalf. Additionally, our ability to secure financing and our real estate operations are dependent upon our Advisor and certain affiliates of our Sponsor to perform such services as specified in these agreements. 

In addition to meeting working capital needs and making distributions, if any, to maintain our status as a REIT, our capital resources are used to make various payments to our Advisor and certain affiliates of the Sponsor, such as payments of fees related to asset acquisition, development and leasing commissions, asset management fees, and property management (excluding our hospitality properties, each of which is managed by an unrelated third party property manager), as well as the reimbursement of acquisition related expenses and actual expenses it incurred for administrative and other services provided to us. Additionally, in the event of a liquidation of our assets, we may pay our Advisor or certain affiliates of our Sponsor, disposition fees. Furthermore, the Operating Partnership may be required to make distributions to the Special Limited Partner provided stockholders receive a distribution equal to their initial investment plus a stated preferred return. During the first quarter of 2024, the Advisor agreed to allow us to temporarily defer the payment of asset management fees. 

The advisory agreement has a one-year term and is renewable for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of the Advisor and our independent directors. 

The following table represents the fees incurred associated with the services provided by our Advisor for the periods indicated:

Operating activities 

The
cash provided by operating activities of 3.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of our net loss of 3.5
million which was offset by the changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1.9 million, depreciation and amortization, loss from
investments in unconsolidated affiliated real estate entities and other non-cash items aggregating 4.7 million. 

Investing activities 

The
cash provided by investing activities of 2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of net proceeds from
the sale of marketable securities of 1.8 million and distributions from the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture of 0.9 million offset by
capital contributions of 0.2 million made to the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture and purchases of investment property of 0.3
million. 

Financing activities 

The
cash used in financing activities of 2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of debt principal payments
of 31.1 million, loan fees and expenses of 0.5 million, distributions to common stockholders of 1.0 million and redemptions of Common
Shares of 0.7 million partially offset by proceeds from mortgage financing of 30.8 million. 

Distributions on Common Shares 

On November 13, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized and we declared a Common Share distribution of 0.075 per share for the quarterly period ending December 31, 2023. The distribution is the pro rata equivalent of an annual distribution of 0.30 per share, or an annualized rate of 3 based on a share price of 10.00. The distribution of 1.0 million was paid on January 15, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2023. 

On March 18, 2024, the Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly distributions. 

Future distributions declared, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. The Board of Directors will consider various factors in its determination, including but not limited to, the sources and availability of capital, revenues and other sources of income, operating and interest expenses and our ability to refinance near-term debt as well as the IRS s annual distribution requirement that REITs distribute no less than 90 of their taxable income. We cannot assure that any future distributions will be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have previously established or may establish. 

Subordinated Participation Interests 

In connection with our Offering, the Special Limited Partner purchased 242 Subordinated Participation Interests in the Operating Partnership at a cost of 50,000 per unit, with an aggregate value of 12.1 million. 

These Subordinated Participation Interests may entitle the Special limited Partner to a portion of any regular distributions that we make to our stockholders, but only after our stockholders have received a stated preferred return. However, from our inception through September 30, 2024, there have been no distributions declared on the Subordinated Participation Interests. Any future distributions on the Subordinated Participation Interests will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a stated preferred return. 

The Subordinated Participation Interests may also entitle the Special Limited Partner to a portion of any liquidating distributions made by the Operating Partnership. The value of such distributions will depend upon the net proceeds available for distribution upon our liquidation and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time. Liquidating distributions to the Special Limited Partner will always be subordinated until stockholders receive a distribution equal to their initial investment plus a stated preferred return. 

31 

SRP 

Our share repurchase program (the SRP may provide eligible stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell Common Shares back to us, subject to restrictions and applicable law. 

On March 19, 2020, the Board of Directors amended the SRP to remove stockholder notice requirements and also approved the suspension of all redemptions. 

Effective May 10, 2021, the Board of Directors partially reopened the SRP to allow, subject to various conditions as set forth below, for redemptions submitted in connection with a stockholder s death and hardship, respectively, and set the price for all such purchases to our current estimated NAV per Share, as determined by our board of directors and reported by us from time to time. Deaths that occurred subsequent to January 1, 2020 were eligible for consideration, subject to certain conditions. Beginning January 1, 2022, requests for redemptions in connection with a stockholder s death must be submitted and received by us within one year of the stockholder s date of death for consideration. 

On
the above noted date, the Board of Directors established that on an annual basis, we would not redeem in excess of 0.5 of the number
of shares outstanding as of the end of the preceding year for either death or hardship redemptions, respectively. Additionally, redemption
requests generally would be processed on a quarterly basis and would be subject to proration if either type of redemption requests exceeded
the annual limitation. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we repurchased 66,791 Common Shares at a weighted average price of 9.94. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased
107,371 Common Shares at a weighted average price of 10.08. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

On July 31, 2024, we entered into a
loan agreement with a financial institution providing for a non-recourse revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility of up to 40.0 million. We received an initial advance of 30.8 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and designated six of our
hotel properties as collateral. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR plus 3.30 , subject to a 6.64 floor, with an initial
scheduled maturity of July 31, 2027, subject to two, one-year extension options at the sole discretion of the lender, and provides for
monthly interest-only payments with the unpaid principal balance due at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings
up to 65 of the loan-to-value ratio of properties designated as collateral and also requires the maintenance of certain covenants, including
prescribed minimum debt service coverage and debt yield ratios, which if not met may also be achieved through principal paydowns on the
outstanding balance. 

We used the initial advance from the
Revolving Credit Facility to repay in full the outstanding principal balance of 30.8 million under our nonrecourse revolving loan up
to 60 million (the Revolving Loan with the same financial institution, which was also secured by the same six hotel properties.
The scheduled maturity of the Revolving Loan had previously been extended from July 13, 2024 until July 31, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was 30.8 million, no additional borrowings were available and its interest rate was
8.26 . 

On December 1, 2023, we entered into
an interest rate cap contract at a cost of 44 with an unrelated financial institution in order to reduce the effect of increases to the
interest rate associated with the Revolving Loan. The interest rate cap contract had a notional amount of 30.8 million, matured on July 13, 2024 and effectively capped AMERIBOR at 5.34 . 

In connection with the Revolving Credit
Facility, we simultaneously entered into an interest rate cap contract at a cost of 85 with an unrelated financial institution in order
to reduce the effect of increases to the interest rate associated with the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate cap contract has
a notional amount of 30.8 million, matures on July 31, 2025 and effectively caps SOFR at 5.34 .

mortgage payable obligations based on the interest rate specified in the associated debt agreement. All of our mortgage debt outstanding
as of September 30, 2024 bears interest based on one-month AMERIBOR plus a specified spread, subject to a floor. For purposes of calculating
future interest amounts on our variable interest rate debt, the one-month SOFR and the one-month AMERIBOR rates as of September 30, 2024
were used. 

Certain
of our debt agreements also contain clauses providing for prepayment penalties. As of September 30, 2024 we were in compliance with all
of our financial debt covenants. 

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliated Entities 

Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture 

On March 27, 2018, we and Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, Inc. Lightstone REIT II ), a related party REIT also sponsored by the Sponsor, acquired, through the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture, the Hilton Garden Inn - Long Island City from an unrelated third party, for aggregate consideration of 60.0 million, which consisted of 25.0 million of cash and 35.0 million of proceeds from a five-year term non-recourse loan from a financial institution (the Hilton Garden Inn Mortgage ), excluding closing and other related transaction costs. We paid 12.9 million for a 50 membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. 

On May 31, 2023, the Hilton Garden Inn Mortgage was further amended to provide for (i) an extension of the maturity date for an additional five years, (ii) the interest rate to be adjusted to SOFR plus 3.25 , subject to a 6.41 floor, (iii) interest-only payments for the first two years of its extended term with principal and interest payments pursuant to a 300-month amortization schedule thereafter and the remaining unpaid balance due in full at its maturity date of May 31, 2028, (iv) the ability to draw up to an additional 3.0 million of principal, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and (v) certain changes to its financial covenants. Additionally, the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture is required to fund an aggregate of 1.3 million, through monthly payments of 37 from May 31, 2023 through June 1, 2026, into a cash collateral reserve account which may be drawn upon for specified capital expenditures. 

33 

We and Lightstone REIT II each have a 50 co-managing membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. We account for our membership interest in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method of accounting because we exert significant influence over but do not control the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. All capital contributions and distributions of earnings from the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to each member s equity interest percentage. Any distributions in excess of earnings from the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture are made to the members pursuant to the terms of the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture s operating agreement. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we received distributions from the Hilton Garden Joint Venture of 0.9 million and made contributions of 0.1 million to the
Hilton Garden Joint Venture. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received distributions from the Hilton Garden Joint Venture
of 0.1 million and made contributions of 0.4 million to the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture was in compliance with all of its financial debt covenants. 

Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture 

On August 5, 2021, we formed a joint venture with Lightstone Value Plus REIT IV, Inc. Lightstone REIT IV ), a related party REIT also sponsored by the Sponsor, pursuant to which we acquired 25 of Lightstone REIT IV s membership interest in the Bedford Avenue Holdings LLC, which effective on that date became the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture, for aggregate consideration of 7.9 million. In July 2019, Lightstone REIT IV, through its then wholly owned subsidiary, Bedford Avenue Holdings LLC, previously acquired four adjacent parcels of land located at 353-361 Bedford Avenue in the Williamsburg neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, from unrelated third parties, for the development of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel. 

As a result, we and Lightstone REIT IV have 25 and 75 membership interests, respectively, in the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture. We have determined that the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture is a variable interest entity and we are not the primary beneficiary, as it was determined that Lightstone REIT IV is the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we account for our membership interest in the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture in accordance with the equity method because we exert significant influence over but do not control the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture. All capital contributions and distributions of earnings from the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture are made on a pro rata basis in proportion to each member s equity interest percentage. Any distributions in excess of earnings from the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture are made to the members pursuant to the terms of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture s operating agreement. 

On August 5, 2021, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture entered into a development agreement (the Development Agreement with an affiliate of the Sponsor (the Williamsburg Moxy Developer pursuant to which the Williamsburg Moxy Developer was paid a development fee equal to 3 of hard and soft costs, as defined in the Development Agreement, incurred in connection with the development and construction of the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel. Additionally on August 5, 2021, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture obtained construction financing for the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel as discussed below. Furthermore, certain affiliates of the Sponsor are reimbursed for various development and development-related costs attributable to the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel. 

The
Williamsburg Moxy Hotel was substantially completed and opened for business on March 7, 2023. In connection with the opening of
the hotel, including its food and beverage venues, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture incurred pre-opening costs of 0.1 million
and 2.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Pre-opening costs generally consist
of non-recurring personnel, marketing and other costs. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made capital contributions to the Williamsburg Moxy Joint Venture of 0.1 million
and 0.8 million, respectively. 

34 

Moxy Construction Loan 

On August 5, 2021, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture entered into a recourse construction loan facility with a financial institution for up to 77.0 million (the Moxy Construction Loan to fund certain of the development, construction and certain pre-opening costs associated with the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel. The Moxy Construction Loan, which was scheduled to initially mature on February 5, 2024, was further extended to May 4, 2024. The Moxy Construction Loan was collateralized by the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel. The Moxy Construction Loan provided for a replacement benchmark rate in connection with the phase-out of LIBOR and effective after June 30, 2023, the Moxy Construction Loan s interest rate converted from LIBOR plus 9.00 , with a floor of 9.50 , to SOFR plus 9.11 , with a floor of 9.61 . The Moxy Construction Loan required monthly interest-only payments based on a rate of 7.50 and the excess was added to the outstanding loan balance due at maturity. SOFR as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 4.96 and 5.35 , respectively. 

As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Construction Loan was 83.8 million (including 6.9 million of excess interest added to principal), net of deferred financing fees of 0.1 million. 

In
connection with the Moxy Construction Loan, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture paid 3.7 million of loan fees and expenses and
accrued 0.8 million of loan exit fees. 

Moxy Mortgage Loans 

On April 19, 2024, the Williamsburg
Moxy Joint Venture entered into an 86.0 million senior mortgage loan facility (the Moxy Senior Loan and a 9.0 million
junior mortgage loan facility (the Moxy Junior Loan and together with the Moxy Senior Loan, the Moxy Mortgage Loans with unrelated third parties. 

The Moxy Mortgage Loans bear interest
at SOFR plus 5.10 , subject to an 8.75 floor (10.06 as of September 30, 2024). The Moxy Mortgage Loans initially mature on
April 19, 2027, but may be further extended though the exercise of two six-month extension options, subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions. The Moxy Mortgage Loans require monthly interest-only payments with their outstanding principal due in full at
maturity and are collateralized by the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel, however, the Moxy Junior Loan is subordinate
to the Moxy Senior Loan. The Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture used 85.8 million of the aggregate proceeds from the Moxy
Mortgage Loans in connection with the payoff of the Moxy Construction Loan consisting of the outstanding indebtedness (principal
and interest) of 86.0 million and accrued exit fees of 0.8 million, net of restricted escrows of 1.0 million. 

As of September 30, 2024, the
outstanding principal balance of the Moxy Mortgage Loans was 95.0 million and the remaining unamortized deferred financing fees were
 2.9 million. 

In
connection with the Moxy Mortgage Loans, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture has provided certain interest and carry costs guarantees.
Furthermore, in connection with the Moxy Mortgage Loans, 3.2 million of the initial proceeds advanced at closing were used to fund reserves
for interest, real estate taxes and insurance. Additionally, in connection with the Moxy Mortgage Loans, the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel
Joint Venture paid an aggregate of 2.8 million of loan fees and expenses and accrued 0.5 million of loan exit fees which were included
in other liabilities on the condensed balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. 

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. 

35 

Because of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations FFO ), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 

We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s definition. 

We believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 

Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings. 

Because of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA ), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations MFFO ), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 

We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses (which includes costs incurred in connection with strategic alternatives), amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of market lease and other intangibles, net (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments and borrowings, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (including gains or losses incurred on assets held for sale), gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. Certain of the above adjustments are also made to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, such as for the amortization of a premium and accretion of a discount on debt and securities investments, amortization of fees, any unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives, securities or other investments, as well as other adjustments. 

36 

MFFO excludes non-recurring impairment of real estate-related investments. We assess the credit quality of our investments and adequacy of reserves on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Significant judgment is required in this analysis. We consider the estimated net recoverable value of a loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the prospects for the borrower and the competitive situation of the region where the borrower does business. 

We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. 

Not all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 

Neither the SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to the White Paper or the Practice Guidelines or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry, and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.

(1) 
 Management believes that adjusting for gains or losses related to extinguishment/sale of debt, derivatives or securities holdings is appropriate because they are items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations. By excluding these items, management believes that MFFO provides supplemental information related to sustainable operations that will be more comparable between other reporting periods. 
 
 (2) 
 Management believes that adjusting for mark-to-market adjustments is appropriate because they are nonrecurring items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations and reflects unrealized impacts on value based only on then current market conditions, although they may be based upon current operational issues related to an individual property or industry or general market conditions. Mark-to-market adjustments are made for items such as ineffective derivative instruments, certain marketable securities and any other items that GAAP requires we make a mark-to-market adjustment for. The need to reflect mark-to-market adjustments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly and/or annual basis in accordance with GAAP.
