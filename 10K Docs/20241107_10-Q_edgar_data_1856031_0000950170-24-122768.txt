 For example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as our future financial performance, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flows or to raise additional capital when necessary or desirable, our success in attracting, hiring, motivating and retaining our senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel, our ability to declare and pay dividends on our Class A common stock and other topics relating to our business, operations and financial performance such as: 
 the supply and demand of live concert, sporting and theater events; 

the impact of adverse economic conditions affecting discretionary consumer and corporate spending; 

our ability to maintain and develop our relationships with ticket buyers, sellers and partners;

our ability to comply with applicable regulatory regimes; 

the impact of unfavorable legislative outcomes, or unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings; and 

our ability to maintain the integrity of our information systems and infrastructure, and to identify, assess and manage relevant cybersecurity risks. 

We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information.

Therefore, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Report or, in the case of statements incorporated by reference herein, as of the date of the incorporated document. 
 Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of this Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on March 8, 2024 (our 2023 Form 10-K ), as well as in our press releases and other filings with the SEC.

Warrant 

The fair value of the Note is determined using the income approach, utilizing Level 3 inputs. The estimated fair value of the Warrant is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation related to the expected term, the expected volatility, the risk-free rate of interest, and the expected dividend yield. Because of the inherent uncertainty of this valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.

Accrued customer credits represent credits issued and outstanding for cancellations or other service issues related to recorded sales transactions. The accrued amount is reduced by the amount of credits estimated to go unused, or breakage, provided that the credits are not subject to escheatment. We estimate breakage based on historical usage trends and available data on comparable programs, and we recognize breakage in proportion to the pattern of redemption for customer credits. Our breakage estimates could be impacted by future activity differing from our estimates, the effects of which could be material. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , million and million of accrued customer credits were redeemed, respectively, and we recognized million and million of revenue from breakage, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , million and million of accrued customer credits were redeemed, respectively, and we recognized million and million of revenue from breakage, respectively. Breakage amounts are net of reductions in associated accounts receivable balances. Accrued future customer compensation represents an estimate of the amount of customer compensation due from cancellation charges in the future. These provisions, which are based on historic experience, revenue volumes for future events and our estimate of the likelihood of future cancellations, are recognized as a component of Revenues in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The expected recoveries of these obligations from ticket sellers and partners are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. This estimated accrual could be impacted by future activity differing from our estimates, the effects of which could be material. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net increase in revenue of million and million, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a net increase in revenue of million and million, respectively, in each case from the reversals of previously recorded revenue and changes to accrued future customer compensation related to event cancellations where the performance obligations were satisfied in prior periods.

million was recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to expected claim submissions and credit redemptions as of the measurement date. We have been a defendant in multiple class action lawsuits related to customer compensation for cancellations, primarily as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. A final order approving the settlement of one such lawsuit was entered by the court in November 2021 , pursuant to which we paid million (after insurance) to fund a claims settlement pool in 2021 that was fully disbursed in 2022. A final order approving the settlement of another such lawsuit was entered by the court on January 31, 2023, pursuant to which we paid million (after insurance) to cover legal and administrative fees and approved claims (payments for which were made in August 2023). We had accrued liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 related to these matters. We are a defendant in a lawsuit related to an alleged violation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. An order preliminarily approving the settlement of this lawsuit was entered by the court on September 27, 2024, which remains subject to final court approval and which will be covered in full by insurance. As of September 30, 2024 , a liability of million was recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets related to this matter. We had accrued liability as of December 31, 2023 related to this matter. Indirect Taxes In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., which overturned previous case law that had precluded state and local governments from imposing sales tax collection requirements on retailers without a physical presence. In response, most jurisdictions have adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies, and we have registered and begun collecting tax where required by statute. It is reasonably possible that state or local governments will continue to adopt or interpret laws such that we are required to calculate, collect and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions. A successful assertion by one or more jurisdictions could result in material tax liabilities, including uncollected taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest. Based on our analysis of certain state and local regulations, specifically related to marketplace facilitators and ticket sales, we have recorded liabilities in all jurisdictions where we believe a risk of loss is probable. We

 million and million income tax expense in continuing operations, respectively. Our effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to a redeemable noncontrolling interests adjustment for VSI s allocable share of Hoya Intermediate s income, state taxes, equity-based compensation and limitations on compensation deductions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a million income tax expense and a million income tax benefit in continuing operations, respectively. Our effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the release of our valuation allowance on our U.S. net operating losses, interest limitations and tax credit carryforwards. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our deferred tax assets were primarily the result of our investment in partnership, the TRA, net operating losses, interest limitations and tax credit carryforwards. As of each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. Certain tax attributes remain subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as a result of the historical acquisitions. We maintain a partial valuation allowance on our investments in partnership related to the portion of the basis difference that we do not expect to realize on a more likely than not basis. Tax Receivable Agreement In connection with the Merger Transaction, we entered into the TRA with the existing Hoya Intermediate unitholders that provides for our payment to such unitholders of of the amount of the tax savings, if any, that we realize (or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize) as a result of, or attributable to, (i) increases in the tax basis of assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate or its subsidiaries from, among other things, any redemptions or exchanges of Intermediate Units, (ii) existing tax basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions arising from such tax basis) in long-lived assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate and its subsidiaries and (iii) certain other tax benefits (including deductions in respect of imputed interest) related to us making payments under the TRA. Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon the generation of future taxable income over the term of the TRA and future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related payments. As of September 30, 2024 , we estimate that the tax savings associated with all tax attributes described above would require us to pay million, primarily over the next years. As of September 30, 2024, million is expected to be due within the next months.

Hoya Topco s weighted average allocation of Hoya Intermediate's net income 

Net income attributable to Hoya Topco's redeemable noncontrolling interests 

Net income attributable to Class A common stockholders basic is calculated by subtracting the portion of Hoya Intermediate s net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests from our total net income, which includes our net income for activities outside of our investment in Hoya Intermediate, including income tax expense (benefit) for VSI s portion of income, as well as the full results of Hoya Intermediate on a consolidated basis. Net income per Class A common stock diluted is based on the average number of shares of our Class A common stock used for the basic earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the weighted average number of Class A common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock and if-converted methods, as applicable. Net income attributable to Class A common stockholders diluted is adjusted for (i) our share of Hoya Intermediate s consolidated net income after giving effect to Intermediate Units that convert into potential shares of our Class A common stock, to the extent it is dilutive, and (ii) the impact of changes in the fair value of the Intermediate Warrants, to the extent they are dilutive.

See the Key Business Metrics section below for more information on Marketplace GOV and Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ). 
 Our Business Model 
 We operate our business in two segments, Marketplace and Resale. 
 Marketplace 
 In our Marketplace segment, we primarily act as an intermediary between ticket buyers, sellers and partners through which we earn revenue processing ticket sales for live events and attractions and from facilitating the booking of hotel rooms and packages from our Owned Properties and from our Private Label offering. Our Owned Properties consist of our websites and mobile applications, including Vivid Seats, Vegas.com (as defined herein) and Wavedash (as defined herein), and our Private Label offering consists of numerous distribution partners. The Owned Properties component of our Marketplace segment also includes our Vivid Picks daily fantasy sports offering, where users partake in contests by making picks from a variety of sport and player matchups. Using our online platform, we facilitate customer payments, deposits and withdrawals, coordinate ticket deliveries and provide customer service. We do not hold ticket inventory in our Marketplace segment. 
 We primarily earn revenue from service and delivery fees charged to ticket buyers. We also earn referral fee revenue by offering event ticket insurance to ticket buyers using a third-party insurance provider. The revenue we earn from our Vivid Picks daily fantasy sports offering is the difference between cash entry fees collected and cash amounts paid out to users for winning picks, less customer promotions and incentives. 
 We incur costs for developing and maintaining our platform, providing back-office support and customer service, facilitating payments and deposits, and shipping non-electronic tickets. We also incur substantial marketing costs, primarily related to online advertising. 
 29 

A key component of our platform is Skybox, a proprietary enterprise resource planning ERP tool used by the majority of ticket sellers. Skybox is a free-to-use system that helps ticket sellers manage ticket inventories, adjust pricing and fulfill orders across multiple ticket resale marketplaces. Professional ticket sellers use an ERP to manage their operations, and Skybox is their most widely adopted ERP. 
 Resale 
 In our Resale segment, we primarily acquire tickets to resell on secondary ticketing marketplaces, including our own. Our Resale segment also provides internal research and development support for Skybox and our ongoing efforts to deliver industry-leading seller software and tools. 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We use the following metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team.

(1) Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes and net of cancellations that occurred during that period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Marketplace GOV was negatively impacted by cancellations in the amount of 35.4 million and 74.9 million, respectively, compared to 10.1 million and 33.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

(2) Total Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, net of cancellations that occurred during that period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Marketplace segment experienced 77,012 and 179,453 cancellations, respectively, compared to 28,203 and 78,034 cancellations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

(3) Total Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders in a period, net of cancellations that occurred during that period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Resale segment experienced 2,411 and 4,494 cancellations, respectively, compared to 851 and 2,363 cancellations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

(4) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for making period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. See the Adjusted EBITDA section below for more information and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable US GAAP measure. 

Marketplace GOV 
 Marketplace GOV is a key driver of our Marketplace segment revenue. Marketplace GOV represents the total transactional amount of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, inclusive of fees, exclusive of taxes and net of cancellations that occurred during that period. Marketplace GOV reflects our ability to attract and retain customers, as well as the overall health of the industry.

Marketplace GOV can be impacted by seasonality. Quarterly fluctuations in Marketplace GOV can result from changes in event supply, the popularity and demand of performers, tours, teams and events, the mix of concert venue types among stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters, the length and team composition of sports playoff series and championship games, and the number of cancellations. 
 Marketplace GOV decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in average order size for concert events, including due to a shift in venue mix away from stadiums, and an increase in cancellations. Conversely, Marketplace GOV increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in Total Marketplace orders. 
 Total Marketplace Orders 
 Total Marketplace orders represents the volume of Marketplace segment orders placed on our platform in a period, net of cancellations that occurred during that period. An order can include one or more tickets, hotel rooms or parking passes. Total Marketplace orders allows us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Marketplace segment. Total Marketplace orders decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in cancellations, partially offset by revenues from Vegas.com and Wavedash. Conversely, Total Marketplace orders increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of orders processed, which was due in part to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 including orders processed through Vegas.com and Wavedash. 
 Total Resale Orders 
 Total Resale orders represents the volume of Resale segment orders in a period, net of cancellations that occurred during that period. An order can include one or more tickets or parking passes. Total Resale orders allows us to monitor order volume and better identify trends within our Resale segment. Total Resale orders increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of higher activity in our Resale segment. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a measure frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe this measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes the impact of items that are outside of our control or not reflective of ongoing performance related directly to the operation of our business. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management team internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance, and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. Moreover, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for making period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and highlighting trends in our operating results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with US GAAP and may exclude recurring costs, such as interest expense net, equity-based compensation, litigation, settlements and related costs, change in fair value of warrants, change in fair value of derivative assets and foreign currency revaluation losses (gains). In addition, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the US GAAP amounts excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

Total revenues decreased 1.5 million, or 1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease, which occurred only in our Marketplace segment, resulted primarily from a decrease in average order size and an increase in cancellations, partially offset by revenue from Vegas.com and Wavedash. Total revenues increased 61.2 million, or 12 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase, which occurred in both our Marketplace and Resale segments, resulted primarily from an increase in orders processed, which was due in part to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 including orders processed through Vegas.com and Wavedash.

Marketplace revenues decreased 1.7 million, or 1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in average order size for concert events, including due to a shift in venue mix away from stadiums, and an increase in cancellations. Marketplace revenues increased 52.6 million, or 12 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in Total Marketplace orders. 
 Total Marketplace orders decreased 0.1 million, or 2 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in cancellations, partially offset by orders from Vegas.com and Wavedash. Total marketplace orders increased 1.0 million, or 13 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the number of orders processed, particularly for theater events, which was due in part to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 including orders processed through Vegas.com and Wavedash. 
 Cancellation charges, which are classified as a reduction to revenues, represented a 7.3 million reduction to revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 1.0 million increase to revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 20.4 million reduction to revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 7.6 million reduction to revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cancellation charges was primarily due to a higher number of event cancellations, including certain large concert tour cancellations, and lower revenue recognized from customer credit breakage.

The increase in Owned Properties revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from an increase in the number of orders processed, which was due in part to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 including orders processed through Vegas.com and Wavedash. 
 The decrease in Private Label revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from the negative impact to revenue of decreased customer credit breakage. 
 In our Marketplace segment, we also earn referral fee revenue by offering event ticket insurance to ticket buyers using a third-party insurance provider. Our referral fee revenue was 6.0 million and 19.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 7.3 million and 21.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in the insurance attachment rate to orders. 
 Resale 
 Resale revenues increased 0.2 million, or 1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 8.6 million, or 10 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in Total Resale orders. 
 Total Resale orders increased less than 0.1 million, or 5 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased less than 0.1 million, or 16 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from higher order volume. 
 Cancellation charges, which are classified as a reduction to revenues, negatively impacted Resale revenues by 0.3 million and 1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.3 million and 1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

Marketing and selling expenses, which are entirely attributable to our Marketplace segment, decreased 9.2 million, or 12 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in offline advertising. Marketing and selling expenses increased 8.7 million, or 4 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily resulted from higher spending on online advertising, which increased by 15.1 million, or 9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in online advertising spending was primarily driven by an increase in performance marketing channel spend. The changes in Marketing and selling expenses were relatively consistent with the changes in Marketplace GOV, which decreased by 13 and increased by 3 during the same respective periods.

Total general and administrative expenses increased 9.1 million, or 24 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 41.8 million, or 39 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel expenses from higher equity-based compensation expense and higher employee headcount, including headcount added through our acquisitions of Vegas.com and Wavedash. The June 2024 repurchase and cancellation by Hoya Topco (using its own funds) of all of its outstanding profits interests and phantom units held by our employees also contributed to higher equity-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (for more information, see Note 18, Equity-Based Compensation , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). Non-income tax expense increased as a result of accruing for sales and indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we believe it is probable we should remit but have not yet collected from customers. The increase in other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months 
 36 

ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by higher computer, telecom and office expenses and higher professional service fees, including expenses and fees incurred by Vegas.com and Wavedash. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 7.4 million, or 223 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 23.1 million, or 268 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the intangibles acquired as part of our acquisitions of Vegas.com and Wavedash and, to a lesser extent, an increase in capitalized development activities related to our platform. 
 Other Expense (Income) 
 Interest Expense Net 
 Interest expense net increased 3.8 million, or 148 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 8.1 million, or 94 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a higher amount of outstanding principal debt and lower interest income earned on cash balances. 
 Other Income 
 Other income increased 8.0 million, or 769 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 2.9 million, or 787 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the fair value remeasurement of warrants and foreign currency revaluation gains. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Income tax expense increased 1.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased 28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the June 30, 2023 release of our previously recorded valuation allowance on our U.S. tax attributes carryforward deferred tax assets, which produced a sizable income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations. Our primary short-term requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund general working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements. Our primary long-term liquidity needs are related to debt repayment and potential acquisitions. 
 Our primary source of funds is cash generated from operations. Our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 202.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, which consist of interest-bearing deposit accounts, money market accounts managed by financial institutions and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated positive cash flows from our operating activities. 
 Loan Agreements 
 In June 2017, we entered into a 575.0 million first lien debt facility (the June 2017 First Lien Loan ). We had an outstanding loan balance of 465.7 million under the June 2017 First Lien Loan as of December 31, 2021. In February 2022, we repaid 190.7 million of the outstanding June 2017 First Lien Loan. In February 2022, we also entered into an amendment which refinanced the remaining balance of the June 2017 First Lien Loan with a 275.0 million term loan (the February 2022 First Lien Loan ), added a 100.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility with a maturity date of February 3, 2027, replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR )-based floating interest rate with a term SOFR-based floating interest rate, and revised the springing financial covenant to require compliance with a first lien net leverage ratio when revolver borrowings exceed certain levels. 
 
 37 

On June 14, 2024, we entered into an amendment which refinanced the remaining balance of the February 2022 First Lien Loan with a 395.0 million term loan (the June 2024 First Lien Loan with a maturity date of February 3, 2029 and revised the term SOFR-based floating interest rate. The June 2024 First Lien Loan requires quarterly amortization payments of 1.0 million. The Revolving Facility, which was unaffected by the refinancing of the February 2022 First Lien Loan, does not require periodic payments. All obligations under the June 2024 First Lien Loan are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by first-priority perfected security interests in substantially all of our and the applicable guarantors assets. The June 2024 First Lien Loan carries an interest rate of SOFR (subject to a 0.5 floor) plus a margin of 3.00 ; provided that such margin may be reduced to 2.75 if the corporate rating assigned to us by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and S P Global Ratings is at least Ba3/BB- (in each case, stable or better). 
 In connection with our acquisition of Wavedash, we assumed long-term debt owed to Shoko Chukin Bank (the Shoko Chukin Bank Loan of JPY 458.3 million (approximately 3.1 million), which had an original maturity date of June 24, 2026 and was subject to a fixed interest rate of 1.27 per annum. On April 4, 2024, we paid off the Shoko Chukin Bank Loan balance in its entirety. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had the June 2024 First Lien Loan outstanding and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility. 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 On February 29, 2024, our Board of Directors (our Board authorized a share repurchase program for up to 100.0 million of our Class A common stock, which program was publicly announced on March 5, 2024 and does not have a fixed expiration date (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program ). As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares of our Class A common stock for approximately 22.8 million under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, for which we had recorded approximately 0.3 million in commissions and excise taxes. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 77.2 million remained available for future repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program. 
 In May 2022, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for up to 40.0 million of our Class A common stock, which program was publicly announced on May 26, 2022 (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program ). The 2022 Share Repurchase Program s authorization was fully utilized during 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2023. Cumulatively, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for approximately 40.0 million under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, for which we recorded approximately 0.1 million in commissions and excise taxes. 
 Share repurchases are accounted for as Treasury stock in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Distributions to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
 Per its Limited Liability Company Agreement, Hoya Intermediate is required to make pro-rata tax distributions to its members, of which 2.8 million and 9.3 million was distributed to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Tax Receivable Agreement 
 In connection with the Merger Transaction, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA with the existing Hoya Intermediate unitholders that provides for our payment to such unitholders of 85 of the amount of the tax savings, if any, that we realize (or, under certain circumstances, are deemed to realize) as a result of, or attributable to, (i) increases in the tax basis of assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate or its subsidiaries from, among other things, any redemptions or exchanges of Intermediate Units, (ii) existing tax basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions arising from such tax basis) in long-lived assets owned directly or indirectly by Hoya Intermediate and its subsidiaries and (iii) certain other tax benefits (including deductions in respect of imputed interest) related to us making payments under the TRA. 

38 

Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon the generation of future taxable income over the term of the TRA and future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related payments. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that the tax savings associated with all tax attributes described above would require us to pay 165.7 million, primarily over the next 15 years. As of September 30, 2024, 3.5 million is expected to be due within the next 12 months.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to 18.7 million in net income, net non-cash charges of 70.2 million and net cash outflows from a 82.8 million change in net operating assets. The net cash outflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to decreases in Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The decrease in Accounts payable was due to a decrease in amounts payable to ticket sellers as a result of lower Marketplace GOV. The decrease in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities was also due to lower Marketplace GOV, as well as the timing of disbursements. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 114.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to 84.6 million in net income, net non-cash charges of 6.1 million and net cash inflows from a 23.6 million change in net operating assets. The net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets were primarily due to an increase in amounts payable to ticket sellers as a result of higher order volumes. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily related to capital spending on development activities related to our platform. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 71.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily related to the acquisition of Wavedash and capital spending on development activities related to our platform. 
 Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 87.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily related to the refinancing of the February 2022 First Lien Loan with the June 2024 First Lien Loan on June 14, 2024. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily related to the 2022 Share Repurchase Program and tax distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The estimates and assumptions associated with revenue recognition, equity-based compensation, warrants and earnouts, recoverability of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, definite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and valuation allowances have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these are the policies that are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our condensed consolidated financial statements. See our 2023 Form 10-K for a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates. There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, New Accounting Standards , to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our primary market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt. We manage our exposure to this risk through established policies and procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our market risk is affected by changes in interest rates. The June 2024 First Lien Loan (our only outstanding debt) bears a floating interest rate based on market rates plus an applicable spread. We will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from our floating-rate debt, which may adversely impact our financial results. A hypothetical 1 change in interest rates, assuming rates are above our interest rate floor, would have impacted our interest expense by 1.0 million and 2.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, based on amounts outstanding under the June 2024 First Lien Loan. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, while certain of our international subsidiaries functional currency is their local currency. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we are subject to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. 
 We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars during consolidation. We have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant. 
 Due to fluctuations in exchange rates resulting from the current macroeconomic environment, we may experience negative impacts on the translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars, as well as the revaluation adjustments on U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loans. Our foreign currency translation adjustment included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income resulted in a gain of 2.9 million and a loss of 0.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would have impacted our foreign currency revaluation loss (gain), which is reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, by 3.6 million.

Item 4. Cont rols and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Material Weakness 
 In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the implementation of segregation of duties as part of our control activities, the establishment of clearly defined roles within our finance and accounting functions and the number of personnel in those functions with an appropriate level of technical accounting and SEC reporting experience which, in the aggregate, constitute a material weakness. 
 Remediation Activities 
 We continue to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and are committed to ensuring that such controls are designed and operating effectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to review our internal control procedures, to implement new controls and processes, to hire additional qualified personnel and to establish more robust processes to support our internal control over financial reporting, including by creating clearly defined roles and responsibilities and the appropriate segregation of duties. These actions are continuing to be validated through testing and, when fully implemented, we believe they will be effective in remediating the material weakness. However, additional time is required to complete implementing the enhanced procedures and to test and ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the improved controls. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls have been in place and operating for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. We continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except with respect to the continuing remediation activities described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to review the internal control structures of Wavedash and Vegas.com and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as we continue to integrate such businesses into our overall internal control over financial reporting.
