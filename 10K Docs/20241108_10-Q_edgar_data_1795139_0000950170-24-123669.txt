The Retail Stores Milestone was fully achieved prior to expiration and settled in previous periods. On February 9, 2024, the Company and the former owners of Dharma agreed to amend the conditions of the Recreational Sales Milestone (the Amended Agreement ). Under the Amended Agreement, the former owners waived their right to the Recreational Sales Milestone in exchange for the delivery of Subordinate Voting Shares.

(c) Stock-Based Compensation The Company operates equity settled stock-based remuneration plans for its eligible directors, officers, employees and consultants. All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any stock-based payments are measured at their fair value unless the fair value cannot be estimated reliably. If the Company cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods and services received, the Company measures their value indirectly by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. For transactions with employees and others providing similar services, the Company measures the fair value of the services by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Equity settled stock-based payments under stock-based payment plans are ultimately recognized as an expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit to equity. In June 2018, the Company established the Green Thumb Industries Inc. 2018 Stock and Incentive Plan, which was amended by Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2 and Amendment No. 3 thereto (as amended, the Plan ). The maximum number of Restricted Stock Units RSUs and options outstanding under the Plan at any time shall not exceed of the Company's then issued and outstanding shares on an as-converted basis. The Company recognizes compensation expense for RSUs and options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of options expected to vest differs from the previous estimate. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognized in the current period with no adjustment to prior periods for expense previously recognized. Option and RSU awards generally vest over three years, and options typically have a life of five to ten years. Option grants under the Plan are determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors with the option price set at no less than 100 of the fair market value of a share on the date of grant.

Income Tax Expense 

Effective Tax Rate 

The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were based on the Company s forecasted annualized effective tax rates and were adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented. Due to its cannabis operations, the Company is subject to the limitations of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended IRC Section 280E under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E. Therefore, the effective tax rate can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income and provides for effective tax rates that are well in excess of statutory tax rates. Taxes paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were thousand and thousand, respectively.

 OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY 
 Established in 2014 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Green Thumb, a national cannabis consumer packaged goods company and retailer, promotes well-being through the power of cannabis while being committed to community and sustainable, profitable growth. As of September 30, 2024, Green Thumb has operations in fourteen U.S. markets, employs approximately 4,800 people and serves millions of patients and customers annually. 
 Green Thumb s core business is manufacturing, distributing and marketing a portfolio of cannabis consumer packaged goods brands (which we refer to as our Consumer Packaged Goods business), including Shine, Beboe, Dogwalkers, Doctor Solomon s, Good Green, incredibles and RYTHM. The Company distributes and markets these products primarily to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores across the United States as well as to Green Thumb-owned retail stores (which we refer to as our Retail business). 
 The Company s Consumer Packaged Goods portfolio is primarily generated from plant material that Green Thumb grows and processes itself, which we use to produce our consumer packaged goods in twenty manufacturing facilities. This portfolio consists of cannabis product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, capsules, tinctures, edibles, topicals, as well as other cannabis-related products across a range of stock keeping units ("SKUs") (none of which product categories are individually material to the Company). 
 Green Thumb owns and operates a national cannabis retail chain called RISE Dispensaries that provides relationship-centric retail experiences aimed to deliver a superior level of customer service through high-engagement consumer interaction, a consultative, transparent and education-forward selling approach and a consistently available assortment of cannabis products. In addition, Green Thumb owns Retail stores under other names, primarily where naming is subject to licensing or similar restrictions. The income from Green Thumb s Retail business is primarily derived from the sale of cannabis-related products, which includes the sale of Green Thumb produced products as well as those produced by third parties, with an immaterial (under 10 portion of this income resulting from the sale of other merchandise (such as t-shirts and accessories for cannabis use). The RISE Dispensaries currently are located in all fourteen of the states in which we operate. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 98 open and operating Retail locations. The Company s new store opening plans will remain fluid depending on market conditions, obtaining local licensing, construction and other permissions and subject to the Company s capital allocation plans.

 Revenues, net of Discounts 
 Revenues, net of discounts for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 286,865 thousand, up 4 from 275,398 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Key performance drivers for the period included the expansion of the adult-use market in New York and Maryland, legalization of adult-use sales in Ohio, which began on August 6, 2024, and revenue generated from new retail stores, partially offset by price compression and increased competition in certain markets. 
 The Company generated revenue from 98 Retail stores during the quarter compared to 85 in the same quarter of the prior year. Retail revenues made up 72 of total revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 75 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 139,274 thousand, down 2 from 141,592 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by operational leverage from the Company's Consumer Packaged Goods business and an increase in Retail sales of Green Thumb-produced products. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 147,591 thousand, representing a gross margin on the sale of branded cannabis flower and processed and packaged products including concentrates, edibles, topicals and other cannabis products, of 51 . This is compared to gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 133,806 thousand, or a 49 gross margin. The increase in gross profit (dollars) was directly attributable to the revenue increase as described above. The increase in gross margin (percent) was primarily driven by operational leverage from the Company's Consumer Packaged Goods business, as described above, and lower costs associated with the purchase of Retail inventory. 
 Total Expenses 
 Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 104,967 thousand, or 37 of revenues, net of discounts, an increase of 20,188 thousand compared to the same period in the prior year. Total expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 84,779 thousand or 31 of revenues, net of discounts. The increase in total expenses was attributable to increased costs associated with ongoing claims and litigation and increased costs associated with the opening and operation of new Retail stores as described above. 
 Total Other Income (Expense) 
 Total other income (expense) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (2,921) thousand, a favorable change of 773 thousand, primarily due to favorable fair value adjustments on the Company's warrant liability during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Revenues, net of discounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 842,818 thousand, an increase of 9 from 776,322 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was largely due to expansion of adult-use market in Maryland, growth in Consumer Packaged Goods revenues in New York and New Jersey, legalization of adult-use sales in Ohio, as well as revenue generated from new retail stores opened in the current period, partially offset by price compression and increased competition in certain markets. 
 
 The Company generated revenue from 98 retail stores during the period compared to 85 in the same period of the prior year.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the Retail segment were 206,124 thousand, an increase of 683 thousand, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Retail revenues, net of discounts, was primarily driven by the expansion of the adult-use market in New York and Maryland, legalization of adult-use sales in Ohio and revenue generated from new retail stores, primarily offset by price compression and increased competition in certain markets. 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the Consumer Packaged Goods segment were 165,500 thousand, an increase of 15,075 thousand or 10 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Consumer Packaged Goods revenues, net of discounts, was primarily driven by the increased production due to the completion of various construction projects in late 2023. 
 Intersegment eliminations associated with the Consumer Packaged Goods segment were (84,759) thousand, an increase of 4,291 thousand or 5 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in intersegment eliminations was driven by increased intercompany sales, primarily to Company-owned Retail stores in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. Consumer Packaged Goods revenues, net of intersegment eliminations, made up 28 of total revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Due to the vertically integrated nature of the business, the Company reviews its revenue at the Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods level while reviewing its operating results on a consolidated basis.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Revenues, net of discounts for the Retail segment were 614,558, an increase of 32,195 or 6 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Retail revenues, net of discounts, was primarily driven by the legalization of adult-use sales in Maryland, continued growth in existing markets, as well as revenue generated from new retail stores opened in the current period, partially offset by price compression and increased competition in certain markets. 
 
 Revenues, net of discounts, for the Consumer Packaged Goods segment were 471,735 thousand, an increase of 59,639 thousand or 14 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Consumer Packaged Goods revenues was primarily driven by the expansion of adult-use sales in Maryland, New York, New Jersey and Ohio, as described above, as well as increased production associated with the completion of various construction projects in 2023. 
 Intersegment eliminations associated with the Consumer Packaged Goods segment were 243,475 thousand, an increase of 25,338 thousand or 12 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in intersegment eliminations was driven by increased intercompany sales to Company-owned retail stores primarily in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York. Consumer Packaged Goods revenues, net of intersegment eliminations, made up 27 of total revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 25 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Due to the vertically integrated nature of the business, the Company reviews its revenue at the Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods level while reviewing its operating results on a consolidated basis. 
 Drivers of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 The Company derives its revenue from two revenue streams: a Consumer Packaged Goods business in which it manufactures, sells and distributes its portfolio of Consumer Packaged Goods brands including Shine, Beboe, Dogwalkers, Dr. Solomon s, Good Green, incredibles, and RYTHM, primarily to third-party customers; and a Retail business in which it sells finished goods sourced primarily from third-party cannabis manufacturers in addition to the Company s own Consumer Packaged Goods products direct to the end consumer in its Retail stores, as well as direct-to-consumer delivery where permitted by state law. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was contributed from Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods sales across California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is revenue less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold includes the costs directly attributable to product sales and includes amounts paid for finished goods, such as flower, edibles, and concentrates, as well as packaging and other supplies, fees for services and processing, and allocated overhead which includes allocations of rent, utilities and related costs. Cannabis costs are affected by various state regulations that limit the sourcing and procurement of cannabis product, which may create fluctuations in gross profit over comparative periods as the regulatory environment changes. Gross margin measures our gross profit as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to be focused on creating sustainable, profitable growth of the Company s business within its current markets while considering strategic acquisition and partnership opportunities. 
 Total Expenses 
 Total expenses other than the cost of goods sold consist of selling costs to support customer relationships and marketing and branding activities. It also includes a significant investment in the corporate infrastructure required to support the Company s ongoing business. 
 34 

Retail selling costs generally correlate to revenue. As new locations begin operations, these locations generally experience higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue compared to more established locations, which experience a more constant rate of selling costs. As a percentage of sales, the Company expects selling costs to remain constant in the more established locations and increase in the newer locations as business continues to grow. 
 General and administrative expenses also include costs incurred at the Company s corporate offices, primarily related to back office personnel costs, including salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, stock-based compensation and other professional service costs, and fair value adjustments on the Company's contingent consideration arrangements. The Company expects to continue to invest considerably in this area to support the business by attracting and retaining top-tier talent. Furthermore, the Company anticipates an increase in stock-based compensation expenses related to recruiting and hiring talent, along with legal and professional fees associated with being a publicly traded company in Canada and registered with the SEC. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The Company is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates and, consequently, income tax expense is a function of the allocation of taxable income by jurisdiction and the various activities that impact the timing of taxable events. As the Company operates in the federally illegal cannabis industry, it is subject to the limitations of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended IRC Section 280E, under which taxpayers are only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-allowable under IRC Section 280E and a higher effective tax rate than most industries. Therefore, the effective tax rate can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate to pre-tax income or loss. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and do not have standardized definitions under GAAP. The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items and believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the business. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented.

Liquidity, Financing Activities During the Period, and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 the Company had total current liabilities of 160,669 thousand and 126,050 thousand, respectively, and cash and cash equivalents of 173,641 thousand and 161,634 thousand, respectively, to meet its current obligations. The Company had working capital of 231,205 thousand as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 14,493 thousand as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in inventory. 
 The Company generates cash from its operations and deploys its capital reserves to acquire and develop assets capable of producing additional revenues and earnings over both the immediate and long term. Capital reserves are primarily being utilized for capital expenditures, facility improvements, strategic investment opportunities, product development and marketing, as well as customer, supplier, and investor and industry relations. 
 The Company takes a cautious approach in allocating its capital to maximize its returns while ensuring appropriate liquidity. Given the current uncertainty of the future economic environment, the Company has taken additional measures in monitoring and deploying its capital to minimize the negative impact on its current operations and expansion plans.

 Changes in or Adoption of Accounting Practices 
 Refer to the discussion of recently adopted/issued accounting pronouncements under Part I, Item 1, Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 Overview and Basis of Presentation. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

ITEM 3. QUANTITAVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk disclosures as set forth in Part II Item 7A of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company's management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Control Systems 
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be or have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
