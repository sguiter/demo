EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We operate our business through our reportable segments which include (1) the physical therapy operations segment and (2) the industrial injury prevention services IIP segment. Our physical
 therapy operations consist of physical therapy and occupational therapy clinics that provide pre- and post-operative care and treatment for a variety of orthopedic-related disorders, and sports-related injuries, and rehabilitation of injured
 workers. Services provided by the IIP segment include onsite services for clients employees including injury prevention and rehabilitation, performance optimization, post-offer employment testing, functional capacity evaluations and ergonomic
 assessments. The majority of these services are contracted with and paid for directly by employers, including a number of Fortune 500 companies. Other clients include large insurers and their contractors. These services are performed through
 Industrial Sports Medicine Professionals, consisting of both physical therapists and specialized certified athletic trainers.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed the acquisitions of clinic practices and IIP businesses detailed below:

Includes clinics added through acquisitions.

We also manage clinics owned by third parties through management contracts. In addition to the clinic count shown above, as of September 30, 2024, we managed 39
 clinics bringing the total owned/managed clinics to 700.

Our strategy is to continue acquiring outpatient physical therapy practices, develop outpatient physical therapy clinics as satellites in existing
 partnerships, and continue acquiring companies that provide or serve our IIP sector.

Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.44 per share payable on December 6, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 15, 2024. 

On October 31, 2024, we completed the acquisition of a 50 interest in MSO Metro, LLC Metro pursuant to the Equity Interest Purchase
 Agreement (the Purchase Agreement dated October 7, 2024 among U.S. Physical Therapy, Ltd. (a subsidiary of the Company), Metro, the members of Metro, and Michael G. Mayrsohn, as Sellers' Representative. We also became the managing member of
 Metro.

At the closing, we paid the purchase price of approximately 76.5 million, 75 million of which was funded by its cash on hand and the remaining 1.5 million through
 the issuance of 18,358 shares of our common stock based on a trailing five-day average as of the day immediately prior to closing. The shares of our common stock were issued in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to Section 4(2)
 under the Securities Act. The Purchase Agreement also includes an earnout where the sellers can earn up to another 20.0 million of consideration if certain performance criteria relating to the Metro business are achieved.

Regulatory Changes

The following is a discussion of some of the significant healthcare regulatory changes that have affected our financial performance in the periods covered by this report or are likely to affect our
 financial performance and financial condition in the future. The information below should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion of regulations contained in our 2023 Annual Report.

Medicare Reimbursement

The Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule MPFS ). Outpatient rehabilitation providers may enroll in Medicare as institutional
 outpatient rehabilitation facilities (i.e., rehab agencies) or individual physical or occupational therapists in private practice. The majority of our clinicians are enrolled as individual physical or occupational therapists in private practice
 while the remaining balance of providers are reimbursed through enrolled rehab agencies.

For calendar years 2021, 2022 and 2023, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS expected decreases in Medicare reimbursement were partially offset by one-time increases in payments as a
 result of other legislation passed by Congress, resulting in decreases of approximately 3.5 , 0.75 and 2.0 in each of these years, respectively. For January 1 through March 8 of 2024, CMS s final rule resulted in an approximate 3.5 decrease in
 Medicare payments for the therapy specialty. However, effective as of March 9, 2024, pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Congress minimized the reduction in Medicare payments for therapy services for the balance of 2024,
 resulting in an approximate 1.8 reduction in Medicare payments for therapy services (rather than the 3.5 decrease). The MPFS proposed by CMS for 2025, if enacted, is expected to decrease Medicare reimbursement for therapy services by
 approximately 2.8 as compared to the reimbursement rates in effect for most of 2024.

In the final 2020 MPFS rule, CMS clarified that when the physical therapist is involved for the entire duration of the service and the physical therapist assistant PTA provides skilled therapy
 alongside the physical therapist, an identification of the PTA s participation (as denoted by a CQ modifier is not required. Also, when the same service (code) is furnished separately by the physical therapist and PTA, CMS applies the de minimis
 standard to each 15-minute unit of codes, not on the total physical therapist and PTA time of the service. For dates of service on and after January 1, 2022, CMS pays for physical therapy and occupational therapy services provided by PTAs and
 occupational therapist assistants OTAs at 85 of the otherwise applicable Part B payment amount. CMS allows a timed service to be billed without a CQ (for PTA s) or CO (for OTA s) modifier when a PTA or OTA participates in providing care, but
 the physical therapist or occupational therapist meets the Medicare billing requirements without including the PTA s or OTA s minutes. This occurs when the physical therapist or occupational therapist provides more minutes than the 15-minute
 midpoint. The proposed 2025 MPFS final rule does not contain any policy changes concerning the modifiers for services provided by physical therapy and occupational therapist assistants.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The defined terms, with their respective descriptions, used in the following discussions are listed below.

Mature clinics are clinics opened or acquired prior to January 1, 2023, and are still operating as of September 30, 2024.

Net rate per patient visit is net patient revenue related to our physical therapy operations divided by total number of patient visits (defined below) during the
 periods presented.

Patient visits is the number of unique patient visits during the periods presented.

Average daily visits per clinic is patient visits divided by the number of days in which normal business operations were conducted during the periods presented and
 further divided by the average number of clinics in operation during the periods presented.

USPH Net Income was 6.6 million for the 2024 Third Quarter. In accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), the revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest, net of taxes, is not included
 in net income but is charged directly to retained earnings; however, this change is included in the computation of earnings per share.

Table of Contents 

Earnings per share for the 2024 Third Quarter was 0.39. USPH Net Income and earnings per share included a charge of 2.5 million, net of 1.0 million tax, or 0.16 per share, associated with the closure of 32
 clinics during the 2024 Third Quarter. Excluding the clinic closure costs, USPH Net Income was 9.1 million (1) compared to 9.3 million (1) in the comparable prior year period while earnings per share was 0.55 (1) and 0.51 (1) over the same periods, respectively.

USPH Net Income was 22.2 million for the 2024 Nine Months as compared to 27.6 million for the 2023 Nine Months while earnings per share was 1.32 for the 2024 Nine Months compared to 1.72 for the 2023 Nine Months.
 USPH Net Income and earnings per share included a charge of 2.9 million, net of 1.2 million tax, or 0.20 per share, associated with the closure of 43 clinics during the 2024 Nine Months. Excluding the clinic closure costs, USPH Net Income was
 25.1 million (1) compared to 27.7 million (1) in the comparable period while

Non-GAAP Measures

Adjusted EBITDA a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income attributable to our shareholders before interest income, interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, change in fair value of contingent earn-out
 consideration, payments received from the federal government under the Corona virus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act Relief Funds ), changes in revaluation of put-right liability, equity-based awards compensation expense, clinic closure
 costs, business acquisition related costs and other income and related portions for non-controlling interests.

Operating Results, a non-GAAP measure, equals net income attributable to our shareholders less, changes in revaluation of a put-right liability, Relief Funds, clinic closure costs, changes in fair value of contingent
 earn-out consideration, business acquisition related costs and any allocations to non-controlling interests, all net of taxes. Operating Results per share also excludes the impact of the revaluation of redeemable non-controlling interest and the
 associated tax impact.

The following tables provide details of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation and reconcile net income attributable to our shareholders calculated in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted
 EBITDA, Operating Results and other non-GAAP measures. Management believes providing Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results to investors is useful information for comparing our period-to-period results as well as for comparing with other similar
 businesses since most do not have redeemable instruments and therefore have different equity structures. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Results, and other non-GAAP measures, which eliminate certain items described above that can be
 subject to volatility and unusual costs, as the principal measures to evaluate and monitor financial performance period over period.

Adjusted EBITDA, Operating Results and the other non-GAAP measures presented are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Results should not be considered in isolation or as an

Revenues

Net revenue from physical therapy operations increased 12.2 million, or 9.3 , to 142.7 million for the 2024 Third Quarter from 130.5 million for the 2023 Third Quarter. This increase was due primarily to the
 increase in visits from the 21 net clinics added since the comparable prior year period, a 2.4 increase in visits at mature clinics and an increase in net rate per patient visit. Total patient visits increased
 74,097, or 6.0 , to 1,317,051 in the 2024 Third Quarter from 1,242,954 in the 2023 Third Quarter. Average daily visits per clinic was 30.1 for the 2024 Third Quarter compared to 29.7 in the comparable prior year quarter. Net rate per patient
 visit for the 2024 Third Quarter increased to 105.65 from 102.37 for the 2023 Third Quarter, an increase of 3.2 , despite the 1.8 Medicare rate reduction which went into effect at the beginning of 2024. The increase in net rate per
 patient visit was mainly driven by higher reimbursement rates from commercial and other payors as a result of contract negotiations and an increase in workers compensation as a percent of our total net patient revenues.

Other revenues increased approximately 0.3 million, or 8.8 , to 3.6 million for the 2024 Third Quarter from 3.3 million for the 2023 Third Quarter primarily due to the increase in management
 contract revenue since the comparable prior year period.

Operating costs

Operating costs from physical therapy operations increased 12.2 million, or 11.4 , to 119.2 million in the 2024 Third Quarter from 107.0 million in the 2023 Third Quarter primarily driven by the 21 net new clinics
 added since the comparable prior year period and 3.4 million of costs associated with the closure of 32 clinics during the 2024 Third Quarter. Excluding the clinic closure costs, operating costs increased 8.2 (1) , while total operating costs per visit was 88.98 compared to 84.49 over the same periods, respectively. Excluding the clinic closure costs, operating costs per visit was 86.37 in the 2024 Third
 Quarter.

Salaries and related costs (including management contracts) increased to 84.2 million in the 2024 Third Quarter compared to 77.0 million, in the 2023 Third Quarter, an increase of 7.2 million, or
 9.4 . Salaries and related costs per visit (excluding management contracts), increased to 62.47 for the 2024 Third Quarter from 60.35 for the 2023 Third Quarter.

Total rent, supplies, contract labor and other costs related to clinics (excluding management contracts) increased to 29.8 million in the 2024 Third Quarter from 28.5 million in the 2023 Third
 Quarter, an increase of 1.6 million, or 5.7 . On a per visit basis, rent, supplies, contract labor and other costs (excluding management contracts costs), decreased slightly to 22.59 for the 2024 Third Quarter compared to 22.90 for the 2023
 Third Quarter.

Gross Profit

Gross profit from physical therapy operations in the 2024 Third Quarter was 23.5 million with a gross profit margin of 16.5 . Excluding closure costs, gross profit from physical therapy operations was 26.9 million
 (1) , an increase of 3.4 million, or 14.5 , over the 2023 Third Quarter, and the gross profit margin from physical therapy operations was 18.9 (1) in the 2024 Third Quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 18.0 in the 2023 Third Quarter.

Other (Expenses) Income

Interest Expense, Debt and Other

Interest expense decreased 0.1 million to 2.0 million for the 2024 Third Quarter compared to 2.1 million in the 2023 Third Quarter due to a lower outstanding balance on our term loan. The interest
 rate on our credit facility was 4.7 for the 2024 Third Quarter and 4.9 for the 2023 Third Quarter, with an all-in effective interest rate, including all associated costs of 5.4 and 5.6 over the same periods, respectively.

Interest income from investment

Interest income from investing excess cash (primarily proceeds from the secondary offering sale of our stock completed in May 2023) in a high-yield savings account decreased to 1.0 million during the
 2024 Third Quarter from 1.7 million in the 2023 Third Quarter as a result of our lower cash balance, due to cash used for acquisitions, since the comparable prior year period.

Change in fair value of contingent earn-out consideration and put-right liability

We revalued contingent and put-right liabilities related to certain acquisitions and recognized a net non-cash expense (an increase in the related liabilities) of 1.7 million in the 2024 Third
 Quarter and less than 0.1 million in the comparable 2023 Third Quarter. The put-right (expiring in 2027) relates to the potential future purchase of a company within our IIP business. The company provides physical therapy and rehabilitation
 services to hospitals and other ancillary providers in a distinct market area.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate

For both the 2024 Third Quarter and the 2023 Third Quarter, we recognized income of 0.2 million from a joint venture which provides physical therapy services for patients at hospitals. Since we are
 deemed to not have a controlling interest in the joint venture, our investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was 2.6 million in the 2024 Third Quarter compared to 3.6 million during the 2023 Third Quarter while the effective tax rates were 27.9 and 27.8 for the 2024 Third Quarter and the 2023
 Third Quarter respectively.

Revenues

Revenues from physical therapy operations increased 28.7 million, or 7.3 , to 420.6 million in the 2024 Nine Months compared to 391.9 million in the 2023 Nine Months. This increase was primarily due to the
 increase in volume from the 21 net clinics added since the comparable prior year period as well as an increase in net rate per patient visit to 104.71 for 2024 Nine Months from 102.50 for 2023 Nine Months. Total
 patient visits increased 182,804, or 4.9 , to 3,920,388 in the 2024 Nine Months from 3,737,584 in the 2023 Nine Months. Average daily visits per clinic was 30.0 for both 2024 Nine Months and the comparable prior year period. 

Other revenues increased 1.3 million, or 15.0 , to 10.1 million for the 2024 Nine Months from 8.8 million for the 2023 Nine Months due to an increase in management contract revenue since the
 comparable prior year period.

Operating costs

Operating costs from physical therapy operations increased by 31.2 million, or 10.0 to 344.3 million in the 2024 Nine Months from 313.1 million in the 2023 Nine Months primarily driven by costs
 associated with the 21 net new clinics added since the comparable prior year period. On a per visit basis, operating costs (excluding management contracts) increased to 86.32 for the 2024 Nine Months from 82.35 for the 2023 Nine Months.

Total salaries and related costs for physical therapy operations increased to 245.4 million in the 2024 Nine Months from 225.3 million, in the 2023 Nine Months, an increase of 20.1 million, or
 8.9 . Salaries and related costs per visit (excluding management contracts) increased to 61.17 for the 2024 Nine Months from 59.01 for the 2023 Nine Months.

Total rent, supplies, contract labor and other costs related to clinics (excluding management contracts) increased to 89.4 million in the 2024 Nine Months from 82.4 million in the 2023 Nine Months,
 an increase of 7.0 million, or 8.5 . On a per visit, rent, supplies, contract labor and other costs (excluding management contract costs) increased to 22.80 for the 2024 Nine Months compared to 22.04 for the 2023 Nine Months.

The provision for credit losses was 5.1 million for the 2024 Nine Months and 4.6 million for the 2023 Nine Months. As a percentage of net revenues, the provision for credit losses was 1.2 for both

Change in Revaluation of Put-Right Liability

We recorded an expense of 0.1 million on the revaluation of a put right liability for 2024 Nine Months and a gain of 0.2 million for the 2023 Nine Months. The put-right relates to the potential
 future purchase of a company that provides physical therapy and rehabilitation services to hospitals and other ancillary providers in a distinct market area.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate

We recognized income of 0.8 million from a joint venture which provides physical therapy services for patients at hospitals for both the 2024 Nine Months and the 2023 Nine Months. Since we are deemed
 to not have a controlling interest in the joint venture, our investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was 8.8 million in the 2024 Nine Months compared to 10.8 million during the 2023 Nine Months while the effective tax rates were 28.4 and 28.1 over the same periods,
 respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We believe that our business has sufficient cash to allow us to meet our short-term cash requirements. Total cash and cash equivalents were 117.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and 152.8 million
 as of December 31, 2023. We had 140.6 million of outstanding borrowings and 175.0 million in available credit under our Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024, compared to 144.4 million of outstanding borrowings and 175.0 million in
 available credit under our Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2023.

45 

Table of Contents 

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability under our Senior Credit Facilities are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries through at least
 September 30, 2025.

Historically, we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and to cover operational needs. We plan to continue developing new clinics and making acquisitions.
 We have, from time to time, purchased the non-controlling interests of limited partners in our existing partnerships. We may purchase additional non-controlling interests in the future. Generally, any acquisition or purchase of non-controlling
 interests is expected to be accomplished using our cash, financing, or a combination of the two.

We make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect accounts receivable, including applicable deductible and co-payment amounts. Claims are submitted to payors daily, weekly or monthly in accordance
 with our policy or payor s requirements. When possible, we submit our claims electronically. The collection process is time-consuming and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon
 the payment of another payor. Claims under litigation and vehicular incidents can take a year or longer to collect. Medicare and other payor claims relating to new clinics awaiting CMS approval initially may not be submitted for six months or more.
 When all reasonable internal collection efforts have been exhausted, accounts are written off prior to sending them to outside collection firms. With managed care, commercial health plans and self-pay payor type receivables, the write-off generally
 occurs after the account receivable has been outstanding for 120 days or longer. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued 6.8 million related to credit balances, a portion of which is due to patients and payors.

Cash provided by operating activities was 55.5 million for the 2024 Nine Months as compared to 55.1 million for the 2023 Nine Months. This decrease in cash provided was mostly due to the timing of
 payments related to payables and accrued expenses.

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities for the 2024 Nine Months totaled 54.6 million and primarily consisted of 48.9 million used in the purchase of interests in businesses and non-controlling interests
 (temporary and permanent), and 6.7 million of fixed assets purchases. These uses were partially offset by 0.3 million in proceeds from the sale of non-controlling interests (temporary and permanent), and 0.8 million distributions received from
 an unconsolidated affiliate.

Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities for the 2024 Nine Months, totaled 36.8 million and primarily comprised of 19.9 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders, 11.4 million in distributions to
 non-controlling interests (temporary and permanent) and payments of 5.5 million related to notes payable and the term note.

Senior Credit Facilities

On December 5, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with a commitment for a 125.0 million revolving credit facility. This agreement was amended and/or restated in August
 2015, January 2016, March 2017, November 2017, and January 2021. On June 17, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement among Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent Administrative
 Agent and the lenders from time-to-time party thereto.

The Credit Agreement, which matures on June 17, 2027, provides for loans in an aggregate principal amount of 325 million. Such loans will be available through the following facilities (collectively, the Senior Credit
 Facilities ):

1) 

Revolving Facility: 175 million, five-year, revolving credit facility Revolving Facility ), which includes a 12 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a 15 million sublimit for
 swingline loans (each, a Swingline Loan ).

2) 

Term Facility: 150 million term loan facility (the Term Facility ). The Term Facility amortizes in quarterly installments of: (a) 0.625 in each of the first two years, (b) 1.250 in the third and fourth year,
 and (c) 1.875 in the fifth year of the Credit Agreement. The remaining outstanding principal balance of all term loans is due on the maturity date.

The proceeds of the Revolving Facility have been and shall continue to be used by us for working capital and other general corporate purposes of our Company and its subsidiaries, including to fund
 future acquisitions and invest in growth opportunities. The proceeds of the Term Facility were used by us to refinance the indebtedness outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, to pay fees and expenses incurred in
 connection with the loan facilities transactions, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We are permitted to increase the Revolving Facility and/or add one or more tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of (i) 100 million plus (ii) an unlimited additional
 amount, provided that (in the case of clause (ii)), after giving effect to such increases, the pro forma Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) would not exceed 2.0:1.0, and the aggregate amount of all incremental
 increases under the Revolving Facility does not exceed 50,000,000.

The interest rates per annum applicable to the Senior Credit Facilities (other than in respect of Swingline Loans) will be Term SOFR as defined in the agreement plus an applicable margin or, at our
 option, an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period but no less frequently than quarterly and on the date of maturity.

We will also pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each lender under the Revolving Facility, a commitment fee equal to the actual daily excess of each lender s commitment over its
 outstanding credit exposure under the Revolving Facility unused fee ). We may prepay and/or repay the revolving loans and the term loans, and/or terminate the revolving loan commitments, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or
 penalty, subject to certain conditions.

The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the creation of liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and
 dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends, and other payments in respect of equity interests, acquisitions, investments, loans and guarantees, subject, in each case, to customary exceptions, thresholds and baskets. The Credit Agreement includes
 certain financial covenants which include the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. As of September 30,
 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.

Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries (each, a Guarantor ), and our obligations and any Guarantors are secured by a perfected
 first priority security interest in substantially all of our existing and future personal property and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024, 139.5 million (net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 1.2 million) was outstanding on the Term Facility while none was outstanding under the Revolving Facility resulting
 in 175.0 million of credit availability. The interest rate on the Senior Credit Facilities was 4.7 for the 2024 Third Quarter and 4.9 for the 2023 Third Quarter, with an all-in effective interest rate, including all associated costs, of 5.4 and
 5.6 over the same periods, respectively. The interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 4.7 for the 2024 Nine Months and 5.7 for the 2023 Nine Months, with an all-in effective interest rate, including all associated costs, of 5.4 and
 6.9 over the same periods, respectively.

Interest Rate Swap

In May 2022, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, effective on June 30, 2022, with Bank of America, N.A. It has a 150 million notional value adjusted concurrently with scheduled principal
 payments made on the term loan and has a maturity date of June 30, 2027. Beginning in July 2022, we receive 1-month SOFR, and pay a fixed rate of interest of 2.815 on 1-month SOFR on a quarterly basis. The total interest rate in any period also
 includes an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. In connection with the swap, no cash was exchanged between us and the counterparty.

We designated our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge and structured it to be highly effective. Consequently, unrealized gains and losses related to the fair value of the interest rate swap are
 recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the interest rate swap was 1.8 million, a decrease of 1.4 million, net of a 0.5 million, income tax effect, as compared to December 31, 2023. The fair
 value of the interest rate swap is included in Other assets (current and long term) in our consolidated balance sheet while the increase in fair value is presented as unrealized gain in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
 The interest rate swap arrangement has generated 2.8 million in interest savings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average interest rate for the term facility, net of the savings from the swap, in both the 2024 Third Quarter and
 2024 Nine Months was 4.7 .

Notes Payable and Deferred Payments Related to Acquisitions

We generally enter into various notes payable as a means of financing our acquisitions. Our present outstanding notes payable primarily relate to the acquisitions of a business or acquisitions of
 majority interests in such businesses. At September 30, 2024, our remaining outstanding balance on these notes amounted to 3.1 million, of which 0.8 million is due by December 31, 2024, 1.8 million is due in 2025 and 0.5 million is due in 2026.
 Notes are generally payable in equal annual installments of principal over two years plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Interest accrues at various interest rates ranging from 4.0 to 8.5 per annum.

On August 31, 2024, we acquired a 70 equity interest in an eight-clinic practice physical therapy with the original practice owners retaining 30 equity interest. The purchase price for the 70 
 equity interest was approximately 2.0 million. As part of the transaction, we agreed to additional contingent consideration if future operational and financial objectives are met. The maximum payout is 3.6 million. The contingent consideration
 was valued at 3.6 million on August 31, 2024.

On April 30, 2024, we acquired 100 of an IIP business through one of its primary IIP businesses, Briotix Health Limited Partnership, for a purchase price of approximately 24.0 million, of which 0.5
 million was in the form of a note payable. The note accrues interest at 5.0 per annum and the principal and the interest are payable on May 1, 2025. As part of the transaction, we agreed to pay additional contingent consideration if future
 operational objectives are met. There is no maximum payout. The contingent consideration was valued at 2.4 million as of September 30, 2024. We contributed the capital for this purchase and as a result, our interest in the IIP business of Briotix
 Health Limited Partnership increased to 92.1 subsequent to this transaction.

On March 29, 2024, we acquired a 50 equity interest in a nine-clinic physical therapy and hand therapy practice. The original owners of the practice retained the remaining 50 . The purchase price for
 the 50 equity interest was approximately 16.4 million, of which 0.5 million was in the form of a note payable. The note accrues interest of 4.5 per annum and the principal and the interest are payable on March 29, 2026. Additionally, we have an
 obligation to pay an additional amount based on certain future operational objectives being met. There is no maximum payout. The contingent consideration was valued at 0.5 million as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

On September 29, 2023, we acquired a 70 equity interest in a four-clinic physical therapy practice. The owner of the practice retained 30 of the equity interests. The purchase price for the 70 
 equity interest was approximately 6.0 million, of which 5.4 million was paid in cash, and 0.6 million was in the form of a note payable. The note accrues interest at 5.0 per annum and the principal and interest are payable in two installments.
 The first payment of principal and interest of 0.3 million was paid January 2024, and the second installment of 0.3 million is due on September 30, 2025.

In a separate transaction, on September 29, 2023, we acquired a 70 equity interest in a single clinic physical therapy practice. The owner of the practice retained 30 of the equity interests. The
 purchase price for the 70 equity interest was approximately 7.8 million, of which 7.4 million was paid in cash and 0.4 million is a deferred payment due on June 30, 2025.

On July 31, 2023, we acquired a 70 equity interest in a five-clinic practice. The practice s owners retained a 30 equity interest. The purchase price for the 70 equity interest was approximately
 2.1 million, of which 1.8 million was paid in cash and 0.3 million is a deferred payment due on June 30, 2025.

On May 31, 2023, we and a local partner together acquired a 75 interest in a four-clinic physical therapy practice. After the transaction, our ownership interest is 45 , our local partner s ownership
 interest is 30 , and the practice s pre-acquisition owners have a 25 ownership interest. The purchase price for the 75 equity interest was approximately 3.1 million, of which 1.7 million was paid in cash by us, 1.1 million was paid in cash by
 the local partner, and 0.3 million was in the form of a note payable. On July 1, 2024, the note payable of 0.3 million was paid in full 0.2 million was paid by us and 0.1 million was paid by the local partner).

On February 28, 2023, we acquired an 80 interest in a one-clinic physical therapy practice. The practice s owners retained 20 of the equity interests. The purchase price for the 80 equity interest
 was approximately 6.2 million, of which 5.8 million was paid in cash and 0.4 million in the form of a note payable. The note accrues interest at 4.5 per annum and the principal and interest are payable on February 28, 2025.

Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

Certain limited partnership agreements, as amended, provide that, upon the triggering events, we have a call right and the selling entity or individual has a put right for the purchase and sale of the
 limited partnership interest held by the partner. Once triggered, the put right and the call right do not expire, even upon an individual partner s death, and contain no mandatory redemption feature. The purchase price of the partner s limited
 partnership interest upon the exercise of either the put right or the call right is calculated per the terms of the respective agreements and classified as redeemable non-controlling interest (temporary equity) in our consolidated balance sheets.
 The fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests on September 30, 2024 was 186.6 million.

In the event that a limited non-controlling partner s employment ceases at any time after a specified date that is typically between three and five years from the acquisition date, we have agreed to
 certain contractual provisions which enable such minority partners to exercise their right to trigger our repurchase of that partner s non-controlling interest at a predetermined multiple of earnings before interest and taxes.

ITEM 3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We maintain an interest rate swap arrangement which is considered a derivative instrument. Our indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 was the outstanding balance of seller notes from our acquisitions
 of 3.1 million, and an outstanding balance on our term note related to the Credit Agreement of 140.6 million. The Revolving Facility does not have a balance as of September 30, 2024, and is subject to fluctuating interest rates. A 1 change in
 the interest rate would yield no additional interest expense on the facility because of the interest rate swap described above. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information .

 and filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

If our noncompetition covenants with employed therapists are nullified, we may lose staff to competitors.

Many of our employed therapists have contractual non-competition agreements and covenants with the Company which, under certain circumstances, limit the employee s ability to terminate their
 employment with the Company to perform similar services for competing organizations within a defined geography for a specified period time after such termination. The Federal Trade Commission recently passed a Rule which purports to prohibit many
 forms of non-competition agreements with employees and would require the Company, subject to certain exceptions, to nullify certain existing noncompetition agreements with employees. While a federal court recently ruled that the Rule is invalid
 and may not be enforced, if that decision is appealed successfully and the Rule in its current form or in a substantially similar form becomes effective, the Company could suffer a loss of staff which could have a material adverse effect on
 operations.
