near-term. These losses could be significant as the Company executes its business plan. 

These
factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent

if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes
the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Results
of Operations 

Golden
Royal was organized in November 2016 but did not commence operations until September 2018, when it acquired equity in certain oil and
gas properties in Fremont County and Converse County, Wyoming. Then, in December 2018, Golden Royal acquired ownership of precious metal
rights in a parcel of land in Crooks County, Wyoming. All of these properties were acquired from Jacob Roth, who owns over 95 of Golden
Royal s outstanding shares. More recently, Golden Royal directly invested in the mineral rights to five other parcels of land in
Wyoming: three in Crooks County, one in Laramie County, and one in Converse County. 

There
are no mining operations taking place on any of the properties licensed by Golden Royal; accordingly, we recorded no revenue for the
nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. We do not expect to record revenue unless (a) we resell one of our mineral properties, or (b)
we acquire sufficient cash recourses to permit us to participate in a drilling or mining project that yields revenue. 

The
operating expenses that we incurred 6,108 and 28,253 during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and
 16,115 and 50,707 during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively) were
primarily attributable to the costs of sustaining Golden Royal s initial administrative operations. It is usually the case
that the amounts of operating expenses are relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter, as our expenses are attributable to recurrent
quarterly production of SEC filings, which involve bookkeeping, accounting, legal, and other service expenses. However, operating
expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 were significantly lower than in the nine months ended June 30, 2023 because of the
timing of our audits and SEC filings. 

By
reason of the expenses described above, Golden Royal incurred net losses of 6,108 and 28,253 during the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2024, respectively, and 16,115 and 50,707 during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 ,
respectively. We will continue to incur net losses until we initiate revenue-producing operations. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
operations used 15,563 in cash during the nine months ended June 30, 2024, and 27,056 in cash during the nine months ended June 30,
2023. Our use of cash during these periods was less than our net loss primarily because we increased our liabilities. The cash used in
operations was provided by advances from Jacob Roth, our Chief Executive Officer. 

At
June 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 286,227, an increase of 28,253 as compared to the deficit of 257,974 at September
30, 2023. The increased deficit is primarily attributable to increases in our accounts payable and due to officer balances. 

In
order for us to initiate participation in mineral exploration projects, we estimate that we will require approximately 2.5 million in
capital. We plan to obtain that capital by issuing equity securities, either capital stock or convertible debt. To date, however, we
have received no commitments for funds. Accordingly, the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to
our fiscal 2023 and 2022 financial statements states that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. That doubt will be alleviated only when we obtain the funds necessary to initiate profitable operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

There
were no recent accounting pronouncements that have or will have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As of June 30, 2024, Jacob Roth, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have the following material weaknesses: 

We
 have inadequate control activities to prevent or detect material misstatements. Specifically, there are no controls in place to prevent
 users from manipulating financial data or entering inaccurate data into the Company s accounting software. Additionally, there
 is only one employee responsible for accounting functions, which prevents us from segregating duties within our internal control
 system. Lastly, our Chief Financial Officer lacks the knowledge and expertise to ensure the financial statements are properly recorded
 under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

We
 have an inadequate control environment. Specifically, we have not developed sufficient policies or documentation concerning our existing
 financial processes, risk assessment processes, and information and communication processes. Additionally, we have no monitoring
 activities in place and we lack policies that require formal written approval for related party transactions. 

Based
on his evaluation, Mr. Roth concluded that the Company s system of disclosure controls and procedures was not effective as of June
30, 2024, for the reasons described here. 

Changes
in Internal Controls . There was no change in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) identified in connection with the evaluation described in the preceding paragraph that occurred
during Golden Royal s third fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect Golden Royal s
internal control over financial reporting.
