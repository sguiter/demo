Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. 
 Notes to Condensed Consolid ated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2024 
 (Unaudited) 
 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately beds in states and Puerto Rico. Basis of Presentation The business of the Company is conducted through limited liability companies, partnerships and C-corporations. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of majority interests and exclusive rights granted to the Company as the controlling member of an entity. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations have been included. The Company s fiscal year ends on December 31 and interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or any other interim period. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. The information contained in these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on February 28, 2024. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year to conform to the current year presentation.

Revenue 

The Company receives payments from the following sources for services rendered in its facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS and other programs; and (iv) individual patients and clients. The Company determines the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience. Most of the Company s facilities have contracts containing variable consideration. However, it is unlikely a significant reversal of revenue will occur when the uncertainty is resolved, and therefore, the Company has included the variable consideration in the estimated transaction price. Subsequent changes resulting from a patient s ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense, which is included as a component of other operating expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Bad debt expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was not significant.

Approximately million shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately million and million, respectively, of outstanding shares of restricted stock and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option awards have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding-diluted. These shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in the condensed consolidated statement of operations because the net loss for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 causes such securities to be anti-dilutive. Approximately million shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

All of the Company s definite-lived intangible assets are fully amortized. The Company s licenses and accreditations, trade names and certificates of need have indefinite lives and are, therefore, not subject to amortization. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recorded non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of million, million, million and million, respectively, related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

 billion of relief to eligible healthcare providers. The Company accounts for government grants by analogizing to the grant model in accordance with International Accounting Standard 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance , and as such, has recognized income from grants in line with the recognition of expenses or the loss of revenues for which the grants are intended to compensate. The Company recognizes grants once both of the following conditions are met: (i) the Company is able to comply with the relevant terms and conditions of the grant and (ii) the grant will be received. The Company has participated in certain relief programs offered through the CARES Act, including receipt of funds relating to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund PHSSE Fund ), also known as the Provider Relief Fund, and the American Rescue Plan ARP Rural Payments for Hospitals. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded million of income from provider relief fund related to ARP funds received. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded million of income from provider relief fund related to ARP funds received and repaid the remaining balance of ARP funds to eliminate the liability. Healthcare providers were required to sign an attestation confirming receipt of the PHSSE Fund amounts and agree to the terms and conditions of payment. Under the terms and conditions for receipt of the payment, the Company was allowed to use the funds to cover lost revenues and healthcare costs related to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 COVID-19 ), and the Company was required to properly and fully document the use of these funds to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The reporting of these funds is subject to future audit for compliance with the terms and conditions. The Company recognized PHSSE Fund amounts to the extent it had qualifying COVID-19 expenses or lost revenues as permitted under the terms and conditions. 

 million per claim and million for certain other claims through August 31, 2024 and million per claim, million per claim for certain other claims and million for certain batched claims thereafter. The Company has obtained reinsurance coverage from a third-party to cover claims in excess of those limits. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of million or million in the aggregate for certain other claims through August 31, 2024 and million or million in the aggregate for certain other claims thereafter. The Company s reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place.

million and punitive damages of million. This award far exceeded the Company s reasonable expectation based on the previously resolved complaints and far exceeded any precedent for comparable cases. On October 30, 2023, the Company and Desert Hills entered into settlement agreements in connection with the Inman Litigation, as well as two other related cases Rael v. Garcia, et al., Case No. D-117-CV-2019-00135 and Endicott-Quinones v. Garcia, et al., Case No. D-117-CV-2019-00137 (together with the Inman Litigation, the Cases ). The settlement agreements for the Cases were approved by the District Court in December 2023 and fully resolve each of the Cases with no admission of liability or wrongdoing by either the Company or Desert Hills. On January 19, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreements, the Company paid an aggregate amount of million in exchange for the release and discharge of all claims arising from, relating to, concerning or with respect to all harm, injuries or damages asserted in the Cases or that may be asserted in the future by the plaintiffs in the Cases. On January 30, 2024, a sixth lawsuit styled CNRAG, Inc. as Legal Guardian of A.C. v. Garcia et al., No. D-117-CV-2024-00045 was filed in the District Court alleging similar claims as the previous five lawsuits in the Desert Hills Litigation. The ward in this sixth lawsuit was referenced in prior criminal charges against Garcia in January 2019; however, prior to this lawsuit, neither the ward nor guardian made contact with the Company about a possible claim. The Company determined that a lawsuit from this plaintiff was unlikely because no claims had ever been asserted and the statute of limitations had expired. Plaintiff s allegations assert certain claims, which, if true, may toll the statute of limitations. At this time, the Company is not able to quantify the ultimate liability, if any, in connection with this sixth lawsuit. No additional victims are referenced in the prior criminal charges against Garcia. Securities Litigation On April 1, 2019, a consolidated complaint was filed against the Company and certain former and current officers in the lawsuit styled St. Clair County Employees Retirement System v. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00988 , which is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The complaint is brought on behalf of a class consisting of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased securities of the Company between April 30, 2014 and November 15, 2018, and alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On September 30, 2022, the court entered an order certifying a class consisting of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company between April 30, 2014 and November 15, 2018.

million in exchange for the release and discharge of any civil or administrative monetary claim arising from the 2017 OIG/DOJ Investigation. On October 1, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the 2017 OIG/DOJ Settlement Agreement, the Company paid an aggregate amount of million, plus interest, to the federal government. The Company expects to pay million, plus interest, representing the balance of the settlement amount owed to four states that participated in the 2017 OIG/DOJ Investigation, in the coming months, in accordance with the terms of the 2017 OIG/DOJ Settlement Agreement. Prior to entering into the 2017 OIG/DOJ Settlement Agreement, the Company recorded million within other accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in respect of the anticipated financial impact of resolving the 2017 OIG/DOJ Investigation. In September 2024, the Company received a voluntary request for information from the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York (the SDNY ), as well as a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (the W.D.Mo. ), related to, among other things, its admissions, length of stay and billing practices. In addition, Lakeland Hospital Acquisition, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, also received a grand jury subpoena from the W.D.Mo. on the same day regarding similar subject matter. Later that month, the SDNY withdrew its request, and the investigations are now being led

Credit Facility On March 17, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended the Credit Facility ), which provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Facility and a senior secured term loan facility in an initial principal amount of million (as increased by the Incremental Term Loans (as defined below), the Term Loan Facility ), each maturing on . The Revolving Facility further provides for a million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit. On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility (the First Amendment ), which replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), as the reference rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as determined for a term of, at the Company s option, one, three or six months, plus an 

 12 

Adjusted Term SOFR ). After giving effect to the First Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company s option, either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from to or (ii) a base rate plus a margin ranging from to , in each case, depending on the consolidated total net leverage ratio. In addition, an unused fee that varies according to the consolidated total net leverage ratio of the Company ranging from to is payable quarterly in arrears based on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the Revolving Facility. On January 18, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Facility (the Second Amendment ), which provides for the incurrence of additional senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of million (the Incremental Term Loans ). Such Incremental Term Loans are structured as an increase of the Term Loan Facility. The maturity date, the leverage-based pricing grid, mandatory prepayment events and other terms applicable to the Incremental Term Loans are substantially identical to those applicable to the initial million term loans incurred under the Term Loan Facility. After giving effect to the Incremental Term Loans, the Credit Facility requires quarterly principal repayments for the Term Loan Facility of approximately million for each quarter ending from December 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025 and million for each quarter ending from June 30, 2025 to December 31, 2025. The remaining outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility is due on the maturity date of . The Company has the ability to increase the amount of the Credit Facility, which may take the form of increases to the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan Facility or the issuance of one or more incremental term loan facilities (collectively, the Incremental Facilities ), upon obtaining additional commitments from new or existing lenders and the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent for such Incremental Facilities. Such Incremental Facilities may not exceed the sum of (i) the greater of million and an amount equal to of the consolidated EBITDA of the Company at the time of determination (the Incremental Fixed Basket and (ii) additional amounts that would not cause the Company s consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio to exceed to 1.0 (the Incremental Ratio Basket ). The Incremental Term Loans were incurred in reliance on the Incremental Ratio Basket, leaving the full amount of the Incremental Fixed Basket available for any future Incremental Facilities. Subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of the Company s existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries are required to guarantee the repayment of the Company s obligations under the Credit Facility.

 Overview 
 Our business strategy is to become the indispensable behavioral healthcare provider for the high-acuity and complex needs patient population. We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high-quality, cost-effective behavioral healthcare services, while growing our business, increasing profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. This strategy includes five growth pathways: expansions of existing facilities, joint venture partnerships, de novo facilities, acquisitions and expansion across our continuum of care. At September 30, 2024, we operated 260 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 11,300 beds in 38 states and Puerto Rico. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we added 275 beds, consisting of 67 beds to existing facilities and 208 beds added through the opening of four wholly-owned facilities. 
 20 

We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.S. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count in the U.S. through acquisitions, wholly-owned de novo facilities, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.

We believe that we are well positioned to help meet the growing demand for behavioral healthcare services and recorded revenue growth of 8.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Similar with many other healthcare providers and other industries across the country, we continue to navigate a tight labor market. While we experienced higher wage inflation recently compared to long-term historical averages, we have seen stability in our labor costs and our proactive focus helps us manage through this environment. We remain focused on ensuring that we have the level of staff to meet the demand in our markets across 38 states and Puerto Rico.

(a) Results for the periods presented include facilities we have operated more than one year and exclude certain closed services. 

(b) Average length of stay is defined as patient days divided by admissions. 

(c) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income before provision for income taxes, equity-based compensation expense, loss on impairment, transaction, legal and other costs, interest expense, legal settlement expense and depreciation and amortization. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical indicator to measure performance and to develop strategic objectives and operating plans. Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

Revenue 
 Our revenue is primarily derived from services rendered to patients for inpatient psychiatric and substance abuse care, outpatient psychiatric care and adolescent residential treatment. We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS and other programs; and (iv) individual patients and clients. We determine the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience.

Our strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund our operations in the U.S. 
 Desert Hills Litigation 
 As described in more detail in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, on October 30, 2023, we entered into settlement agreements in connection with the Cases. The settlement agreements were approved by the District Court in December 2023 and fully resolve each of the Cases with no admission of liability or wrongdoing by us. On January 19, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of 400.0 million in exchange for the release and discharge of all claims arising from, relating to, concerning or with respect to all harm, injuries or damages asserted in the Cases or that may be asserted in the future by the plaintiffs in the Cases. 
 Credit Facility 
 On March 17, 2021, we entered into the Credit Facility, which provides for a 600.0 million Revolving Facility and a Term Loan Facility in an initial principal amount of 425.0 million, each maturing on March 17, 2026. The Revolving Facility further provides for a 20.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit. 
 As a part of the closing of the Credit Facility on March 17, 2021, we (i) refinanced and terminated our prior credit facilities under an amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2012 and (ii) financed the redemption of all of our outstanding 5.625 Senior Notes due 2023. 
 On March 30, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment, which replaced LIBOR as the reference rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility with Adjusted Term SOFR. After giving effect to the First Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.375 to 2.250 or (ii) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.375 to 1.250 , in each case, depending on our consolidated total net leverage ratio. In addition, an unused fee that varies according to our consolidated total net leverage ratio ranging from 0.200 to 0.350 is payable quarterly in arrears based on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the Revolving Facility. 
 The interest rates and the unused line fee on unused commitments related to the Credit Facility are based upon the following pricing tiers:

On January 18, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment, which provides for the incurrence of 350.0 million of Incremental Term Loans. Such Incremental Term Loans are structured as an increase of the Term Loan Facility. The maturity date, the leverage-based pricing grid, mandatory prepayment events and other terms applicable to the Incremental Term Loans are substantially 
 26 

identical to those applicable to the initial 425.0 million term loans incurred under the Term Loan Facility. After giving effect to the Incremental Term Loans, the Credit Facility requires quarterly principal repayments for the Term Loan Facility of approximately 15.4 million for each quarter ending from December 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025 and 20.5 million for each quarter ending from June 30, 2025 to December 31, 2025. The remaining outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility is due on the maturity date of March 17, 2026. 
 We have the ability to increase the amount of the Credit Facility, which may take the form of increases to the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan Facility or the issuance of one or more Incremental Facilities, upon obtaining additional commitments from new or existing lenders and the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent for such Incremental Facilities. Such Incremental Facilities may not exceed the sum of (i) the Incremental Fixed Basket and (ii) the Incremental Ratio Basket. The Incremental Term Loans were incurred in reliance on the Incremental Ratio Basket, leaving the full amount of the Incremental Fixed Basket available for any future Incremental Facilities. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries are required to guarantee the repayment of our obligations under the Credit Facility. We and such guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all personal property assets as collateral for the obligations under the Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Facility contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay junior indebtedness and enter into affiliate transactions, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. In addition, the Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring us on a consolidated basis to maintain, as of the last day of any consecutive four fiscal quarter period, a consolidated total net leverage ratio of not more than 4.5 to 1.0 (which may be increased to 5.0 to 1.0 for a period of up to four consecutive fiscal quarters following the consummation of certain material acquisitions) and an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Facility also includes events of default customary for facilities of this type and upon the occurrence of such events of default, among other things, all outstanding loans under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, the lenders commitments terminated, and/or the lenders may exercise collateral remedies. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 210.0 million on the Revolving Facility and repaid 15.0 million of the balance outstanding. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed 40.0 million on the Revolving Facility and repaid 35.0 million of the balance outstanding. We had 321.5 million of availability under the Revolving Facility and had standby letters of credit outstanding of 3.5 million related to security for the payment of claims required by our workers compensation insurance program at September 30, 2024. 
 Senior Notes 
 5.500 Senior Notes due 2028 
 On June 24, 2020, we issued 450.0 million of 5.500 Senior Notes. The 5.500 Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2021. 
 5.000 Senior Notes due 2029 
 On October 14, 2020, we issued 475.0 million of 5.000 Senior Notes. The 5.000 Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 5.000 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2021. 
 The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or sell assets; (iv) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (v) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets; and (vii) create liens on assets. 
 The Senior Notes issued by us are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guaranteed our obligations under the Credit Facility. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. 
 We may redeem the Senior Notes at our option, in whole or part, at the dates and amounts set forth in the indentures.

Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. Our long-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 was composed of 917.1 million of fixed-rate debt and 959.4 million of variable-rate debt with interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin. Based on our borrowing level at September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would decrease our pretax income on an annual basis by approximately 9.6 million. 
 Item 4.	Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 Information with respect to this item may be found in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Item 1A.	Ri sk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, an investor should carefully consider the factors discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are incorporated herein by reference. The risks described herein and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially, adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
 We are and in the future could become the subject of additional governmental investigations, regulatory actions, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal proceedings. 
 Healthcare companies in the U.S. may be subject to investigations by various governmental agencies. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, audit reports and other inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. See Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about pending investigations. These investigations can result in repayment obligations, substantial monetary penalties and fines, the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement, exclusion from participation in governmental health programs, negative publicity and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. Responding to subpoenas, investigations and other lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, as well as defending ourselves in and resolving such matters, has caused and will continue to cause us to incur significant costs, including legal expense and the diversion of management resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, governmental investigations, regulatory actions and other legal proceedings could result in us becoming the subject of negative publicity or unfavorable media attention, whether warranted or unwarranted, that could have a significant, adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock or adversely impact our reputation. 
 Further, under the False Claims Act, private parties are permitted to bring qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Because qui tam lawsuits are filed under seal, we could be named in one or more such lawsuits of which we are not aware. We may also be subject to substantial reputational harm as a result of the public announcement of any investigation into such claims. 
 Other than as described in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time, including those described in the aforementioned sections of this report, or the timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of developments in those matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
