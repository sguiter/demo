per share ("common stock"), authorized under the Company s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation ), from to (the Authorized Shares Increase ). On February 20, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware effectuating the Authorized Shares Increase. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as described below, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern exists. 
 
 The Company is not yet generating revenue, has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as it executes on its product development plan and may never become profitable. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. Due to uncertainties regarding future operations of the Company for an ongoing Phase 1b/2a trial of AJ201, a potential Phase 3 safety study for IV tramadol, and the expansion of the Company's development portfolio within neuroscience with the consummation of the transaction with Baergic Bio, Inc. ("Baergic"), the Company will need to secure additional funds through equity or debt offerings, including through at-the-market ("ATM") offerings or other potential sources, the timing of which is unknown at this time. The Company will require additional funds to cover operational expenses over the next 12 months. The Company cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all. These factors individually and collectively cause substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern to exist within one year from the date of this report. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company were unable to continue as a going concern.

and million, respectively, for the modification of certain of its existing warrants and issuance of warrants during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 see Note 7 ). Diluted net loss per share excludes unvested restricted stock, preferred shares and the effect of shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and warrants, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Dividends declared are paid and set aside among the holders of shares of common stock and Class A Preferred stock pro-rata on an as-if-converted basis. 
 
 The following table sets forth the potential common shares that could potentially dilute basic income per share in the future that were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented: 

Warrants 
 Options 
 Class A Preferred shares 
 Total potential dilutive effect 

The shares held in abeyance from the May 2024 Warrant Inducement (as defined in Note 7 as of September 30, 2024 were included in the September 30, 2024 computation of diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 since no additional consideration is due upon issuance of the shares. 

million to Revogenex upon execution of the exclusive license, and on June 17, 2015, Fortress paid an additional million to Revogenex after receiving all the assets specified in the agreement. In December 2019, million became due to Revogenex in accordance with the Company s submission of its NDA. In addition, under the terms of the agreement, Revogenex is eligible to receive an additional milestone payment totaling million upon the approval of IV tramadol from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") as well as royalty payments on net sales of the product ranging in the high single digits to low double digits. 
 
 On October 29, 2018, the Company and Zaklady Farmaceutyczne Polpharma Polpharma extended the term of their exclusive supply agreement for drug product of IV tramadol to eight years from the date of the launch of the product. In addition, under the terms of the amended agreement, Polpharma is eligible to receive a milestone payment totaling million upon the approval of IV tramadol from the FDA, as well as a low single digit royalty on net sales of the product for five years after launch. 
 
 Baergic Licenses 
 
 In December 2019, Baergic entered into two license agreements: (i) a license agreement (the AZ License with AstraZeneca AB AZ to acquire an exclusive license to patent and related intellectual property rights pertaining to their proprietary compound Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A alpha 2 3 (GABAA 2,3 positive allosteric modulators; and (ii) a license agreement (the CCHMC License with Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center CCHMC to acquire patent and related intellectual property rights pertaining to a GABA inhibitor program for neurological disorders. Baergic paid an upfront fee of million to AZ and million to CCHMC, as well as issued common shares of Baergic of approximately and of Baergic to each at the time of the license agreement, respectively. 
 
 Development milestones totaling approximately million in the aggregate are due upon achievement of each milestone. Commercial and sales-based milestone payments totaling approximately million are due upon achievement of each milestone, as well as royalty payments in the low to high single digits on any future aggregate, annual, worldwide net sales. 
 
 AnnJi License Agreement 
 
 On February 28, 2023, the Company entered into a license agreement with AnnJi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. ("AnnJi"), whereby the Company obtained an exclusive license (the "AnnJi License Agreement") from AnnJi for certain intellectual property rights pertaining to AJ201. Under the AnnJi License Agreement, in exchange for exclusive rights to the intellectual property underlying the AJ201 product candidates, the Company agreed to pay million, of which million was paid on April 27, 2023 and million was paid on September 8, 2023. The Company is also obligated to make additional payments over the course of the AnnJi License Agreement including: reimbursement payments of up to million in connection with the product s Phase 1b/2a clinical trial (which AnnJi is administering with Joint Steering Committee Oversight before assigning the Investigational New Drug Application ("IND") to the Company upon such trial s conclusion, and which is reflective of market pricing for the services to be received), up to million in connection with certain development milestones pertaining to the first indication in the U.S., up to million in connection with certain drug development milestones pertaining to additional indications and development outside the U.S., up to million upon the achievement of certain net sales milestones ranging from million to million in annual net sales, and royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales ranging from mid-single digits (on annual net sales at or below million) to the low double digits (on annual net sales equal to or greater than million), which are subject to potential diminution in certain circumstances. 
 
 The license provided under the AnnJi License Agreement is exclusive as to all oral forms of AJ201 for use in all indications (other than androgenetic alopecia and Alzheimer s disease) in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Israel. The AnnJi License Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and provisions related to confidentiality, diligence, indemnification and intellectual property protection. The Company will initially be obligated to obtain both clinical and commercial supply of AJ201 exclusively through AnnJi. AnnJi retains the manufacturing rights for AJ201 and the Company has the option to acquire those rights from AnnJi as described in the AnnJi License Agreement. 
 
 In connection with the signing of the AnnJi License Agreement, the Company issued shares of its common stock to AnnJi First Tranche Shares at a fair value of million on March 30, 2023. The Company issued shares of common stock ("Second Tranche Shares"), recorded at a fair value of million, on September 26, 2023 upon enrollment of the eighth patient in the ongoing Phase 1b/2a SBMA clinical trial. The fair value was calculated based on the closing price of the Company's stock as of February 28, 2023, the date the Company entered into the AnnJi License Agreement. In the event that the common stock of the Company ceases to be traded on a national securities exchange, AnnJi has the right to sell common stock of the Company back to the Company at a price of per share subject to the terms in the AnnJi License Agreement. 
 
 In connection with execution of the AnnJi License Agreement, Avenue entered into a registration rights agreement with AnnJi, pursuant to which Avenue filed a registration statement to register the resale of the First Tranche Shares and Second Tranche Shares issued to AnnJi. The Company filed such registration statement on Form S- 3 with the SEC on June 16, 2023, which was declared effective on June 27, 2023.

Thus, the Class A Preferred Stock will at all times constitute a voting majority. 
 
 Each share of Class A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock (the Conversion Ratio ), subject to certain adjustments. If the Company, at any time effects a subdivision or combination of the outstanding Common Stock (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reverse stock split or otherwise), the applicable Conversion Ratio in effect immediately before that subdivision is proportionately decreased or increased, as applicable, so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Class A Preferred Stock shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, in proportion to such increase or decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Additionally, if any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Company occurs in which the Common Stock (but not the Class A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property, then each share of Class A Preferred Stock becomes convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon conversion of one share of the Class A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction. Pursuant to the reverse stock splits by the Company in September 2022 and April 2024, the Class A Preferred Stock has a Conversion Ratio of Class A Preferred to one share of Common Stock. 
 
 Common Stock

On February 20, 2024, the Company filed the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware effectuating the Authorized Shares Increase. 
 
 Holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not have cumulative voting rights. An election of directors by the stockholders is determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive proportionately any dividends as may be declared by the Company's Board of Directors, subject to any preferential dividend rights of outstanding preferred stock. 
 
 In the event of the Company's liquidation or dissolution, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive proportionately all assets available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that the Company may designate and issue in the future. 
 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On April 25, 2024, the Company filed an amendment (the Reverse Split Amendment to its Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the 1 -for- reverse stock split of the Company's shares of common stock ("Reverse Stock Split"). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split were combined and converted into one share of common stock without any change in the par value per share. The Reverse Stock Split became effective on April 26, 2024, and the common stock was quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market on a post-split basis at the open of business on April 26, 2024. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would have otherwise been entitled to a fraction of one share of common stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split instead received one whole share of common stock. The Company issued shares of common stock to shareholders who had been entitled to a fraction of one share. 
 
 All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Certain matters discussed in this report may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this report, including statements that express our intentions, plans, objectives, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, should, project, will, would, and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections made by management about our business, our industry and other conditions affecting our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause such outcomes and results to differ include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties arising from: 

the fact that we currently have no drug products for sale and that our success is dependent on our product candidates receiving regulatory approval and being successfully commercialized; 

the possibility that serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of our current or future product candidates, such that we would need to abandon or limit development of some of our product candidates; 

our ability to successfully develop, partner, or commercialize any of our current or future product candidates including AJ201, IV tramadol, and BAER-101; 

the substantial doubt raised about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing; 

the significant losses we have incurred since inception and our expectation that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future; 

our need for substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, which unavailability could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts; 

our reliance on third parties for several aspects of our operations; 

our reliance on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate, unreliable, or unacceptable to regulatory authorities; 

the possibility that we may not receive regulatory approval for any or all of our product candidates, or that such approval may be significantly delayed due to scientific or regulatory reasons; 

the fact that even if one or more of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, they will remain subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny; 

the effects of current and future laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security, and other healthcare laws and regulations; 

the effects of competition for our product candidates and the potential for new products to emerge that provide different or better therapeutic alternatives for our targeted indications; 

the possibility that the government or third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our product candidates or any future products; 

our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates; 

our exposure to potential product liability claims; 

related to the protection of our intellectual property and our potential inability to maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products; 

our ability to maintain compliance with the obligations under our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, without which licenses and arrangements we could lose rights that are important to our business; 

the fact that Fortress Biotech, Inc. ("Fortress") controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and has rights to receive significant share grants annually; and 

and the risks described under the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). 

The forward-looking statements contained in this report reflect our views and assumptions as of the effective date of this report. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they may affect us. Except as required by law, we assume no responsibility for updating any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report, except as required by applicable law. 
 
 We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. In addition, with respect to all of our forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. Avenue or the Company is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of neurologic diseases. Our product candidates include AJ201 for the treatment of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy ("SBMA", also known as Kennedy's Disease), an intravenous formulation of tramadol ("IV tramadol"), a schedule IV opioid for the treatment of post-operative acute pain, and BAER-101 for the treatment of epilepsy and panic disorders. We may in the future acquire additional product candidates. 
 
 Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 10.1 million and 11.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 101.0 million. Substantially all our net losses resulted from costs incurred for research and development, and general and administrative purposes. 
 
 We expect to continue to incur research and development costs and general and administrative costs and incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the development of our product candidates. 
 
 We intend to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities or other arrangements to fund our operations, research and development activity or regulatory approval activity; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity may dilute existing stockholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding shares of our common stock. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders. We may also seek financing through strategic partnerships for some or all of our portfolio assets. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. 
 
 We are a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress. For related party transactions, see Note 4 to our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on February 9, 2015. Our executive offices are located at 1111 Kane Concourse, Suite 301, Bay Harbor Islands, FL 33154. Our telephone number is (781) 652-4500, and our email address is info@avenuetx.com. 
 
 AJ201 
 
 In February 2023, we announced that we entered into a license agreement (the AnnJi License Agreement with AnnJi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. AnnJi whereby the Company obtained an exclusive license from AnnJi to intellectual property rights pertaining to the molecule known as JM17, which activates Nrf1 and Nrf2, enhances androgen receptor degradation and underlies AJ201, a clinical product candidate currently in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in the United States U.S. for the treatment of SBMA. 
 
 Under the AnnJi License Agreement, in exchange for exclusive rights to the intellectual property underlying the AJ201 product candidate, the Company paid an initial cash license fee of 3.0 million. The Company issued shares of its common stock and is obligated to make additional payments over the course of the AnnJi License Agreement including reimbursement payments of up to 10.8 million in connection with the product s Phase 1b/2a clinical trial. 
 
 The license provided under the AnnJi License Agreement is exclusive as to all oral forms of AJ201 for use in all indications (other than androgenetic alopecia and Alzheimer s disease) in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Israel. The AnnJi License Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and provisions related to confidentiality, diligence, indemnification and intellectual property protection. The Company is initially obligated to obtain both clinical and commercial supply of AJ201 exclusively through AnnJi. 
 
 The 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial enrolled 25 patients, randomly assigned to AJ201 (600mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess safety and tolerability of AJ201 in subjects with clinically and genetically defined SBMA. Secondary endpoints include pharmacodynamic data measuring change from baseline in mutant androgen receptor protein levels in skeletal muscle and changes in the fat and muscle composition as seen on MRI scans. Further details on the study can be found using the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05517603. Information on clinicaltrials.gov does not constitute part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 In May 2024, we announced last patient last visit in the Phase 1b/2a trial and anticipate top-line data readout around year-end 2024. 
 
 IV Tramadol 
 
 We participated in a Type C meeting with the FDA in March 2023 to discuss a proposed study protocol to assess the risk of respiratory depression related to opioid stacking on IV tramadol relative to an approved opioid analgesic. We announced in April 2023 that we received official meeting minutes from the Type C meeting with the FDA. The Type C meeting minutes indicate that we are in agreement with the FDA on a majority of the proposed protocol items and are in active discussion about remaining open items. The minutes indicate that the FDA also agrees that a successful study will support the submission of a complete response to the second Complete Response Letter for IV tramadol pending final agreement on a statistical analysis plan and a full review of the submitted data in the complete response as well as concurrence from the DAAAP. 
 
 In January 2024, we announced that we reached final agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 safety study protocol and statistical analysis approach, including the primary endpoint. The final non-inferiority study is designed to assess the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression related to opioid stacking on IV tramadol compared to IV morphine. The study will randomize approximately 300 post bunionectomy patients to IV tramadol or IV morphine for pain relief administered during a 48-hour post-operative period. Of note, this study design was used in the first of two Phase 3 trials. In a Phase 3 safety study to be conducted, patients will have access to IV hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid, for rescue of breakthrough pain. The primary endpoint is a composite of elements indicative of respiratory depression. 
 
 We plan to initiate the study as soon as possible, subject to having the necessary financing.

BAER-101 (novel 2/3 subtype-selective GABA A PAM) 
 
 Baergic is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company founded in December 2019 that focuses on the development of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of neurologic disorders. Baergic was acquired by the Company pursuant to a stock contribution agreement (the Contribution Agreement with Fortress, in order to strategically align with Avenue s goals of building a rare and neurologic pipeline. Baergic s pipeline currently consists of a single compound, BAER-101, a novel 2/3 subtype-selective GABA A positive allosteric modulator. BAER-101 (formerly known as AZD7325) was originally developed by AstraZeneca and has an established safety profile in early clinical trials including over 700 patients. 
 
 In August 2023, we reported preclinical data for BAER-101 from an in vivo evaluation in SynapCell s Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rate from the Strasbourg GAERS model of absence epilepsy. The GAERS model mimics behavioral, electrophysiological and pharmacological features of human absence seizures and has shown to be an early informative indicator of efficacy in anti-seizure drug development. In the model, BAER-101 demonstrated full suppression of seizure activity with a minimal effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg administered orally. The data were subsequently presented at the American Epilepsy Society AES 2023 Annual Meeting in December 2023 and at the American Society for Experimental Neurotherapeutics ASENT 2024 Annual Meeting in March 2024. The data were also published in Drug Development Research in February 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the Management s Discussion and Analysis of the Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 18, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). There were no material changes in our critical accounting estimates or accounting policies from December 31, 2023. 
 
 Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company, meaning that either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we chose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in the 2023 Form 10-K, have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and certain other matters, and smaller reporting companies are permitted to delay adoption of certain recent accounting. 
 
 Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position for the periods presented and are stated in U.S. dollars. The Company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the accounts of the Company s subsidiary, Baergic. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Because the Company owns less than 100 of Baergic, the Company records net loss attributable to non-controlling interests in its consolidated statements of operations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in Baergic by the respective non-controlling parties. The Company continually assesses whether changes to existing relationships or future transactions may result in the consolidation or deconsolidation of its' subsidiary.

Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 101.0 million. While we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone payments, research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships and/or product sales, our product candidate are still in development and may never be successfully developed or commercialized. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses from operations for the foreseeable future, and there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenues.

Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with pre-commercialization validation manufacturing, costs associated with regulatory filings, laboratory costs and other supplies. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were 2.3 million and 0.9 million, respectively. The increase of 1.4 million was associated with a 1.6 million increase in pre-clinical and clinical development costs, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. 
 
 We expect our research and development activities to continue as we attempt to gain regulatory approval for our existing product candidates, reflecting costs associated with the following: 

employee-related expenses; 

license fees and milestone payments related to in-licensed product and technology; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials; 

the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and 

costs associated with non-clinical activities, and regulatory interactions, submissions, and approvals. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist principally of professional fees for legal and consulting services, market research, personnel-related costs, public reporting company related costs and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We expect our general and administrative costs to continue as we seek potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 0.8 million and 1.2 million, respectively. The decrease of 0.4 million is related to a decrease of 0.3 million in personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation and 0.1 million in professional fees. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income was 51,000 and 9,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities was a gain of 19 thousand and 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Warrants to purchase common stock that are required to be classified as a liability are valued at fair market value at each reporting period. The change in the fair value of warrant liabilities was primarily due to the modification of the exercise price as part of a warrant inducement, the exercise of warrants classified as liabilities, and fluctuation in our stock price.

Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with pre-commercialization validation manufacturing, costs associated with regulatory filings, laboratory costs and other supplies. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were 6.1 million and 5.1 million, respectively. The increase of 1.0 million is primarily associated with a 1.0 million increase in pre-clinical and clinical development costs. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, research and development - licenses acquired expenses were 4.2 million related to the AJ201 license acquisition, with no comparable expense in 2024. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist principally of professional fees for legal and consulting services, market research, personnel-related costs, public reporting company related costs and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We expect our general and administrative costs to continue as we seek potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 3.6 million and 3.0 million, respectively. The increase of 0.6 million is primarily related to an increase of 0.5 million in payments to InvaGen, and 0.1 million in common stock issued to Fortress. 
 
 Interest Income 
 
 Interest income was 0.2 million and 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Loss on Settlement of Common Stock Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The loss on common stock warrant liabilities was 0.8 million and 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The new Series A common stock warrants, new Series B common stock warrants, new Series C common stock warrants and new Series D common stock warrants had a fair value of 0.8 million allocated to the liability classified warrants to purchase shares of our common stock originally issued in October 2022 and January 2023 at the time of issuance as a cost of inducement, which was recorded as a loss on settlement of common stock warrant liabilities. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 
 
 The change in fair value of warrant liabilities was a gain of 0.2 million and 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Warrants to purchase common stock that are required to be classified as a liability are valued at fair market value at each reporting period. The change in the fair value of warrant liabilities was primarily due to the modification of the exercise price as part of a warrant inducement, the exercise of warrants classified as liabilities, and fluctuation in our stock price. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 2.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from various public and private offerings of our common stock. We expect that our expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to execute on our product development plan and seek opportunities to license or acquire additional products. We will require additional financing to carry out our business plan and implement our strategy, and continue to analyze various alternatives, including potentially obtaining lines of credit, debt or equity financings, including through at-the-market program offerings, or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If we obtain funding through a strategic collaboration or licensing arrangement, we may be required to relinquish our rights to our product candidates or marketing territories. Without additional capital, we do not expect our cash will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements or allow us to fund our operating plan past the first half of 2025. We regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and various financing alternatives for opportunities to enhance our capital structure.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 
 With respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In the ordinary course of business, however, we may be subject to both insured and uninsured litigation. Suits and claims may be brought against us by customers, suppliers, partners and/or third parties (including tort claims for personal injury arising from clinical trials of our product candidates and property damage) alleging deficiencies in performance, breach of contract, etc., and seeking resulting alleged damages. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors
