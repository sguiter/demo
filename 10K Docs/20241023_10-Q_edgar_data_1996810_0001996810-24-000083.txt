FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS . The public communications and SEC filings of GE Vernova Inc. (the Company, GE Vernova, our, we or us) may contain statements related to future, not past, events. These forward-looking statements often address our current expected future business and financial performance and condition based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "see," "will," "would," "estimate," "forecast," "target," "preliminary," "range," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as the benefits we expect from our lean operating model, including cost and operational efficiencies and improvements; our expectations regarding the energy transition; the demand for our products and services, their role in the energy transition and our ability to meet those demands; our expectations of future increased business, revenues and operating results; our ability to innovate and anticipate and address customer demands; our ability to increase production capacity, efficiencies and quality; our underwriting and risk management; the experiences we believe we are gaining across our Haliade-X backlog related to installation timelines and related remediation plans; our ability to manage inflationary pressures; benefits we expect to receive from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA); our acquisitions and dispositions; our actual and planned investments, including in new product development, joint ventures and other collaborations with third parties; our ability to meet our sustainability goals and targets; our ability to deploy innovative technologies at scale; our restructuring program to reduce operational costs; our ability to novate or assign credit support provided by General Electric Company; litigation, arbitration and governmental proceedings involving us; the sufficiency and expected uses of our cash, liquidity, and financing arrangements; and our credit ratings. Any forward-looking statement in this report speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results, cash flows, or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: 
 
 Changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including risk of recession, inflation, supply chain constraints or disruptions, interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets, oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and exchange rates, and the impact of such changes and volatility on the Company s business operations, financial results and financial position; 
 Global economic trends, competition and geopolitical risks, including impacts from the ongoing geopolitical conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and conflict in the Middle East), demand or supply shocks from events such as a major terrorist attack, natural disasters, actual or threatened public health pandemics or other emergencies, or an escalation of sanctions, tariffs or other trade tensions, and related impacts on our supply chains and strategies; 
 Actual or perceived quality issues or product or safety failures related to our complex and specialized products, solutions, and services, the time required to address them, costs associated with related project delays, repairs or replacements, and the impact of any contractual claims for damages or other legal claims asserted in connection therewith, some of which may be for significant amounts, on our financial results, competitive position or reputation; 
 Market developments or customer actions that may affect our ability to achieve our anticipated operational cost savings and implement initiatives to control or reduce operating costs; 
 Significant disruptions in the Company s supply chain, including the high cost or unavailability of raw materials, components, and products essential to our business, and significant disruptions to our manufacturing and production facilities and distribution networks; 
 Our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel; 
 Our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and effectively enforce our intellectual property rights; 
 Our capital allocation plans, including the timing and amount of any dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, organic investments, and other priorities; 
 Downgrades of our credit ratings or ratings outlooks, or changes in rating application or methodology, and the related impact on the Company s funding profile, costs, liquidity and competitive position; 
 Shifts in market and other dynamics related to electrification, decarbonization or sustainability; 
 The amount and timing of our cash flows and earnings, which may be impacted by macroeconomic, customer, supplier, competitive, contractual and other dynamics and conditions; 
 Actions by our joint venture arrangements, consortiums, and similar collaborations with third parties for certain projects that result in additional costs and obligations; 
 Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy and energy transition innovation and technology; 
 Our ability to develop and introduce new technologies to meet market demand and evolving customer needs; 
 Our ability to obtain required permits, licenses, and registrations; 
 Changes in law, regulation or policy that may affect our businesses, such as trade policy and tariffs, regulation and incentives related to sustainability, climate change, environmental, health and safety laws, and tax law changes; 
 Our ability and challenges to manage the transition as a newly stand-alone public company or achieve some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from such transition; 
 The risk of an active trading market not being sustained for our securities or significant volatility in our stock price; and 
 The impact related to information technology, cybersecurity or data security breaches at GE Vernova or third parties. 
 
 These or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements, and these and other factors are more fully discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the Risk Factors and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections included in our information statement dated March 8, 2024, which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 8, 2024 (the Information Statement), as may be updated from time to time in our SEC filings and as posted on our website at www.gevernova.com/investors/fls. There may be other factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider to be immaterial that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement that we make. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements except as may be required by law or regulation.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD A) . The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The below discussion should be read alongside the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our audited combined financial statements and corresponding notes for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Information Statement. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions, except for per-share amounts which are presented in U.S. dollars. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Unless otherwise noted, statements related to changes in operating results relate to the corresponding period in the prior year. 
 
 In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and combined financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 

TRANSITION TO STAND-ALONE COMPANY 
 
 Financial Presentation Under GE Ownership. We completed our separation from General Electric Company (GE), which now operates as GE Aerospace, on April 2, 2024 (the Spin-Off). In connection with the Spin-Off, GE distributed all of the shares of our common stock to its shareholders and we became an independent company. Historically, as a business of GE, we relied on GE to manage certain of our operations and provide certain services, the costs of which were either allocated or directly billed to us. Accordingly, our historical costs for such services may not necessarily reflect the actual expenses we would have incurred, or will incur, as an independent company and may not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, stand-alone company during the historical periods presented. See Note 1 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. 
 
 Production Tax Credit Investments. Our Financial Services business offers a wide range of financial solutions to customers and projects that utilize our Power and Wind products and services. These solutions historically included making minority investments in projects, often through common or preferred equity investments where we generally seek to exit as soon as practicable once a project achieves commercial operation. Many such investments are in renewable energy U.S. tax equity vehicles that generate various tax credits, including production tax credits (PTCs), which can be used to offset an equity partner s tax liabilities in the U.S. and support the overall target return on investment. In connection with the Spin-Off, GE retained all renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments of 1.2 billion and any tax attributes from historical tax equity investing activity. We manage these investments under the Framework Investment Agreement with GE. Additionally, during the second quarter, in connection with GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments, we recognized a 0.1 billion benefit, recorded in Cost of equipment, related to deferred intercompany profit from historical equipment sales to the related investees. See Notes 11, 21 and 23 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. 

DISPOSITION ACTIVITY. During the second quarter of 2024, our Steam Power business completed the sale of part of its nuclear activities to Electricit de France S.A. (EDF). In connection with the disposition, we received net cash proceeds of 0.6 billion, which is subject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax gain of 0.9 billion recorded in Other income (expense) net in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). See Notes 3, 15, 16 and 19 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. 

2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 4 

ARBITRATION REFUND. In June 2024, we received 306 million in cash, which represented the return of cash payments we previously made relating to two partial withdrawal liability assessments issued by a multiemployer pension plan (Fund) to which we contribute, plus interest on such amounts. We challenged the assessments in arbitration, but under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), we were required to make monthly payments from May 2019 to September 2023 while the matter was arbitrated. In December 2023, an arbitrator ruled that we were exempt from the alleged liability, a decision that was appealed in January 2024 in a federal court. The arbitration award triggered a legal obligation for the Fund to return the payments to us with interest, which it did in June 2024. During the second quarter, 254 million of cash, constituting the payments previously made to the Fund, was recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expenses and 52 million of cash, constituting interest on such amounts, was recorded in Interest and other financial charges net in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). As this dispute is not yet resolved, we cannot predict its ultimate resolution, including whether we will retain the funds following all final appeals, whether we are entitled to additional interest, or whether the Fund may contend it is owed interest if it prevails. 

OFFSHORE WIND. On July 13, 2024, a wind turbine blade event occurred, related to a manufacturing deviation, at the Vineyard Wind offshore wind farm where we are the manufacturer and supplier of our newly developed Haliade-X 220m wind turbines (Haliade-X). On July 15, 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) issued a suspension order to cease power production and the installation of new wind turbines at the project site. On August 10, 2024, BSEE issued a superseding order allowing us to resume the installation of towers and nacelles, subject to certain conditions. On October 22, 2024, BSEE issued another superseding order allowing us to resume the installation of new blades, subject to certain conditions. In addition to the blade event at the Vineyard Wind offshore wind farm, there have been blade events related to commissioning and installation at the Dogger Bank offshore wind farm. 
 
 As we work through these issues, we are gaining experience across our Haliade-X backlog related to installation timelines including vessel availability, manufacturing and quality control processes, and various other project activities. Based on this experience, we are developing and implementing our remediation plans, which includes updates to our project timelines to account for the slower pace of execution. 
 
 As a result of the above, we have recorded incremental contract losses of approximately 0.7 billion during the third quarter which includes the impact of changes in execution timelines, costs to remediate quality issues, and estimates of project-related commercial liabilities. Additional changes or other developments could have an adverse effect on our cash collection timelines and contract margins and could result in further losses, which could be material. 
 
 In addition, on September 12, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding a project that was previously canceled by a customer resulting in a gain of approximately 0.3 billion in the quarter, which was recorded as 0.5 billion in revenues and 0.2 billion in cost of sales. The settlement included recovery of costs previously incurred on the canceled project. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Summary of Third Quarter 2024 Results . Remaining performance obligations (RPO) were 117.7 billion and 112.2 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues were 8.9 billion, an increase of 0.7 billion for the quarter. Net income (loss) was (0.1) billion, a decrease in net loss of 0.1 billion for the quarter, and net income (loss) margin was (1.1) . Diluted earnings (loss) per share was (0.35) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in diluted loss per share of 0.27 for the quarter. Cash flows from (used for) operating activities were 1.7 billion and (0.7) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA was 0.2 billion, an increase of less than 0.1 billion. Free cash flow was 1.1 billion and (1.2) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 RPO, a measure of backlog, includes unfilled firm and unconditional customer orders for equipment and services, excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. Services RPO includes the estimated life of contract sales related to long-term service agreements which remain unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period, excluding contracts that are not yet active. Services RPO also includes the estimated amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for time and material agreements, material services agreements, spare parts under purchase order, multi-year maintenance programs, and other services agreements, excluding any order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. See Note 9 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.

 As of September 30, 2024 , RPO increased 2.1 billion (2 from December 31, 2023, primarily at Electrification by 5.6 billion from orders outpacing revenues across all businesses; partially offset at Power, due to a reduction of approximately 3.9 billion related to the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF; and at Wind, related to decreases at Offshore Wind as we continue to execute on our contracts, and have finalized the settlement of a previously canceled project. RPO increased 5.6 billion (5 from September 30, 2023 primarily at Electrification by 6.3 billion as orders outpaced revenues across all businesses; partially offset at Power due to a reduction of approximately 3.9 billion related to the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF; and at Wind due to decreases at Offshore Wind where revenues outpaced new orders as we continue to execute on our contracts, as well as the cancellation of a project in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by Onshore Wind driven by a large order in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 REVENUES 2024 2023 2024 2023 Equipment revenues 5,290 4,869 13,101 12,746 Services revenues 3,623 3,383 11,276 10,448 Total revenues 8,913 8,253 24,376 23,194 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , total revenues increased 0.7 billion (8 ). Services revenues increased in all segments, primarily at Power due to growth in Gas Power from volume. Equipment revenues increased primarily at Electrification, led by growth at Grid Solutions; and at Power due to Gas Power from Heavy-Duty Gas Turbine shipments; partially offset at Wind, from Offshore Wind, where revenue decreased as a result of slower execution which was partially offset by revenue recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project, and Onshore Wind as more repower units were delivered in the period. 
 
 Organic revenues exclude the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency. Excluding these effects, organic revenues increased 0.8 billion (10 ), organic services revenues increased 0.3 billion (10 and organic equipment revenues increased 0.5 billion (10 ). Organic revenues increased at Power and Electrification. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , total revenues increased 1.2 billion (5 ). Services revenues increased in all segments, primarily at Power due to growth in Gas Power from higher outages and transactional service volume. Equipment revenues increased primarily at Electrification, led by growth at Grid Solutions; at Power from project commissioning and Aeroderivatives; partially offset at Wind, due to Onshore Wind where fewer units were delivered in the period, partially offset by higher equipment revenues at Offshore Wind as we continue to execute on our RPO and recorded revenue on the settlement of a previously canceled project. 
 
 Organic revenues exclude the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency. Excluding these effects, organic revenues increased 1.3 billion (6 ), organic services revenues increased 0.9 billion (9 and organic equipment revenues increased 0.4 billion (3 ). Organic revenues increased at Power and Electrification, partially offset by Wind. 
 
 Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 EARNINGS (LOSS) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating income (loss) (359) (307) (122) (1,118) Net income (loss) (99) (185) 1,075 (680) Net income (loss) attributable to GE Vernova (96) (170) 1,068 (635) Adjusted EBITDA 243 205 957 223 Diluted earnings (loss) per share(a) (0.35) (0.62) 3.85 (2.32) 
 (a)The computation of earnings (loss) per share for all periods through April 1, 2024 was calculated using 274 million common shares that were issued upon Spin-Off and excludes Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the Company participated in various GE stock-based compensation plans. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, there were no dilutive equity instruments as there were no equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to Spin-Off. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income (loss) was (0.4) billion, a 0.1 billion increase in operating loss, primarily due to: higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public company and separation costs; a decrease in segment results at Wind of 0.1 billion, due to incremental contract losses at Offshore Wind, partially offset by a gain recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project and increases at Onshore Wind; partially offset by an increase in segment results at Power of 0.2 billion, primarily at Gas Power and Steam Power services due to volume, productivity and price, which more than offset the impact of inflation; and at Electrification of 0.1 billion, primarily due to higher volume, price, and productivity at Grid Solutions. 
 
 Net income (loss) and Net income (loss) margin were (0.1) billion and (1.1) , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in net loss and net loss margin of 0.1 billion and 1.1 , respectively, for the quarter, primarily due to an increase in benefit for income taxes of 0.2 billion, partially offset by an increase in operating loss of 0.1 billion, and a decrease in other income (expense) of 0.1 billion. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were 0.2 billion and 2.7 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of less than 0.1 billion and 0.2 , respectively, primarily driven by increases in segment results at Power and Electrification, partially offset at Wind. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income (loss) was (0.1) billion, a 1.0 billion decrease in operating loss, primarily due to: an increase in segment results at Power of 0.5 billion, primarily attributable to Gas Power, where higher volume, favorable pricing, and increased productivity more than offset the impact of inflation; at Electrification of 0.3 billion, primarily due to higher volume, price, and productivity at Grid Solutions; at Wind of 0.1 billion, primarily at Onshore Wind as a result of improved pricing and the impact of cost reduction activities, which was partially offset by a decrease at Offshore Wind as a result of incremental contract losses in the third quarter, partially offset by a gain recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project; as well as 0.3 billion received related to an arbitration refund and a 0.1 billion benefit related to deferred intercompany profit that was recognized upon GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments in connection with the Spin-Off in the second quarter; partially offset by higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public company and separation costs. 
 
 Net income (loss) and Net income (loss) margin were 1.1 billion and 4.4 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.8 billion and 7.3 , respectively, for the period, primarily due to a decrease in operating loss of 1.0 billion and an increase in other income of 0.7 billion, driven by a 0.9 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF, partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of 0.1 billion.

POWER . We believe gas power plays a critical role in the energy transition, offering a fundamental foundation of reliable and dispatchable power. Although market factors related to the energy transition, such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related legislation and policies continue to evolve, we expect the gas power market to grow over the next decade. We foresee gas power generation continuing to grow low single digits, which will play an indispensable role in ensuring grid stability and energy security. We remain focused on our underwriting discipline and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles, where we have high confidence in delivering for our customers. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, GE Vernova's gas turbine utilization was flat compared to the same period last year. Growth in Asia from fewer outages and more HA units commissioned, and higher utilization in the U.S. were offset by Europe where increased nuclear, hydro, and renewable energy drove lower gas operations in the quarter. Global electricity demand increased by low-single digits. 
 
 As we work in emerging markets, there could be uncertainty in the timing of deal closures due to financing and other complexities. Power has proactively managed the impact of inflationary pressure by deploying lean initiatives to drive cost productivity measures, collaborating with our suppliers and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. Given the long-cycle nature of the business, we expect the impact of inflation will continue to be challenging and we will continue to take actions to manage it. We are adjusting pricing of our products and services based on demand, inflation, and industry dynamics. 
 
 We continue to invest in new product development. In Nuclear Power, we have an agreement with a customer for the deployment of small modular nuclear reactor technology, the first commercial contract in North America, with the potential to enable reductions in nuclear power plant costs and cycle times. In Gas Power, we continue to invest for the long-term, including decarbonization technologies that will provide customers with lower carbon-emitting and more reliable power. As of September 30, 2024, our fundamentals remained strong with approximately 71.3 billion in RPO and a gas turbine installed base of approximately 7,000 units with approximately 1,700 units under long-term service agreements with an average remaining contract life of approximately 10 years. As of September 30, 2024, we had 36 HA-Turbines in RPO, 31 being installed and commissioned, and 106 HA-Turbines in our installed base with approximately 2.7 million operating hours.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, segment revenues were up 0.3 billion (8 and segment EBITDA was up 0.2 billion (78 ). 
 
 Segment revenues increased 0.5 billion (13 organically , primarily due to increases in Gas Power services volume and Gas Power equipment from Heavy-Duty Gas Turbine shipments. 
 
 Segment EBITDA increased 0.1 billion (45 organically , primarily due to increases at Gas Power and Steam Power services, where volume, productivity, and price more than offset the impact of inflation. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, segment revenues were up 0.9 billion (7 and segment EBITDA was up 0.5 billion (58 ). 
 
 Segment revenues increased 1.0 billion (9 organically , primarily at Gas Power services driven by higher outages and transactional volume and increases in Gas Power equipment from project commissioning and Aeroderivatives. 
 
 Segment EBITDA increased 0.4 billion (39 organically , mainly driven by improvements at Gas Power where higher volume, favorable pricing, and increased productivity offset the impact of inflation. 

WIND . In our Wind segment, we create value by engineering, manufacturing, and commercializing wind turbines, an important technology playing a role in the energy transition as we seek to decarbonize the world's energy sector. As we focus on providing carbon-free electricity reliably and at scale, we have simplified our senior management structure and portfolio of product offerings, focusing on fewer and more reliable workhorse products. Workhorse products, which include our 2.8-127m, 3.6-154m, and 6.1-158m onshore units, and our Haliade-X 220m offshore units, account for approximately 70 of our equipment RPO in Onshore Wind and Offshore Wind at September 30, 2024. Included in our RPO are services agreements on approximately 24,000 of our onshore wind turbines, from an installed base of approximately 56,000 units. 
 
 At Onshore Wind, we are focused on improving our overall fleet availability. We are reducing product variants and deploying repairs and other corrective measures across the fleet. Concurrently, we intend to operate in fewer geographies and focus on those geographic regions that align better with our products and supply chain footprint, positioning our workhorse products to targeted countries. Our volume mix has shifted towards the U.S., currently representing approximately 75 of Onshore Wind's equipment RPO, while our international volume has become smaller and more profitable. Specifically in the U.S., the IRA introduced new, and extended existing, tax incentives through at least 2033, significantly improving project economics for our customers and turbine producers. Our projects in the U.S. generally benefit from incentives available to our customers and broadly available IRA incentives. Finally, we are continuing our restructuring program to reduce our operating costs and are seeing the benefits both operationally and financially. 
 
 In our Offshore Wind business, we continue to experience pressure related to our product and project costs, and execution timelines, as we deliver on our existing backlog. We are committed to driving quality improvements, installation efficiencies, and cost productivity, including steps to right-size the business.

ELECTRIFICATION . We continue to experience robust demand for our systems, equipment, and services across all businesses. Demand remains strong for large scale transmission-related equipment to interconnect renewables and move bulk power. We also continue to benefit from higher growth in orders from other transmission activities within our Grid Solutions business. 
 
 Our Grid Solutions business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs globally. We participate in the onshore interconnection market and the rapidly growing offshore renewable interconnection market with new products and technology supporting a 2 GW HVDC solution standard. We have developed and seek to continue developing new technologies, such as grid-forming static synchronous compensators and SF 6 -free switchgears, with the intention of solving for a denser, more resilient, stable, and efficient electric grid with lower future greenhouse gas emissions.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit was 1.1 billion and 1.1 billion for the three months ended and 4.0 billion and 3.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross margin was 12.4 and 12.7 for the three months ended and 16.3 and 13.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was due to an increase at Power due to Gas Power services from favorable volume, productivity, and price, which more than offset inflation; an increase at Electrification due to higher volume, price, and productivity at Grid Solutions; partially offset by a decrease at Wind, as a result of Offshore Wind incremental contract losses, partially offset by a gain recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project and an increase in Onshore Wind through improved pricing. The increase in gross profit for the year was due to increases at Power and Electrification, due to the reasons described above, and at Wind, due to Onshore Wind through improved pricing and the impact of cost reduction activities, and a gain recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project at Offshore Wind, partially offset by incremental contract losses at Offshore Wind. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative. Selling, general, and administrative costs were 1.2 billion and 1.1 billion for the three months ended and 3.4 billion and 3.6 billion for the nine months ended and comprised 13.8 and 13.8 of revenues for the three months ended and 13.8 and 15.5 of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in costs for the quarter was attributable to labor inflation, higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public company, and separation costs, which more than offset cost reduction initiatives. The reduction in costs for the year was attributable to a 0.3 billion arbitration refund received in the second quarter of 2024, and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public company and separation costs.

Restructuring Charges and Separation Costs. We continuously evaluate our cost structure and are implementing several restructuring and process transformation actions considered necessary to simplify our organizational structure. In addition, in connection with the Spin-Off, we incurred and will continue to incur certain one-time separation costs and recognized a benefit related to deferred intercompany profit upon GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments. See Note 23 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. 
 
 Interest and Other Financial Charges Net. Interest and other financial charges net was less than 0.1 billion and 0.1 billion in income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and less than 0.1 billion and 0.1 billion in expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The higher income in 2024 was primarily driven by a higher average balance of invested funds interest received from an arbitration refund during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary components of net interest and other financial charges are fees on cash management activities, interest on borrowings, and interest earned on cash balances and short-term investments. 
 
 Income Taxes. We recorded an income tax benefit on a pre-tax loss with an effective tax rate of 18.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a portion of the pre-tax loss providing no tax benefit in certain jurisdictions. 
 
 We recorded an income tax expense on pre-tax income with an effective tax rate of 22.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to losses providing no tax benefit in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by a pre-tax gain with an insignificant tax impact from the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF. 
 
 We recorded an income tax expense on a pre-tax loss in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to taxes in profitable jurisdictions and losses providing no tax benefit in other jurisdictions. 
 
 See Note 15 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY. Historically, we participated in cash pooling and other financing arrangements with GE to manage liquidity and fund our operations. As a result of completing the Spin-Off, we no longer participate in these arrangements and our Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held and used solely for our own operations. Our capital structure, long-term commitments, and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical practices. In connection with the Spin-Off, we received cash from GE of 0.8 billion through a cash contribution of 0.5 billion to fund future GE Vernova operations and a cash transfer of 0.3 billion restricted in connection with certain legal matters associated with legacy GE operations, such that our cash balance on the date of the completion of the Spin-Off was approximately 4.2 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was 7.4 billion, approximately 1.4 billion of which was held in countries where access to cash may be delayed due to various regulations (including 0.1 billion in Russia and Ukraine) and 0.5 billion was restricted use cash. During the third quarter of 2024, we received proceeds of 0.7 billion from the sale of a portion of our equity interest in GE Vernova T D India Ltd (formerly known as GE T D India Ltd). During the second quarter of 2024, our Steam Power business completed the sale of part of its nuclear activities to EDF. In connection with the disposition, we received net cash proceeds of 0.6 billion. During the second quarter of 2024, we also received a cash refund of 0.3 billion in connection with an arbitration proceeding. In addition, we have access to a 3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility). See Capital Resources and Liquidity Debt below for additional information. We believe our future cash flows generated from operations and committed credit facility will be responsive to the needs of our current and planned operations for at least the next 12 months. 

Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows. The most significant source of cash flows from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating uses of cash are to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and postretirement plans. We measure ourselves on a free cash flow basis. We believe that free cash flow provides management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis. Free cash flow also provides insight into our ability to produce cash subsequent to fulfilling our capital obligations; however, free cash flow does not delineate funds available for discretionary uses as it does not deduct the payments required for certain investing and financing activities. 
 
 We typically invest in property, plant, and equipment (PP E) over multiple periods to support new product introductions and increases in manufacturing capacity and to perform ongoing maintenance of our manufacturing operations. We believe that while PP E expenditures will fluctuate period to period, we will need to maintain a material level of net PP E spend to maintain ongoing operations and growth of the business.

Cash from (used for) operating activities was 1.7 billion and (0.7) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash from (used for) operating activities increased by 2.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by: higher net income (after adjusting for depreciation of PP E, amortization of intangible assets, and (gains) losses on purchases and sales of business interests) of 1.3 billion, including the impact of a 0.3 billion cash refund we received in connection with an arbitration proceeding in the second quarter of 2024; an increase of 1.2 billion in accounts payable and equipment project payables, primarily due to lower disbursements, including reductions in prepayments; and an increase of 0.7 billion in contract liabilities and current deferred income, due to higher collections at Electrification and Power, and lower liquidations, including the settlement of a previously canceled project in 2024, at Wind; partially offset by a decrease in due to related parties of (0.5) billion, primarily due to settlements of payables with GE prior to the Spin-Off in 2024. 
 
 Cash from operating activities of 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a 0.9 billion inflow from changes in working capital. The cash inflow from changes in working capital was primarily driven by: contract liabilities and current deferred income of 1.7 billion, driven by down payments and collections on several large projects in Grid Solutions at Electrification, and net collections at Power, partially offset by liquidations and the settlement of a previously canceled project at Wind; accounts payable and equipment project payables of 1.0 billion, due to material purchases outpacing disbursements, and reductions in prepayments; inventories of (1.2) billion, primarily in Gas Power, to support fulfillment and deliveries expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in 2025; changes in due to related parties of (0.4) billion, primarily due to settlements of payables with GE prior to the Spin-Off; and current contract assets of (0.2) billion, driven by revenue recognition exceeding billings on our equipment and other service agreements in Electrification and Power. 
 
 Cash used for operating activities of 0.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a less than 0.1 billion outflow from changes in working capital. The cash outflow from changes in working capital was primarily driven by: inventories of (1.1) billion, primarily due to inventory build in Gas Power at Power; a decrease in accounts payable and equipment project payables of (0.2) billion, driven by higher disbursements in Onshore Wind at Wind; contract liabilities and current deferred income of 1.0 billion as a result of project collections and down payments in Power and Electrification outpacing revenue recognition, partially offset by lower collections and higher revenue recognition in Wind; and current receivables of 0.2 billion, driven by collections outpacing billings primarily in Power and Wind. 
 
 Cash from (used for) investing activities was 0.1 billion and (0.5) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cash from (used for) investing activities increased by 0.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by: net proceeds from principal business dispositions of 0.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024, as a result of our Steam Power business sale of part of its nuclear activities to EDF in our Power segment; and the nonrecurrence of the net impact of our acquisition of Nexus Controls and other investment sales of 0.2 billion in 2023; partially offset by a decrease in sales of and distributions from equity method investments of (0.2) billion, primarily driven by our Financial Services business. Cash used for additions to PP E and internal-use software, which is a component of free cash flow , was 0.5 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Cash from financing activities was 3.5 billion and 0.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash from financing activities increased by 2.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by: higher transfers from parent of 2.3 billion; and proceeds from the sale of an approximately 16 equity interest in GE Vernova T D India Ltd, a power transmission and distribution solution provider, of 0.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, which is reflected in All other financing activities. After the sale, we retained a controlling interest in GE Vernova T D India Ltd. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements. In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that oblige us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under lease and guarantee arrangements as well as our investment commitments is provided in Note 7 and Note 22 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in Note 7 and Note 20 in the Notes to the audited combined financial statements included in the Information Statement. Additionally, we have material cash requirements related to our pension obligations as described in Note 13 to the audited combined financial statements included in the Information Statement. 
 
 Debt. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 0.1 billion of total debt, excluding finance leases. We have a 3.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility to fund near-term intra-quarter working capital needs as they arise. In addition, we have a 3.0 billion committed trade finance facility (Trade Finance Facility, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities). The Trade Finance Facility has not been and is not expected to be utilized, and does not contribute to direct liquidity. We believe that our financing arrangements, future cash from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our future cash flow needs. For more information about these Credit Facilities, refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024. 
 
 Credit Ratings and Conditions. GE historically relied on the debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of its operations. We may continue to rely on capital markets in the future, and we have access to the Revolving Credit Facility to fund operations, as described above, to further support our liquidity needs. The cost and availability of any debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings and market conditions. Standard and Poor's Global Ratings (S P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) have issued credit ratings for our Company. Our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the following table. 
 
 S P Fitch Outlook Stable Stable Long term BBB- BBB 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 12 

We are disclosing our credit ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to credit. Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. For a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see the Risks Relating to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters section of Risk Factors in the Information Statement. 
 
 If GE Vernova is unable to maintain investment grade ratings, we could face significant challenges in being awarded new contracts, substantially increasing financing and hedging costs, and refinancing risks as well as substantially decreasing the availability of credit. The estimated liquidity impact in the event of a downgrade below investment grade was immaterial as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. These exposures are managed and mitigated with the use of financial instruments, including derivatives contracts. We apply policies to manage these risks, including prohibitions on speculative trading activities. As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such principal currencies include the euro, the British pound sterling, the Brazilian real, and the Indian rupee. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were less than 0.1 billion and (0.1) billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were (0.1) billion and (0.2) billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See Note 20 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. For more information about foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and commodity risk see the "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk" section of the Information Statement. 
 
 Parent Company Credit Support. To support GE Vernova in selling products and services globally, GE often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the performance of its subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-customer related activities of GE Vernova (collectively, the GE credit support). In connection with the Spin-Off, we are working to seek novation or assignment of GE credit support, the majority of which relates to parent company guarantees, associated with GE Vernova legal entities from GE to GE Vernova. For GE credit support that remained outstanding at the Spin-Off, GE Vernova is obligated to use reasonable best efforts to terminate or replace, and obtain a full release of GE s obligations and liabilities under, all such credit support. Beginning in 2025, GE Vernova will pay a quarterly fee to GE based on amounts related to the GE credit support. GE Vernova will face other contractual restrictions and requirements while GE continues to be obligated under such credit support on behalf of GE Vernova. While GE will remain obligated under the contract or instrument, GE Vernova will be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support related payments that GE is required to make. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we estimated GE Vernova RPO and other obligations that relate to GE credit support to be approximately 21 billion, an over 60 reduction since year end and over 40 reduction since the Spin-Off, of which approximately 1 billion are financial guarantees. We expect approximately 12 billion of the RPO related to GE credit support obligations to contractually mature within five years from the date of the Spin-Off and credit support on financial guarantees to not exceed a year beyond separation. The underlying obligations are predominantly customer contracts that GE Vernova performs in the normal course of its business. We have no known instances historically where payments or performance from GE were required under parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova customer contracts. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In November of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The amendments are intended to increase reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We have evaluated the impact of this guidance and do not expect a significant impact to our financial statements. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The amendments require disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and further disaggregation of income taxes paid for individually significant jurisdictions. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures within our consolidated and combined financial statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES . To prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (i) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (ii) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 2 to the audited combined financial statements included in the Information Statement for additional discussion of accounting policies and critical accounting estimates. 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES . The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are supplemental measures of our performance and our liquidity that we believe help investors understand our financial condition and operating results and assess our future prospects. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, are important supplemental measures that exclude non-cash or other items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and the overall health of our company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allow investors to see our results through the eyes of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. When read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses and can be used by management as one basis for financial, operational, and planning decisions. Finally, these measures are often used by analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. 
 2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 13 

Management recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes, thereby affecting their comparability from company to company. In order to compensate for these and the other limitations discussed below, management does not consider these measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers should review the reconciliations below, and above with respect to free cash flow, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures follow. 
 
 We believe the organic measures presented below provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency, which includes translational and transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends.

 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin , which are adjusted to exclude the effects of unique and/or non-cash items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations, provide management and investors with meaningful measures of our performance that increase the period-to-period comparability by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors. We believe Adjusted organic EBITDA and Adjusted organic EBITDA margin provide management and investors with, when considered with Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin , a more complete understanding of underlying operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by further excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency, which includes translational and transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends. 
 
 We believe these measures provide additional insight into how our businesses are performing on a normalized basis. However, Adjusted EBITDA , Adjusted organic EBITDA , Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted organic EBITDA margin should not be construed as inferring that our future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measures adjust.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and concluded that (i) our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, and (ii) no change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Prior to April 2, 2024, GE Vernova relied on certain business processes and internal controls over financial reporting performed by GE. In connection with the Spin-Off, responsibility for these processes and internal controls were transferred from GE to GE Vernova personnel, including internal controls and processes related to information technology, treasury, human resources (including payroll and benefit plan administration), taxes, external financial reporting, legal, and oversight functions such as corporate governance. The Company has revised and adopted policies, procedures, and processes, as needed, to meet regulatory requirements applicable to a standalone public company and will continue to identify, document, and evaluate key controls to provide reasonable assurance that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. We are reporting the following matter in compliance with SEC requirements to disclose administrative proceedings arising under laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment where a governmental authority is a party and that involve potential monetary sanctions of 300,000 or greater. In March 2024, one of our Australian subsidiaries received notice from the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) of its intention to issue infringement notices imposing administrative fines on the subsidiary for importing equipment containing SF 6 gas without an equipment license, as required by local law related to synthetic greenhouse gas management and seek a court order to impose civil penalties for delinquent reporting under such law. The applicable local law regulates the import to Australia of synthetic greenhouse gases in equipment, including certain of our switchgear products, and our subsidiary had neglected to renew the import license required under the law. We responded to DCCEEW, and following discussions with the agency, paid approximately 0.3 million in fines in connection with the infringement notices during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Discussions with DCCEEW regarding a court-issued civil penalty order are pending and we expect additional fines associated with such order may be more than 300,000. Refer to Legal Matters in Note 22 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information relating to legal matters.

 We recorded an income tax expense on pre-tax income with an effective tax rate of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily due to losses providing no tax benefit in certain jurisdictions, partially offset by a pre-tax gain with an insignificant tax impact from the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF.

 The OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15 of reported profits (Pillar 2) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. During 2023, many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar 2 model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar 2 slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar 2. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate the potential consequences of Pillar 2 on our longer-term financial position. In 2024, we expect to incur insignificant tax expenses in connection with Pillar 2.

 Derivatives and Hedging. Our primary objective in executing and holding derivatives is to reduce the earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices over the terms of our customer contracts. These hedge contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price movements. The Company does not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. 
 
 We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. These contracts are generally one to in duration but with maximum remaining maturities of up to years as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges. The total amount in AOCI related to cash flow hedges was a net million gain as of September 30, 2024, of which a net gain of million related to our share of AOCI recognized at our non-consolidated joint ventures.

The total amount in AOCI related to net investment hedges was a net gain of million as of September 30, 2024.

Of these investments, million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were owned by our Financial Services business. At December 31, 2023, these investments were substantially all related to renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments that were subsequently retained by GE in connection with the Spin-Off. See Note 11 for further information. Our maximum exposure to loss in respect of unconsolidated VIEs is increased by our commitments to make additional investments in these entities described in Note 22.

 Guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, we were committed under the following guarantee arrangements: 
 
 Credit support. We have provided million of credit support on behalf of certain customers or associated companies, predominantly joint ventures and partnerships, using arrangements such as standby letters of credit and performance guarantees, and a line of credit to support our consolidated subsidiaries. The liability for such credit support was million. In addition, prior to the Spin-Off, GE provided parent company guarantees to GE Vernova in certain jurisdictions. See Note 24 for further information. 
 
 Indemnification agreements. We have million of indemnification commitments, including obligations arising from the Spin-Off, our commercial contracts, and agreements governing the sale of business assets, for which we recorded a liability of million. The liability is primarily associated with cash and deposits, of which million relates to cash transferred to the Company from GE as part of the Spin-Off that is restricted in connection with certain legal matters related to legacy GE operations. The liability reflects the use of these funds to settle any associated obligations and the return of any remaining cash to GE in a future reporting period once resolved. In addition, the liability includes million of indemnifications in connection with agreements entered into with GE related to the Spin-Off, including the Tax Matters Agreement. 
 
 Product Warranties. We provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information, mostly historical claims experience, claims costs may differ from amounts provided. The liability for product warranties was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 34 

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy business practices that were the subject of cases in various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments in the pre-acquisition period as the source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and compliance activity related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will ultimately be consistent with the estimated liability established. The estimation of this liability may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are unable to develop a meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this estimated liability. Factors that can affect the ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include formulas for determining disgorgement, fines and/or penalties, the duration and amount of legal and investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax consequences of any settlements or previous deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and related matters could exceed the amount provided. 
 
 In June 2024, we executed a settlement agreement with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by The Ministry of Energy (MOE) in connection with certain Alstom steam power construction projects with Saudi Electric Company (SE) won between 1998 and 2008. In November 2015, prior to its acquisition by GE, Alstom had paid a fine and pled guilty to charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including in relation to conduct related to of these SE steam power projects. In December 2015, following the acquisition of Alstom by GE, SE contacted GE seeking recompense for alleged reputational damage and in December 2021, the Saudi Arabia National Anti-Corruption Commission became involved and initiated an investigation. The settlement of approximately million consists of million in cash payments to the MOE and the remainder as a credit note to SE, and releases GE Vernova, GE and their respective affiliates from civil and criminal liabilities related to this matter after the settlement obligations are met. Approximately million of the cash settlement was paid in the second quarter and the remainder will be payable through September 2026. 
 
 Environmental and Asset Retirement Obligations. Our operations involve the use, disposal, and cleanup of substances regulated under environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental remediation activities and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning, and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries. 
 
 It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology, and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Our reserves related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims recorded in All other liabilities were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 We record asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the obligation is incurred and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. These obligations primarily represent nuclear decommissioning, legal obligations to return leased premises to their initial state, or dismantle and repair specific alterations for certain leased sites. The liability is measured at the present value of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the asset s useful life.

In addition to the continued impacts of ongoing initiatives, restructuring primarily included exit activities associated with previously announced plans across our Wind businesses, primarily reflecting the selectivity strategy to operate in fewer markets and to simplify and standardize product variants. The estimated cost of this multi-year restructuring program was approximately million, with the majority recognized in 2023. This plan was expanded during the third quarter of 2023 to include the consolidation of the global footprint and related resources at our Power businesses to better serve our customers. In the third quarter of 2024, in order to transform and optimize our global footprint, we announced the restructuring of our Hydro Power business, as a result we recognized million of charges, which primarily relates to a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of property, plant and equipment. See Note 6 for further information.

These amounts have been recorded in Due to related parties on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position. 
 
 Financial Services Investments. Our Financial Services business invests in project infrastructure entities where we do not hold a controlling financial interest.

Revenues for sales to these entities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were t significant as GE retained the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments. See Note 11 for further information. 
 
 Corporate Allocations. Prior to the Spin-Off, GE historically provided the Company with significant corporate, infrastructure, and shared services. Some of these services continue to be provided by GE to the Company on a temporary basis following the Spin-Off under the Transition Services Agreement. Accordingly, for periods prior to the Spin-Off, certain GE corporate costs have been charged to the Company based on allocation methodologies as follows: 
 
 2024 3Q FORM 10-Q 36 

million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were recorded in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). Costs allocated to the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were t significant as GE Vernova had established standalone capabilities for such services. 
 b. Information technology, finance, insurance, research, supply chain, human resources, tax, and facilities activities were charged to the Company based on headcount, revenue, or other allocation methodologies. Costs for these services of million and million were charged to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Costs for these services of million were charged to the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Such costs are primarily included in Selling, general, and administrative expenses and Research and development expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). 
 c. Costs associated with employee medical insurance totaling million and million were charged for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Costs associated with employee medical insurance totaling million were charged to the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Costs were charged to the Company based on employee headcount and are recorded in Cost of equipment, Cost of services, Selling, general, and administrative expenses, or Research and development expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss) based on the employee population. 
 
 Additionally, GE granted various employee benefits to its employees, including prior to the Spin-Off to those of the Company, under the GE Long-Term Incentive Plan. These benefits primarily included stock options and restricted stock units. Compensation expense associated with this plan was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Compensation expense associated with this plan was million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Such expense is included primarily in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). These costs were charged directly to the Company based on the specific employees receiving awards. 
 
 Finally, while GE s third-party debt had not been attributed to the Company, GE allocated a portion of interest expense related to its third-party debt for funding provided by GE to the Company for certain investments held by Financial Services. The interest was allocated based on the GE-funded ending net investment position each reporting period. Interest allocated was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest allocated was million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Such expense is included in Interest and other financial charges net in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). 
 
 Management believes that the expense and cost allocations were determined on a basis that is a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by the Company. The amounts that would have been, or will be incurred, on a stand-alone basis could materially differ from the amounts allocated due to economies of scale, difference in management judgment, a requirement for more or fewer employees, or other factors. Management does not believe, however, that it is practicable to estimate what these expenses would have been had the Company operated as an independent entity, including any expenses associated with obtaining any of these services from unaffiliated entities. In addition, the future results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could differ materially from the historical results presented herein. 
 
 Parent Company Credit Support. GE provided the Company with parent credit support in certain jurisdictions. To support the Company in selling products and services globally, GE often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the performance of what were subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for some non-customer related activities of GE Vernova. There are no known instances historically where payments or performance from GE were required under parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova customer contracts. 
 
 million and million for the three months ended and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the first quarter of 2024, we received cash of million from GE for credits generated since the credits became available in 2023.
