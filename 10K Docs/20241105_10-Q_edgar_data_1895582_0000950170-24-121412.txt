PERSHING SQUARE SPARC HOLDINGS, LTD. 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 in the State of Delaware and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other business combination transaction with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. The Company s registration statement (the Prospectus for the distribution of up to subscription warrants (the SPARs ), each exercisable for Public Shares (defined below) at a minimum exercise price of per share, was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on September 29, 2023 (the Registration and the distribution was effective as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded the full amount of SPARs, as issued and owned, with Continental Stock Transfer Trust, as the SPAR rights agent (the Rights Agent for the benefit of the Depository Trust Company DTC participants and registered owners of PSTH (defined below). The Rights Agent verified the SPARs position at each DTC participant or registered owner, and the SPAR register currently presents SPARs as issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects that the number of SPARs issued may vary from period to period by amounts that are not expected to be material, particularly in respect of SPARs voluntarily abandoned and forfeited in connection with the business liquidation of holders from time to time. The common shares of the surviving entity of the Business Combination, which, depending on the form the Business Combination takes, may be the Company or any entity other than the Company (the Surviving Corporation ), are referred to as the Public Shares . Since the Company s inception, all activity relates to the Company s formation, the Registration and the search for a Business Combination from and after effectiveness of the Registration. The Company may generate non-operating income in the form of interest from proceeds obtained in connection with the private placements of the Sponsor Shares and the Sponsor Warrants (defined in Note 4). The Company has selected December 31st as its fiscal year-end. The Company s sponsor is Pershing Square SPARC Sponsor, LLC Sponsor ), a Delaware limited liability company organized on November 4, 2021. The Sponsor is an affiliate of Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. PSCM ), a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Sponsor is wholly owned by Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd., a Guernsey company, Pershing Square, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Pershing Square International, Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company, each of which is an investment fund managed by PSCM (collectively the Pershing Square Funds ). The Sponsor is also an affiliate of Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. PSTH ), a Delaware corporation, which was a special purpose acquisition company SPAC that did not enter into an initial business combination within the prescribed time period and redeemed all of its Class A common stock and subsequently dissolved. Board of Directors, Committees of the Board Advisory Board The Company s board of directors (the Board is comprised of Mr. William A. Ackman, Dr. Jennifer Blouin, Ms. Kathryn Judge and Ms. Linda Rottenberg. All directors other than Mr. Ackman are independent and were appointed on September 29, 2023. Mr. Ackman is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating and Governance Committee. The committees are comprised solely of the independent directors of the Company. The Board also established an Advisory Board which is comprised of Ms. Lisa Gersh, Mr. Michael Ovitz and Ms. Jacqueline Dawn Reses.

Public Shares, and SPARs must be exercised in whole. Upon the Company entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a Business Combination (a Definitive Agreement ), the Company will announce the final exercise price (the Final Exercise Price of the SPARs. Following entry into the Definitive Agreement, the Company will file a registration statement (the Business Combination Registration Statement that will include information regarding the proposed Business Combination, and the Company will seek to satisfy substantially all express closing conditions contained in the Definitive Agreement, other than those that can only be satisfied as of a later date (the Disclosure Period Closing Conditions ). Following the satisfaction or waiver of the Disclosure Period Closing Conditions and the Business Combination Registration Statement becoming effective and being mailed to the holders of SPARs, holders will have business days (the SPAR Holder Election Period to submit an irrevocable notice of their election to purchase Public Shares (an Election ), and to submit their exercise payment to be held in a custodial account controlled by an independent custodian (the Custodial Account ). Following the SPAR Holder Election Period, the Company will have up to business days (the Closing Period to assess whether all remaining closing conditions are satisfied (the Final Closing Conditions and whether to proceed with the proposed Business Combination, abandon the Business Combination, or in certain limited circumstances, extend the Closing Period to a date that is no later than months from the start of the SPAR Holder Election Period. If the Final Closing Conditions are satisfied, the Business Combination will be consummated (the Closing and the SPARs will automatically be exercised concurrently therewith. In certain circumstances, Elections may be revoked, and the periods may be postponed, extended or terminated, as described in the Prospectus. The Company will finance the Business Combination with proceeds from the exercise of the SPARs, a minimum of if all SPARs issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 are exercised, and from the proceeds of the Forward Purchase Shares (defined in Note 4). The proceeds from private placement sales to the Sponsor of shares of common stock at per share (the Common Stock ), for an aggregate purchase price of (the Sponsor Shares and the Sponsor Warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of , will be used to fund operating expenses, with any remaining amount to be used in connection with the Business Combination. The Sponsor Shares will be identical to the Public Shares, except that they will be subject to certain transfer restrictions and have certain registration rights. Segregated Account Of the total proceeds from the sale of the Sponsor Shares and Sponsor Warrants, was deposited in a segregated account (the Segregated Account to be held as cash and will not be released until the earlier of the Closing or the Company s liquidation. The remainder of the proceeds were placed in the Company s operating account and held as unrestricted cash to pay for ongoing expenses (such as business, legal, accounting, and due diligence costs related to prospective acquisitions, and continuing general and administrative expenses). Custodial Account The funds received in connection with the submission of Elections will be held in a Custodial Account and will be held in cash or, at the election of the Company, invested solely in U.S. Treasury obligations (which are United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2 (a) (16) of the Investment Company Act) having a maturity of one hundred eighty days or less or in money market funds that meet certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Company expects to make and announce the decision to hold the funds in cash, or such U.S. Treasury obligations or money market funds, in the Business Combination Registration Statement, based on market, legal and other factors at such time, including (i) the relative interest rates for cash accounts and such other instruments, (ii) then-existing market practice and legal and regulatory considerations with respect to custodial accounts for SPACs and other similar vehicles (including whether holding the funds in such U.S. Treasury obligations or money market funds would require the Company to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act), (iii) the willingness of banks and other depositary institutions to hold large sums in cash in light of their regulatory and business requirements, and (iv) the Company s assessment of the credit profile of any such bank or other depositary institution willing to hold a cash account.

from the start of the SPAR Holder Election Period) (an Early Termination in which event the funds held in the Custodial Account are to be returned, inclusive of interest (if any), to electing holders of the SPARs in proportion to the aggregate exercise price paid by each such holder. In no event will funds be held in the Custodial Account for longer than months from the start of the SPAR Holder Election Period, which is the maximum amount of time funds may be held in the Custodial Account, and at which time the Company will be required to liquidate if the Closing has not yet occurred. In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, all amounts held in the Custodial Account will be released to the Company. The Company will use these funds to pay all or a portion of the consideration payable to the target or owners of the target of the Business Combination and to pay other expenses associated with the Business Combination. If the Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt instruments, or not all of the funds released from the Custodial Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with the Business Combination, the Company may apply the balance of the cash released to the Company from the Custodial Account for general corporate purposes, including maintenance or expansion of operations of post-combination businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing the Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or make other investments, or for working capital. The proceeds deposited in the Custodial Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of holders of the Public Shares. Business Combination The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the sale of the Sponsor Shares and Sponsor Warrants and from the exercise under the Forward Purchase Agreements (defined in Note 4), although substantially all proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward operating expenses in connection with identifying and consummating a Business Combination. The Company will enter into a Business Combination with a target business having a value of at least of the aggregate proceeds from the exercise of all SPARs at the Final Exercise Price, and intends to enter into a Business Combination with a target business of greater value than the proceeds available from the exercise of the SPARs. The Company may not enter into a Business Combination with another blank check or similar company. Subject to these restrictions, management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. The Business Combination may be structured in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, or reorganization and will be structured so that the Company is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. The Company will comply with applicable requirements under Delaware law and, if and as applicable, the rules of the OTCQX marketplace of the OTC Markets Group. The Company will obtain any required stockholder approvals following the effectiveness of the Business Combination Registration Statement, at which time the Sponsor, as owner of the Sponsor Shares, will be the Company s sole stockholder. Accordingly, the holders of SPARs will not have the opportunity to vote in favor of or against the proposed Business Combination or on any other matter submitted to a vote of stockholders. If the holders of the SPARs disapprove of the proposed transaction, their recourse will be limited to selling or choosing not to exercise their SPARs. The SPARs will expire upon the earlier of (i) an Early Termination, (ii) Closing and (iii) . If the Company is unable to complete its Business Combination and the SPARs expire, the Company, subject to the approval of the stockholders and the Company s Board, will dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Any remaining assets of the Company will be distributed to the holders of the Sponsor Shares, which are expected to consist solely of the Sponsor in its capacity as the holder of the Sponsor Shares, subject to applicable law.

Public Shares in respect of SPARs issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 that will generate aggregate proceeds of a minimum of if all such SPARs are exercised. SPAR Trading During much of 2024 (commencing shortly after the Company completed its distribution on September 30, 2023), the New York Stock Exchange NYSE has been developing a rule change to the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Section 703.12 Listing Standards for Warrants and Rights. The effect of this rule change would be beneficial to the Company; if enacted, it would permit, subject to certain conditions, SPAR trading to begin on the NYSE immediately (rather than over-the-counter or pink sheet markets). On August 13, 2024, the SEC issued an Order Instituting Proceedings to Determine Whether to Approve or Disapprove a Proposed Rule Change notice (the Notice ). The effect of such Notice may be that the SEC intends to reject the rule; in addition, the Notice gives reasons for possibly doing so. The SEC has not formally rejected the rule and it may be possible either to have the NYSE develop rationale to counter the reasoning in the Notice or re-issue a new rule with the same or similar effect that addresses the concerns in the Notice. The Company is monitoring the developments closely, but no assurances can be given that the rule (or amendments thereto) will be successful. If the rule were unsuccessful, SPARs during the SPAR Holder Election Period would be quoted on the OTCQX marketplace of the OTC Markets Group, as previously described. 

 Sponsor Shares, at an aggregate price of , or per Sponsor Share. In the event that the Final Exercise Price is higher than the minimum exercise price of , the Company will carry out a reverse stock split of the Sponsor Shares such that the effective per-share purchase price of the Sponsor Shares is equal to the Final Exercise Price. The Sponsor Shares are subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to the subscription agreement between the Company and the Sponsor, which provides that such shares are not transferable or salable unless (a) a registration statement on the appropriate form under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws with respect to the Sponsor Shares proposed to be transferred is then effective or (b) the Company has received an opinion from counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such registration is not required because such transaction is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and the rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder and with all applicable securities laws.

in a private placement, of which was deposited into the Segregated Account. The transaction price of the Sponsor Warrants was determined by the Company, in consultation with a third-party, nationally recognized valuation firm, based on its fair value as of the previous month-end. The Sponsor Warrants are exercisable, in the aggregate, for up to of the Public Shares that are outstanding as of the time immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, on a fully diluted basis (including without limitation Public Shares issued upon exercise of the SPARs, Public Shares issued pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreements, Public Shares issued to the target business or its shareholders and Public Shares issuable upon the exercise of Sponsor and Advisor Warrants or the conversion or exercise of then-outstanding securities of the Surviving Corporation, whether or not convertible or exercisable at such time). The Company refers to the number of Public Shares into which the Sponsor Warrants are exercisable as the Reference Shares. The actual percentage of the Public Shares on a fully diluted basis into which the Sponsor Warrants are exercisable will depend on the amount of funds raised by the exercise of SPARs at the closing of the Business Combination and the amount of the Additional Forward Purchase, if any, made by the Additional Forward Purchaser, and will be calculated by multiplying by a fraction (the Proration Fraction ), (i) the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the amount of funds raised by the exercise of SPARs at the closing of the Business Combination and (B) the amount of the Additional Forward Purchase, if any, funded by the Additional Forward Purchaser at the closing of the Business Combination (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the Second Tranche Additional Forward Purchase) and (ii) the denominator of which is the amount of funds that would have been raised at the Final Exercise Price if all SPARs issued and outstanding immediately prior to the start of the SPAR Holder Election Period had been exercised at the closing of the Business Combination, excluding for the avoidance of doubt the amount of the Additional Forward Purchase (i.e., at the Minimum Exercise Price, and assuming all SPARs as of September 30, 2024 are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the start of the SPAR Holder Election Period, the denominator will be ). Because the Additional Forward Purchaser may exercise the Second Tranche Additional Forward Purchase at its election after the SPAR Holder Election Period as described above, the Additional Forward Purchaser (which, like the Sponsor, is an affiliate of PSCM) has the ability to prevent the Proration Fraction from being reduced to less than 1.0. In no event, however, will the Proration Fraction exceed ; accordingly, under no circumstance will the Sponsor Warrants be exercisable, in the aggregate, for in excess of of the Public Shares that are outstanding as of the time immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, on a fully diluted basis (the Proration ). The Sponsor Warrants are exercisable at any time after the three-year anniversary, and on or prior to the 10-year anniversary, of the Business Combination and have an exercise price equal to 120 of the Final Exercise Price (the Reference Price ). The Sponsor Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis, with the number of Public Shares to be issued upon exercise calculated as the number of Reference Shares, multiplied by (x) the fair market value of a Public Share in excess of the Reference Price, divided by (y) the fair market value of a Public Share. As used above, fair market value refers to the volume-weighted average trading price of a Public Share over the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to a notice of exercise being sent. The Sponsor Warrants and the Public Shares issuable upon exercise of the Sponsor Warrants will generally not be saleable or transferable until three years after the consummation of the Business Combination (except to certain permitted transferees) and are subject to certain adjustments and registration rights. The Sponsor Warrants will expire on the date that is years from the consummation of the Business Combination. The Sponsor Warrants may be exercised in whole or in part and will not be subject to redemption. Advisor Warrants On September 29, 2023, the Company issued warrants at cost to the Company s advisory board members (the Advisor Warrants ). The Advisor Warrants are identical to the Sponsor Warrants, including with respect to the Proration, transfer restrictions and registration rights, except that the Advisor Warrants (i) will be exercisable, in the aggregate, for up to approximately of the Public Shares that are outstanding as of the time immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination, on a fully diluted basis and (ii) will expressly provide that if the percentage of Public Shares into which the Sponsor Warrants are exercisable is reduced for any reason, the percentage of Public Shares into which the Advisor Warrants are exercisable will be reduced proportionally. 

 - 12 - 

with respect to each advisory board member, or in the aggregate. The repurchase right may be assigned or transferred to one of the Company s affiliates and must be exercised, if at all, by the date that is the later of (i) the anniversary of the date on which the SPARs were first distributed pursuant to the Prospectus and (ii) days after the effective date of such advisory board member s resignation. In the event the Company (or an affiliate) does not exercise the repurchase right by such time, the resigning advisory board member will retain the Advisor Warrants. The repurchase price of the Advisor Warrants was established by the Sponsor in its discretion and was not intended to, and may not, represent the fair market value of the Advisor Warrants as of the time of issuance or any time of potential repurchase. The repurchase price and other terms of the Advisor Warrants were established in order to attract what the Company believes are highly experienced and capable advisory board members, and were based on the significant time commitment expected of an advisory board member, including with respect to assisting the Company in identifying potential Business Combination candidates, the novel nature of the Company in the public market and the risks and responsibilities attendant to untested public vehicles, the potential term of the Company, the skill, expertise and business contacts of the advisory board members, and the value of the advisory board members respective time in light of their experience and other professional responsibilities. The repurchase price was also established at a price the Company believes will likely be a substantial discount to the fair value of the Advisor Warrants immediately after the Business Combination, which the Company believes incentivizes the advisory board members to remain on the board over time. In the event an advisory board member elects to resign during the time periods described above, the Company currently anticipates that it or the Sponsor will likely exercise its repurchase right (assuming the Company or the Sponsor, as applicable, believed that the repurchase price was less than the then fair value of the Advisor Warrants as of such time), and contemplates that any such repurchase would reasonably compensate such an advisory board member for their service on the board. The repurchase was structured as the Company s repurchase right (and not the Company s obligation) to permit the Company to decide, at the time of any advisory board member resignation, whether or not the exercise of the repurchase right is advantageous to the Company in light of market and other conditions then applicable to the Company. As discussed in Note 2, the Advisor Warrants have a settlement feature that results in liability classification as the Advisor Warrants repurchase price on the grant date under ASC 718 and upon the consummation of the Business Combination (or vesting date) will be measured at fair value. The Advisor Warrants were granted to the advisory board members on September 29, 2023 and as a result the Company recorded compensation expense of and a corresponding Advisor Warrants liability of . Forward Purchase Agreements On September 29, 2023, the Pershing Square Funds (the Committed Forward Purchasers and PS SPARC I Master, L.P., a Cayman Islands limited partnership managed by PSCM (the Additional Forward Purchaser and together with the Committed Forward Purchasers, the Forward Purchasers entered into the forward purchase agreements (the Forward Purchase Agreements ), pursuant to which an aggregate amount of billion of Public Shares may be purchased.

Registration Rights Agreement On September 29, 2023, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the Sponsor, the Forward Purchasers and the advisory board members, pursuant to which the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement within days of the Business Combination, and use best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable (but in no event later than days) thereafter, providing for the resale, under Rule 415 of the Securities Act, of (i) the Sponsor Shares, (ii) the Public Shares issuable upon exercise of the Sponsor Warrants, (iii) the Public Shares issuable upon exercise of the Advisor Warrants, (iv) the Public Shares issued pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreements and (v) any other shares of the Company that the parties to the Registration Rights Agreement have purchased on the open market, subject to certain conditions as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement. The parties to the Registration Rights Agreement, and their permitted transferees, are entitled to make up to demands that the Company registers these securities, and will have certain piggyback rights with respect to other registration statements filed by the Company. The post-combination business will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any registration statements.

Their annual compensation is recorded under compensation expense in the statements of operations and will be reviewed by the Company s compensation committee on an annual basis. Mr. Ackman does not receive any compensation from the Company in either his capacity as a director or as an officer. The directors and officers, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on behalf of the Company such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. The Company s audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of those expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on behalf of the Company.

Level 3 Reconciliation The following table presents the change in fair value of the Company s Level 3 financial instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s management employed an independent third-party valuation firm to conduct valuations for the Sponsor Warrants, the SPARs and the Forward Purchase Agreements. The independent third-party valuation firm provided the Company s management with a written report documenting their recommended valuations as of the determination date.

Forward Purchase Agreements 

Total 

As discussed in Note 2, the Sponsor Warrants were accounted for as a liability. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. At each reporting period the Company re-evaluates the inputs utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants, with changes in fair value reflected on the statements of operations. The SPARs and Forward Purchase Agreements were accounted for as liabilities and their fair values were determined based on a number of factors embedded in the instruments, mainly that no active trading market exists for either instrument and it is likely that the Final Exercise Price of the SPARs will be set at a price that equates to its fair value. As a result, the fair values of the SPARs and Forward Purchase Agreements liabilities will likely remain unchanged until the SPARs are quoted on the OTCQX marketplace of the OTC Markets Group beginning at the SPAR Holder Election Period. The Company continues to re-evaluate its assumptions and significant estimates on these financial instruments at each reporting period when the financial statements are prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or as the Company approaches a Definitive Agreement towards a Business Combination.

-year term. The Probability of Not Completing a Deal relates to the Company s deadline to complete its Business Combination by the expiration of the Sponsor Warrants term. The Expected Time to Complete a Deal considers the Company s timeframe to consummate a Business Combination with all necessary shareholder and Board approvals to be the midpoint of the remaining time of the -year deadline. The Probability of Warrant Renegotiation is a discount based on the probability that the Sponsor Warrants will be restructured at the time of the Company s Business Combination. The discount of is representative of the average of sponsor incentive restructurings and founder stock forfeitures in completed blank check company transactions. The Estimated Target Equity Value is the Company s assumption of the total equity capital of the entity following its Business Combination. This assumption factors in the Company s available capital at the time of the deal which is the estimated proceeds from the exercise of the SPARs and the Forward Purchase Agreements, and applies a multiplier to the Company s available capital based on its observation of the median multiple between historical blank check companies available capital and the equity value of their eventual merger targets.

The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

 Overview 
 We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 3, 2021 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the exercise of our SPARs and the private placements of the Sponsor Shares, Sponsor Warrants, Forward Purchase Shares, or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 
 The issuance of additional shares in a Business Combination, including the Forward Purchase Shares: 
 may significantly dilute the equity interest that exercising SPAR holders would have otherwise obtained; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of our Common Stock if preferred shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Common Stock; 

could cause a change in control if a substantial number of ordinary or preferred shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present directors and officers; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our SPARs and, following our Business Combination, our Common Stock. 

Similarly, if we issue debt instruments or otherwise incur significant debt to banks or other lenders or owners of a target, it could result in: 
 default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

- 18 - 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our Common Stock; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Common Stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and 

other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital, including through the exercise of our SPARs and the sale of Forward Purchase Shares, or to complete our Business Combination will be successful. 
 Results of Operations 
 All activities since the Company s inception through September 30, 2024 were related to the Company s organizational activities, preparation for, and the distribution of, SPARs, and searching for a Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We may generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We will incur substantially increased expenses in future periods as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 703,700, which consisted of (i) non-cash loss related to change in the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants liability of 282,703, (ii) Directors compensation expense of 225,000 and (iii) accounting, franchise tax, legal, printing, research, and other expenses totaling 195,997. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 6,855,946, which consisted of (i) non-cash loss related to change in the fair value of the Sponsor Warrants liability of 2,270,951 (ii) Directors compensation expense of 3,000,000 and (iii) accounting, franchise tax, legal, printing, research, consulting, and other expenses totaling 1,584,995. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity needs have been satisfied by the sale of 4,225,330 Sponsor Shares and the sale of 35,892,480 Sponsor Warrants to the Sponsor in private placements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a cash balance of 23,349,031 and 24,992,649, respectively, in the operating account, after funding 5,001,000 to the Segregated Account. We will hold these funds in cash. 
 We will use the funds in the operating account primarily to pay ongoing expenses and director compensation and to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 
 - 19 - 

We intend to use substantially all of the funds provided by the exercise of our SPARs to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt financing is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds from the exercise of SPARs, and any remaining proceeds from the sale of Forward Purchase Shares, will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 
 In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended Business Combination, our Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, purchase additional Sponsor Shares. 
 If our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing to complete our Business Combination if the cash consideration to be paid exceeds our capital available, including because a lower-than-expected number of SPAR holders choose to exercise their SPARs or because an insufficient amount of Additional Forward Purchase Shares are purchased. In such case, we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we may be forced to cease operations. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations or operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of the unaudited financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies. 
 Advisor Warrants Liability 
 The Advisor Warrants were issued at no cost to our advisory board members. Accordingly, we account for the Advisor Warrants under ASC 718 Stock compensation as the instruments were issued in connection with services provided towards our operations and potential Business Combination by the advisory board. The Advisor Warrants have a settlement feature whereby we or our Sponsor have the option to purchase the warrant from the holder upon the termination of their services for 1,000,000. The settlement feature results in liability classification at the Advisor Warrants repurchase price on grant date. Upon the consummation of our Business Combination (or vesting date), the outstanding liability will be measured at fair value. 
 Sponsor Warrants Liability 
 We account for the Sponsor Warrants pursuant to applicable guidance in ASC 480 Distinguishing liabilities from equity ASC 480 and ASC 815-40 Contracts in an entity s own equity ASC 815-40 ), under which the Sponsor Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment because the number of underlying Public Shares for which the Sponsor Warrants are exercisable is dependent upon the number of Public Shares outstanding immediately following the consummation of our Business Combination along with the amount of funds raised in connection therewith. Accordingly, the Sponsor Warrants fair value at initial measurement was recorded as a derivative liability, and subsequent changes in fair value will be reflected on the statement of operations at each reporting period. The fair value of the Sponsor Warrants is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the Sponsor Warrants classification will be re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. See Note 6 of the notes to the unaudited financial statements included herein for further information on the significant inputs utilized to determine fair value. 
 - 20 - 

SPARs and Forward Purchase Agreement Liabilities 
 We account for the SPARs and the Forward Purchase Agreements in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40. Under this guidance, we have determined that the SPARs and the Forward Purchase Agreements do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and will be recorded as derivative liabilities. Upon issuance, we recorded the initial fair value of the SPARs and Forward Purchase Agreements as expenses because such instruments were distributed to parties other than shareholders and accordingly may not be recognized as dividends under ASC 505, Equity . These liabilities will subsequently be measured at fair value with changes in fair value reflected on the statement of operations at each reporting period. The classification of these instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, will be re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. See Note 6 of the notes to the unaudited financial statements included herein for further information on their fair values. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 Item 3. Quan titative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. The funds received in connection with the submission of Elections will be held in a Custodial Account until the consummation of our Business Combination, or will be returned to electing SPAR holders in connection with certain events. The funds that are held in the Custodial Account will be held in cash or, at our election, will be invested in U.S. Treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. Treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 
 Item 4. Con trols and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Due to a transition period established by SEC rules applicable to newly public companies, our management is not required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not address whether there have been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting.
