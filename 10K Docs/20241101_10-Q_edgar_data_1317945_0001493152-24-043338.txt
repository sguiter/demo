 NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

Recognition
 of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation the Company
 satisfies performance obligations at a point in time when control of the goods transfers
 to the customer. Determining the point in time when control transfers requires judgment.
 Indicators considered in determining whether the customer has obtained control of a good
 include: 

The
 Company has a present right to payment 

The
 customer has legal title to the goods 

The
 Company has transferred physical possession of the goods 

The
 customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 

The
 customer has accepted the goods 

It
is important to note that the indicators are not a set of conditions that must be met before the Company can conclude that control of
the goods has transferred to the customer. The indicators are a list of factors that are often present if a customer has control of the
goods. 

The
Company has typical, unmodified FOB shipping point terms. As the seller, the Company can determine that the shipped goods meet the agreed-upon
specifications in the contract or customer purchase order (e.g., items, quantities, and prices) with the buyer, so customer acceptance
would be deemed a formality, as noted in ASC 606-10-55-86. As a result, the Company has a legal right to payment upon shipment of the
goods. 

Based
upon the above, the Company has concluded that control substantively transfers to the customer upon shipment. 

Other
considerations of Topic 606 include the following: 

Contract
 Costs - costs to obtain a contract (e.g. customer purchase order) include sales commissions.
 Under Topic 606, these costs may be expensed as incurred for contracts with a duration of
 one year or less. The majority of the Company s customer purchase orders are fulfilled
 (e.g. goods are shipped) within two days of receipt. 

Warranties
 - the Company does not offer a warranty as a separate component for customers to purchase.
 A warranty is generally included with each purchase, providing assurance that the goods comply
 with agreed-upon specifications, and the cost is therefore accrued accordingly, but contracts
 do not include any requirement for additional distinct services. Therefore, there is not
 a separate performance obligation, and there is no impact of warranties under Topic 606 upon
 the financial reporting of the Company. 

Returned
 Goods - from time to time, the Company provides authorization to customers to return
 goods. If deemed to be material, the Company would record a right of return 
 asset for the cost of the returned goods which would reduce cost of sales. 

Volume
 Rebates (Promotional Incentives) - volume rebates are variable (dependent upon the volume
 of goods purchased by our eligible customers) and, under Topic 606, must be estimated and
 recognized as a reduction of revenue as performance obligations are satisfied (e.g. upon
 shipment of goods). Also under Topic 606, to ensure that the related revenue recognized would
 not be probable of a significant reversal, the four following factors are considered: 

The
 amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the Company s influence. 

The
 uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period
 of time. 

The
 Company s experience with similar types of contracts is limited. 

The
 contract has a large number and broad range of possible consideration amounts. 

If
it was concluded that the above factors were in place for the Company, it would support the probability of a significant reversal of
revenue. However, as none of the four factors apply to the Company, promotional incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue based
upon estimates of the eligible products expected to be sold. 

Regarding
disaggregated revenue disclosures, as previously noted, the Company s business is controlled as a single operating segment that
consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose. Most of the Company s transactions are very similar in nature, contract,
terms, timing, and transfer of control of goods. As indicated in this Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, under the caption Significant
Concentrations , the majority of the Company s sales were geographically contained within North America, with the remainder
scattered internationally. All performance assessments and resource allocations are generally based upon the review of the results of
the Company as a whole. 

The
reserve for credit losses, which include future credits, discounts, and doubtful accounts, was and as of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

The
Plan has been amended and restated, for all grants made starting January 1, 2023, to set the vesting method to three-year cliff vesting
following the grant date, with payment upon maturity. Additionally, for grants made starting January 1, 2023, upon retirement at age
67 or greater, and with one year of continuous service prior to retirement, vesting of the issued grant(s) would accelerate on a pro-rata
basis, 1/3 per year from the grant date. 

Further
details of the Plan are provided in Note 7, Stock Based Compensation Plans, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included
in this report. 

to per claim,
depending on the terms of the policy and the applicable policy year, up to an aggregate amount. The Company is vigorously defending against
all known claims. 

There
are some exceptions which the Company has elected in its accounting policies. For leases with terms of twelve months or less, or below
the Company s general capitalization policy threshold, the Company has elected an accounting policy to not recognize lease assets
and lease liabilities for all asset classes. The Company recognizes lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. 

The
Company determines if a contract is a lease at the inception of the arrangement. The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate,
or purchase its right-of-use assets at the inception of the lease and accounts for these options when they are reasonably certain to
be exercised. Certain leases contain non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, which are generally accounted for separately.
In general, the Company will assess if non-lease components are fixed and determinable, or variable, when determining if the component
should be included in the lease liability. For purposes of calculating the present value of the lease obligations, the Company utilizes
the implicit interest rate within the lease agreement when known and/or determinable, and otherwise utilizes its incremental borrowing
rate at the time of the lease agreement. 

These concentrations are consistent with those discussed in detail in the Company s Form 10-K. 

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, consisted of the following: 

Raw Materials 

Inventories - Net 

Cash surrender value of life insurance policies 

Other 

Other Long Term Assets 

The
Company maintains inventories, net of reserves of as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which are estimated to be
used beyond the next twelve months, mainly for the corrugated medical tubing CMT products. Higher amounts of materials
for the CMT products were initially purchased for cost considerations and because of longer required lead times. 

The
Company has obtained and is the beneficiary of life insurance policies with respect to past employees. 

, with a letter of credit sublimit,
expiring , with funds available for working capital and other corporate purposes. The interest rate payable on any borrowings
is either the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the Bank s Prime Rate, as specified by the Company, plus the Applicable Margin. due and payable on each anniversary date of the
Facility. The Company may terminate the Facility at any time as long as there are no amounts outstanding and may prepay any borrowings.
Prior to this, the Company had been operating in adherence with the December 1, 2017 agreement, as discussed below. 

On
December 1, 2017, the Company agreed to an Amended and Restated Revolving Line of Credit Note (the Line and Third Amendment
to the Loan Agreement with the Bank. The Company established a line of credit facility in the maximum amount of , maturing
on , with funds available for working capital purposes and other cash needs. The Line was unsecured and extended through
the effective date of the Facility of July 3, 2023. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings on the Facility or the Line, as applicable, and
was in compliance with all debt covenants. 

to per month
with the term of such payments limited to 15 years after the employee s retirement. The net present value of the retirement payments
associated with these agreements is as of September 30, 2024, of which is included in Other Long Term Liabilities,
and the remaining current portion of is included in Other Liabilities, associated with the applicable retirement benefit payments
over the next twelve months. The December 31, 2023 liability of had reported in Other Long Term Liabilities, and a
current portion of in Other Liabilities. 

In
addition to the above, the Company has other contractual employment and or change of control agreements in place with key employees,
as previously disclosed and noted in the Exhibit Index to the Company s Form 10-K. Obligations related to these arrangements are
currently indeterminable due to the variable nature and timing of possible events required to incur such obligations. 

As
disclosed in detail in Note 8, Leases, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, the Company has several
lease obligations in place that will be paid over time. Most notably, the Company leases facilities in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the U.K.
which provides manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution; in West Chester, Pennsylvania which provides warehousing, quality control,
distribution, and corporate offices; and in Houston, TX which provides manufacturing, stocking, and sales operations. 

Lastly,
as provided in Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources , of the Company s Form 10-K, the Company has numerous
contractual obligations in place for the current year, mainly related to purchase obligations for the Company s raw material inventories. 

Contingencies 

In
the ordinary and normal conduct of the Company s business, it is subject to lawsuits, investigations, and claims (collectively,
the Claims ). The Claims generally relate to potential lightning or other electrical damage to our flexible gas piping products
and may result in legal and product liability related expenses. The Company does not believe the Claims have legal merit and vigorously
defends them. It is possible that the Company may incur increased litigation costs in the future due to a variety of factors, including
a higher number of Claims, higher legal and expert costs, and higher insurance deductibles or self-insured retention limits (or retentions ). 

The
Company has in place commercial general liability insurance policies that cover most Claims, which are subject to deductibles or retentions,
ranging primarily from to per claim (depending on the terms of the policy and the applicable policy year), up to
an aggregate amount. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and management is unable to predict the outcome of the pending suits
and claims. The potential liability for a given claim could range from zero to a maximum of , depending upon the circumstances,
and insurance deductible or retention in place for the respective claim year. The aggregate maximum exposure for all current open Claims
as of September 30, 2024 is estimated to not exceed approximately , which represents the potential costs that may be incurred
over time for the Claims within the applicable insurance policy deductibles or retentions. From time to time, depending upon the nature
of a particular case, the Company may decide to spend in excess of a deductible or retention to enable more discretion regarding the
defense, although this is not common. It is possible that the results of operations or liquidity of the Company, as well as the Company s
ability to procure reasonably priced insurance, could be adversely affected by the pending litigation, potentially materially. The Company
is currently unable to estimate the ultimate liability, if any, that may result from the pending litigation, or potential litigation
from future claims or claims that have not yet come to our attention, and accordingly, the liability in the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements primarily represents an accrual for legal costs for services previously rendered, outstanding settlements for Claims not yet
paid, and anticipated, probable, settlements for Claims within the Company s remaining retention under its insurance policies.
The liabilities recorded in the Company s books as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively,
and are included in Other Liabilities. 

The Units are not shares of the Company s common stock, and a recipient of the Units does
not receive any of the following: 

ownership
 interest in the Company; 

shareholder
 voting rights; and 

other
 incidents of ownership to the Company s common stock 

The Units will be paid on their
maturity date, one year after all the Units granted in a particular award have fully vested, unless a specified event occurs under the
terms of the Plan, which would allow for earlier payment. Units granted with value at the maturity date equal to the closing price of
the Company s common stock as of the maturity date are defined as Full Value Units. Unless stated otherwise, all Units described
herein are Full Value Units. 

In
2009, the Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the Plan to pay an amount equal to the value of any cash or stock dividend declared
by the Company on its common stock to be accrued to the Units outstanding as of the record date of the common stock dividend. The dividend
equivalent will be paid at the same time the underlying Units are paid to the participant. 

In
addition, the Plan has been amended and restated, for all grants made starting January 1, 2023, to set the vesting method to three-year
cliff vesting following the grant date, with payment upon maturity. Additionally, for grants made starting January 1, 2023, upon retirement
at age 67 or greater, and with one year of continuous service prior to retirement, vesting of the issued grant(s) would accelerate on
a pro-rata basis, 1/3 per year from the grant date. 

In
certain circumstances, the Units may be immediately vested upon the participant s death or disability. All Units granted to a participant
are forfeited if the participant is terminated from their relationship with the Company or its subsidiary for cause, which
is defined under the Plan. If a participant s employment or relationship with the Company is terminated for reasons other than
for cause, then any vested Units will be paid to the participant upon termination. However, Units granted to certain specified
employees as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code will be paid approximately 181 days after termination.

of Units. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had nonvested and unmatured Units outstanding. In March 2024, the Company
paid for fully vested and matured Units that were granted during 2020, including their respective earned dividend values.
In addition, the Company granted an additional Units with a fair value of per Unit on grant date, using historical volatility.
In September 2024, the Company paid for fully vested and matured Units that were granted during 2020, including their respective
earned dividend values. Finally, unvested Units were forfeited. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had nonvested and unmatured
Units outstanding. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method for determining fair value of the Units. The Company uses the straight-line
method of attributing the value of the stock based compensation expense relating to the Units. The compensation expense (including adjustment
of the liability to its fair value) from the Units is recognized over the vesting and maturity periods of each grant. 

The
FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , requires forfeitures either to be estimated at the time of grant and revised,
if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates to derive an estimate of awards ultimately to vest
or to recognize the effect of any forfeited awards for which the requisite vesting period is not completed in the period that the award
is forfeited. 

The
Company recognizes the reversal of any previously recognized compensation expense on forfeited awards in the period that the award is
forfeited. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, awards were forfeited. During the nine months September 30,
2024, a reversal of of previously recognized compensation expense was recognized on nonvested forfeited Units. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, a reversal of of previously recognized compensation expense was recognized on nonvested
forfeited Units. 

The
total liability related to the Units as of September 30, 2024 was of which is included in Other Liabilities, as it
is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, and the balance of is included in Other Long Term Liabilities. The total
liability related to the Units as of December 31, 2023 was of which was included in Other Liabilities, and the balance
of was included in Other Long Term Liabilities. 

Related
to the Plan, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation , the Company recorded compensation expense
of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded compensation expense
of and compensation income of for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Compensation expense
or income for a given period largely depends upon fluctuations in the Company s stock price.

Item
2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. This discussion and other parts of this
report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations,
and intentions that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to,
our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Form 10-Q. 

OVERVIEW 

The
Company is a leading manufacturer of flexible metal hose and is currently engaged in a number of different markets, including construction,
manufacturing, transportation, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. 

The
Company s business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose, fittings,
and accessories. The Company s products are concentrated in residential and commercial construction, and general industrial markets,
with a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property and patents issued in various countries around the world. The Company s
primary product, flexible gas piping, is used for gas piping within residential and commercial buildings. Through its flexibility and
ease of use, the Company s TracPipe and TracPipe CounterStrike flexible gas piping,
along with its fittings distributed under the trademarks AutoFlare , allows users to substantially cut the time required
to install gas piping, as compared to traditional methods. The Company s newest product line MediTrac corrugated
medical tubing CMT is used for piping medical gases (oxygen, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and medical vacuum)
in health care facilities. Building on the recognized strengths and strategies employed in the flexible gas piping market, MediTrac 
 CMT can be used in place of rigid copper pipe, and due to its long continuous lengths and flexibility, it can be installed approximately
five times faster than rigid copper pipe, saving on installation labor and construction schedules. The Company s products are manufactured
at its Exton, Pennsylvania and Houston, Texas facilities in the U.S., and in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the U.K. A majority of the Company s
sales across all industries are generated through independent outside sales organizations such as sales representatives, wholesalers
and distributors, or a combination of both. The Company has a broad distribution network in North America and to a lesser extent in other
global markets.

CHANGES
IN FINANCIAL CONDITION 

For
the period ended September 30, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 

The
Company s cash balance of 45,873,000 on September 30, 2024 decreased 483,000 (1.0 from a 46,356,000 balance at December 31,
2023 mainly due to dividend payments of 10,095,000, as detailed in Note 9, Shareholders Equity, to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this report, and capital expenditures of 1,443,000 mostly offset by cash provided by operating activities
of 11,097,000. See the Company s Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statements for further details regarding the change in cash. 

Retained
earnings were 71,630,000 and 68,493,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, increasing 3,137,000 or 4.6 .
The increase was primarily due to net income during the year, as provided on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Income, partially offset by dividends declared during 2024, as discussed in detail in Note 9, Shareholders Equity, to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 

The
Company reported comparative results from operations for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as follows:

Net
Sales. The Company s 2024 third quarter sales of 24,880,000 decreased 2,616,000 or 9.5 compared to the third quarter of
2023, which generated sales of 27,496,000. The decrease in sales is mainly due to lower sales unit volumes as a result of the overall
market being suppressed because of, among other factors, a decline in housing starts. 

Gross
Profit. The Company s gross profit margins were 61.7 and 61.6 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Selling
Expenses . Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing
programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expenses were 4,976,000 and 5,059,000
for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 83,000 or 1.6 . The decrease is mostly
related to commissions due to the lower sales. Selling expenses increased as a percent of net sales compared to last year, being 20.0 
for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and 18.4 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

- 27 - 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative,
executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative
expenses were 3,848,000 and 4,037,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, decreasing by 189,000 or 4.7 .
The incentive compensation component, which is aligned with profitability, decreased mainly due to the changes in the executive management
team at the beginning of the year. Product liability reserves and expenses were also lower. These were partly offset by increases in
stock based compensation, which moves in relation to the Company s stock price, as detailed in Note 7, Stock Based Compensation
Plans, and staffing related costs. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 15.5 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2024 from 14.7 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

Engineering
Expense . Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to
existing products, and manufacturing engineering costs. Engineering expenses were 1,058,000 and 992,000 for the quarters ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, increasing by 66,000 or 6.7 . Engineering expenses increased as a percentage of sales, being 4.3 for
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and 3.6 for the same quarter in 2023. 

Operating
Profits . Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, operating profits were 5,468,000 and 6,859,000 for the quarters ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, decreasing by 1,391,000 or 20.3 . 

Interest
Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts
outstanding on its line of credit. The Company recorded 586,000 of interest income for the third quarter of 2024 and 502,000 for the
third quarter of 2023. Higher invested cash balances are mainly responsible for the higher interest income. 

Other
Income (Expense) . Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions settled in
currencies other than the Company s local currency, typically related to the Company s foreign U.K. and France subsidiaries.
There was a gain of 21,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a loss of 41,000 during the third quarter of 2023. 

Income
Tax Expense . Income tax expense was 1,479,000 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1,746,000 for the third quarter in 2023,
decreasing 267,000 or 15.3 , mostly the result of lower income before income taxes.

Nine

The
Company reported comparative results from operations for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as follows:

Net
Sales. The Company s sales for the first nine months of 2024 of 74,716,000 decreased 8,602,000 or 10.3 compared to the first
nine months of 2023, which generated sales of 83,318,000. The decrease in sales is mainly due to lower sales unit volumes as a result
of the overall market being suppressed because of, among other factors, a decline in housing starts. 

Gross
Profit. The Company s gross profit margins were 61.1 and 61.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decline in gross profit margin is mainly due to lower production, which caused lower absorption of factory labor and overhead costs,
and higher overhead expenses mainly due to newly leased facilities. This is partly offset by lower raw material costs and a decrease
in the provision for excess inventories for MediTrac CMT products. 

Selling
Expenses . Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing
programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expenses were 15,202,000 and 15,631,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 429,000 or 2.7 . The decrease is mostly
related to commissions and freight due to lower sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher travel and recruiting expenses.
Selling expenses increased as a percent of net sales compared to last year, being 20.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
and 18.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative,
executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative
expenses were 11,687,000 and 13,204,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, decreasing by 1,517,000
or 11.5 . The incentive compensation component, which is aligned with profitability, decreased mainly due to the changes in the executive
management team at the beginning of the year and lower profits. Product liability reserves and expenses were also lower along with stock
based compensation, which moves in relation to the Company s stock price, as detailed in Note 7, Stock Based Compensation Plans.
These were partly offset by increases in staffing and computer related expenses. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative
expenses decreased to 15.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 15.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

- 29 - 

Engineering
Expense . Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to
existing products, and manufacturing engineering costs. Engineering expenses were 2,973,000 and 2,854,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, increasing by 119,000 or 4.2 mainly due to higher consulting expenses. Engineering expenses
increased as a percentage of sales, being 4.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 3.4 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Operating
Profits . Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, operating profits were 15,809,000 and 19,686,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, decreasing by 3,877,000 or 19.7 . 

Interest
Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts
outstanding on its line of credit. The Company recorded 1,741,000 and 1,179,000 of interest income during the first nine months of
2024 and 2023, respectively. Higher invested cash balances and interest rates are mainly responsible for the higher interest income. 

Other
Income (Expense) . Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions settled in
currencies other than the Company s local currency, typically related to the Company s foreign U.K. and France subsidiaries.
There was a loss of 39,000 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to a gain of 14,000 during the first nine months of 2023. 

Income
Tax Expense . Income tax expense was 4,241,000 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 5,014,000 for the same period in 2023,
decreasing 773,000 or 15.4 , mostly the result of lower income before income taxes. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Historically,
the Company s primary cash needs have been related to working capital items, which the Company has largely funded through cash
generated from operations. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of 45,873,000. Additionally, the Company has a 15,000,000 line of credit available,
as discussed in detail in Note 5, which had no borrowings outstanding upon it as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the
Company had a cash balance of 46,356,000, with no borrowings against the line of credit. 

We
believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with our borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs
for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors including our rate of revenue growth,
the timing and extent of any expansion efforts, and the potential for investments in, or the acquisition of any complementary products,
businesses, or supplementary facilities for additional capacity.

See
Notes 6 and 8 to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q for a description of the
Company s commitments and contingencies. 

CASH
FLOWS 

Operating
Activities 

Cash
provided or used by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities,
such as those included in working capital. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s operating activities provided cash of 11,097,000, compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 which provided cash of 11,496,000, a decrease of 399,000. For details of the operating cash flows refer
to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part I Financial Information on page nine. 

As
a general trend, the Company tends to deplete or generate lower amounts of cash early in the year, as significant payments are typically
made for incentive compensation and accrued promotional incentives. Cash has then historically shown a tendency to be restored and accumulated
during the latter portion of the year. 

Investing
Activities 

Cash
used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,443,000 and 1,455,000, respectively, as
a result of payments for mainly leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment capital expenditures. 

Financing
Activities 

All
financing activities relate to dividend payments, which are detailed in Note 9, Shareholders Equity. Dividend payments through
the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 amounted to 10,095,000 and 9,793,000, respectively. 

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

See
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In
March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation
of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, updated in December 2022 by ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of Sunset
Date of Topic 848 . The ASUs apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference
LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASUs provide optional expedients and
exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain
criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the ASUs do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships
entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2024, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2024, that an entity
has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. ASU 2020-04, as updated
by ASU 2022-06, is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2024. The impact of the adoption did not have
a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The ASU expands
public entities tax disclosures including improving disclosures surrounding the Company s rate reconciliation, cash taxes paid,
and disaggregation of income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU No. 2023-09 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements. 

Item
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The
Company does not engage in the purchase or trading of market risk sensitive instruments. The Company does not presently have any positions
with respect to hedge transactions such as forward contracts relating to currency fluctuations. No market risk sensitive instruments
are held for speculative or trading purposes. 

Item
4 Controls and Procedures 

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs. 

(b) Changes
in Internal Controls. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
 under the Exchange Act) during the most recent quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
