1. 
 home health, hospice and home care agencies and senior living communities located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
 
 Certain of the Company s subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the Service Center, provide accounting, payroll, human resources, information technology, legal, risk management, and other services to the operations through contractual relationships. The Service Center also provides certain of these services to unaffiliated third parties under management agreements. 
 
 Each of the Company s affiliated operations are operated by separate, independent subsidiaries that have their own management, employees and assets. References herein to the consolidated Company and its assets and activities are not meant to imply, nor should they be construed as meaning, that Pennant has direct operating assets, employees or revenue, or that any of the subsidiaries are operated by Pennant. 

2. 

The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 is derived from the Company s annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which should be read in conjunction with these Interim Financial Statements. Certain information in the accompanying footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements was condensed or omitted for the interim periods presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 All intercompany transactions and balances between the various legal entities comprising the Company have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company presents noncontrolling interests within the equity section of its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the amount of consolidated net income that is attributable to the Company and the noncontrolling interest in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Estimates and Assumptions - The preparation of the Interim Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Interim Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates in the Interim Financial Statements relate to self-insurance reserves, revenue recognition, and intangible assets and goodwill. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
 State relief funding. The Company receives state relief funding through programs from various states, including healthcare relief funding under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), and other state specific relief programs. The funding generally incorporates specific use requirements primarily for direct patient care including labor related expenses that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic or are associated with providing patient care.

 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with its patients by reportable operating segments and payors. The Company has determined that disaggregating revenue into these categories achieves the disclosure objectives to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

 Concentrations - Credit Risk

 Practical Expedients and Exemptions 
 
 As the Company s contracts have an original duration of one year or less, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to its contracts and does not consider the time value of money. Further, because of the short duration of these contracts, the Company has not disclosed the transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of the end of each reporting period or when the Company expects to recognize this revenue. In addition, the Company has applied the practical expedient provided by ASC 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs , and all incremental customer contract acquisition costs are expensed as they are incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.

 affiliated home health, hospice and home care agencies, and affiliated senior living operations. The Company evaluates performance and allocates capital resources to each segment based on an operating model that is designed to maximize the quality of care provided and profitability. The Company s Service Center provides various services to all lines of business. The Company does not review assets by segment and therefore assets by segment are not disclosed below. 
 
 The CODM uses Segment Adjusted EBITDAR from Operations as the primary measure of profit and loss for the Company's reportable segments and to compare the performance of its operations with those of its competitors. Segment Adjusted EBITDAR from Operations is net income (loss) attributable to the Company's reportable segments excluding interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, rent, and, in order to view the operations performance on a comparable basis from period to period, certain adjustments including: (1) costs at start-up operations, (2) share-based compensation, (3) acquisition related costs and credit allowances, (4) the costs associated with transitioning operations, (5) unusual, non-recurring or redundant charges, and (6) net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. General and administrative expenses are not allocated to the reportable segments, and are included as All Other, accordingly the segment earnings measure reported is before allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses. The Company's segment measures may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

. In conjunction with the amendment, the Company incurred additional debt issuance costs of and wrote off previously deferred unamortized debt issuance costs of . After the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement, the interest rates applicable to loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility are, at the Company s election, either (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from to per annum or (ii) Base Rate plus a margin ranging from to per annum, in each case based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement). In addition, Pennant pays a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility that ranges from to per annum, depending on the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is not required to repay any loans under the Amended Credit Agreement prior to maturity in July 2029. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s weighted average interest rate on its outstanding debt was . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had available borrowing on the Amended Revolving Credit Facility of , which was net of outstanding letters of credit of . 
 
 The fair value of the Amended Revolving Credit Facility approximates carrying value, due to the short-term natur e and variable interest rates. The fair value of this debt is categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on the observable market borrowing rates. 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by certain of the Company s independent operating subsidiaries, and is secured by a pledge of stock of the Company's material independent operating subsidiaries as well as a first lien on substantially all of each material operating subsidiary's personal property. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its independent operating subsidiaries to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, amend certain material agreements and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. Financial covenants require compliance with certain levels of leverage ratios that impact the amount of interest. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was compliant with all such financial covenants.

 Under the Pennant Plans, options granted to employees of the subsidiaries of Pennant generally vest over at per year on the anniversary of the grant date. Options expire after the date of grant. 
 
 The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to recognize the value of stock-based compensation expense for share-based payment awards under the Plans. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life. The Company develops estimates based on historical data and market information, which can change significantly over time. 
 
 2023 (a) Under the midpoint method, the expected option life is the midpoint between the contractual option life and the average vesting period for the options being granted. This resulted in an expected option life of years for the options granted. 
 (b) Because the Company s equity shares have been traded for a relatively short period of time, expected volatility assumption was based on the volatility of related industry stocks.

 to years. The Company s independent operating subsidiaries also lease the administrative offices of home health and hospice agencies, which generally have lease terms that range from one to years. Most of these leases contain renewal options, most involve rent increases and none contain purchase options. The lease term excludes lease renewals because the renewal rents are not at a bargain, there are no economic penalties for the Company to renew the lease, and it is not reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the extension options. The Company elected the accounting policy practical expedients in ASC 842 to: (i) combine associated lease and non-lease components into a single lease component; and (ii) exclude recording short-term leases as right-of-use assets and liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Non-lease components, which are not significant overall, are combined with lease components. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s independent operating subsidiaries leased senior living communities from subsidiaries of Ensign Ensign Leases under a master lease arrangement . The existing leases with subsidiaries of Ensign have initial terms of between to years. The total amount of rent expense included in rent - cost of services paid to subsidiaries of Ensign was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition to rent, each of the operating companies are required to pay the following: (1) all impositions and taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); (2) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (4) all community maintenance and repair costs; and (5) all fees in connection with any licenses or authorizations necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. 
 
 of the Company s affiliated senior living communities, excluding the communities that are operated under the Ensign Leases (as defined herein), are operated under separate master lease arrangements. Under these master leases, a breach at a single community could subject one or more of the other communities covered by the same master lease to the same default risk. Failure to comply with Medicare and Medicaid provider requirements is a default under several of the Company s leases and master leases. With an indivisible lease, it is difficult to restructure the composition of the portfolio or economic terms of the master lease without the consent of the landlord.

 The Company has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the DCP for executives, other highly compensated employees, independent contractors and non-employee directors. The independent contractors and non-employee directors are otherwise ineligible for participation in the Company's 401(k) plan. The DCP allows participants to defer the receipt of a portion of their base compensation, and further allows certain participants to defer up to of their base salary and bonus compensation or director fees. At the participant s election, payments can be deferred until a specific date at least after the year of deferral or until termination of engagement with the Company and can be paid in a lump sum or in up to annual installments. Separate deferral elections can be made for each year, and in limited circumstances, existing payment elections may be changed. The amounts deferred are credited with earnings and losses based upon the actual performance of the deemed investments selected by the participant. The rate of return for each participant varies depending on the specific investment elections made by the participant. Additionally, the plan deposits the employee deferrals into a rabbi trust and the funds are generally invested in individual variable life insurance contracts owned by the Company that are specifically designed to informally fund savings plans of this nature.

 The Medicare payment suspension concluded in May 2022, and the UPIC reviewed patient records covering a period to determine whether, in its view, a Medicare overpayment was made. Based on the results of the review, the UPIC initially alleged sampled and extrapolated overpayments of , and withheld that amount through continued recoupment of Medicare payments. The Company is pursuing its appeal rights through the administrative appeals process, including contesting the methodology used by the UPIC to perform statistical extrapolation. To date the Company has been successful in appealing most of the previously denied claims. The Company received the refund of previously withheld amounts totaling as of September 30, 2024. The Company continues to work through the appeals process for the remaining denied claims and expects to be successful in those appeals. Based on the information currently available to the Company, the Company cannot predict the timing or the ultimate outcome of this review including refunds to be received. 
 
 Insurance - The Company retains risk for a substantial portion of potential claims for general and professional liability, workers compensation and automobile liability. Based on changes in law that increase the maximum damages that may be recovered for professional negligence or malpractice claims in states where we operate, including California and Nevada, the costs of maintaining some of these insurance policies may increase in the future. The Company recognizes obligations associated with these costs, up to specified deductible limits in the period in which a claim is incurred, including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. The general and professional liability insurance has a retention limit of per claim with a corridor as an additional out-of-pocket retention we must satisfy for claims within the policy year before the carrier will reimburse losses. The workers compensation insurance has a retention limit of per claim, except for policies held in Texas, Washington and Wyoming which are subject to state insurance and possess their own limits.

Overview 
 
 We are a leading provider of high-quality healthcare services to patients of all ages, including the growing senior population, in the United States. We strive to be the provider of choice in the communities we serve through our innovative operating model. We operate in multiple lines of businesses including home health, hospice and senior living services across Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. We provide home health and hospice operational support through a management service agreement in Connecticut. As of September 30, 2024, our home health and hospice business provided home health, hospice and home care services from 122 agencies operating across these 13 states, and our senior living business operated 54 senior living communities throughout six states. 
 
 The following table summarizes our affiliated home health and hospice agencies and senior living communities as of:

Recent Activities 
 
 Acquisitions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we expanded our operations with the addition of eight home health agencies, three hospice agencies, and three senior living communities. A subsidiary of the Company entered into a separate operations transfer agreement with the prior operator of each acquired operation as part of each transaction. 

Trends 
 
 We have experienced modest senior living occupancy improvement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Though we have seen improvements in occupancy year over year, the highly competitive environment for senior living residents and inflationary factors will continue to impact the rate at which we change our occupancy levels in our senior living communities. 
 
 When we acquire turnaround or start-up operations, we expect that our combined metrics may be impacted. We expect these metrics to vary from period to period based upon the maturity of the operations within our portfolio. We have generally experienced lower occupancy rates and higher costs at our senior living communities and lower census and higher costs at our home health and hospice agencies for recently acquired operations; as a result, we generally anticipate lower and/or fluctuating consolidated and segment margins during years of acquisition growth.

 Government Regulation 
 
 We have disclosed under the heading Government Regulation in the 2023 Annual Report a summary of regulations that we believe materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Since the time of the filing of the 2023 Annual Report, the following regulations have been updated. 
 
 On July 30, 2024, CMS issued the 2025 Hospice Payment Rate Update final rule (the Hospice Payment Final Rule ). The Hospice Payment Final Rule s payment update percentage is 2.9 , which is an estimated increase of 790 million in payments from fiscal year 2024. The payment update percentage is based on a 3.4 market basket percentage increase, which is reduced by a 0.5 productivity adjustment. Hospices that fail to meet quality reporting requirements under the Hospice Quality Reporting Program HQRP will receive a 4 reduction to the annual hospice payment update percentage increase for that year, resulting in a total decrease of 1.1 to those non-compliance hospices payments and more than negating the payment update percentage for fiscal year 2025. The Hospice Payment Final Rule also adds two new process measures to HQRP: timely reassessment of pain impact, and timely reassessment of non-pain symptom impact, which are both expected to begin in fiscal year 2028. In addition, the Hospice Payment Final Rule updates the statutory aggregate cap that limits the overall payments per patient that may be made to a hospice annually. The hospice cap amount for the 2025 fiscal year is 34,465.34, increased from the 2024 fiscal year cap of 33,494.01. The Hospice Payment Final Rule also includes clarifying revisions to the hospice conditions of participation; updates statistical area delineations; and makes changes to the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems CAHPS Hospice Survey. 
 
 On November 1, 2024, CMS issued the 2025 Home Health Prospective Payment System Final Rule (the Home Health Payment Final Rule ). The Home Health Payment Final Rule s payment update percentage for calendar year 2025 is 2.7 , an estimated increase of 445 million from calendar year 2024, which is offset by an estimated -1.8 behavioral adjustment, along with a -0.4 estimated adjustment for fixed dollar losses, resulting in an aggregate net increase of 0.5 , or 85 million, for the calendar year 2025 payment rate compared to calendar year 2024. The Home Health Payment Final Rule also recalibrates PDGM case-mix weights, finalizes an update to the home health wage index, updates home health conditions of participation to require patient acceptance policies, and establishes or updates certain LUPA add-on factors. 
 
 In June 2024, CMS announced a Period of Enhanced Oversight for newly enrolled hospices in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Texas. The program includes hospices that are newly enrolled, or that undergo a change of ownership, or reactivating after being in a deactivated status after July 13, 2023. Such hospices are subject to enhanced oversight for up to one year and may undergo medical review by CMS contractors to deter fraud, waste and abuse of Medicare funds. 
 
 On April 22, 2024, CMS published the Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services Final Rule (the Access Rule which creates and, over the course of five years, implements new obligations for providers of home- and community-based services HCBS ), including non-skilled personal care services in the home. The Access Rule requires that, beginning in 2030, states must implement data collection and monitoring systems to ensure that, subject to exceptions, Medicaid-funded HCBS providers spend at least 80 of their Medicaid HCBS reimbursement on compensation for direct care workers, as opposed to administrative overhead or profits. The Access Rule further requires states to establish a grievance system for addressing services provided in the fee-for-service context, publish fee-for-service payment rates paid by Medicaid, publish the average hourly rate paid to HCBS care providers, and develop hardship exemptions and separate requirements for small providers, with these requirements to be implemented within one to three years from the Access Rule taking effect. The Company anticipates potential changes to the Access Rule, or offsetting Medicaid rate increases, before its ultimate implementation in six years. 
 
 On March 6, 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rule (the Climate Rule ), intended to regulate how public companies report on the risks and impacts of climate-related matters. The Climate Rule requires companies to report on how they manage and assess climate-related risks, as well as how the board and management oversee these risks. The Climate Rule also mandates companies to disclose the financial consequences of extreme weather events and other natural conditions in their audited financial statements. Additionally, larger companies will have to report on their greenhouse gas emissions, which will be subject to a gradual assurance requirement. The Company anticipates that it will be required to disclose information about its management and oversight of climate risks beginning in 2027, and its greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2029, assuming no further changes to the Climate Rule, or to the Company s status as an Accelerated Filer under SEC rules. The Climate Rule is the subject of litigation in various courts and on April 4, 2024, the SEC stayed the Climate Rule pending the outcome of these cases.

Revenue Sources 
 
 Home Health and Hospice Services 
 
 Home Health. We derive the majority of our home health revenue from Medicare and managed care. The Medicare payment is adjusted for differences between estimated and actual payment amounts, an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. Net service revenue is recognized in accordance with PDGM methodology. Under PDGM, Medicare provides agencies with payments for each 30-day period of care provided to beneficiaries. If a beneficiary is still eligible for care after the end of the first 30-day payment period, a second 30-day payment period can begin. There are no limits to the number of periods of care a beneficiary who remains eligible for the home health benefit can receive. While payment for each 30-day period of care is adjusted to reflect the beneficiary s health condition and needs, a special outlier provision exists to ensure appropriate payment for those beneficiaries that have the most expensive care needs. The PDGM payment under the Medicare program is also adjusted for certain variables including, but not limited to: (a) a low utilization payment adjustment if the number of visits is below an established threshold that varies based on the diagnosis of a beneficiary; (b) a partial payment if the patient transferred to another provider or the Company received a patient from another provider before completing the period of care; (c) adjustment to the admission source of claim if it is determined that the patient had a qualifying stay in a post-acute care setting within 14 days prior to the start of a 30-day payment period; (d) the timing of the 30-day payment period provided to a patient in relation to the admission date, regardless of whether the same home health provider provided care for the entire series of episodes; (e) changes to the acuity of the patient during the previous 30-day period of care; (f) changes in the base payments established by the Medicare program; (g) adjustments to the base payments for case mix and geographic wages; and (h) recoveries of overpayments. These variables are subject to periodic adjustments set by CMS regulations. For further detail regarding PDGM see the Government Regulation section of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Hospice. We derive the majority of our hospice business revenue from Medicare reimbursement. The estimated payment rates are calculated as daily rates for each of the levels of care we deliver. Rates are set based on specific levels of care, are adjusted by a wage index to reflect healthcare labor costs across the country and are established annually through federal legislation. The following are the four levels of care provided under the hospice benefit: 
 
 Routine Home Care RHC ). Care that is not classified under any of the other levels of care, such as the work of nurses, social workers or home health aides. 
 General Inpatient Care. Pain control or acute or chronic symptom management that cannot be managed in a setting other than an inpatient Medicare-certified facility, such as a hospital, skilled nursing facility or hospice inpatient facility. 
 Continuous Home Care. Care for patients experiencing a medical crisis that requires nursing services to achieve palliation and symptom control, if the agency provides a minimum of eight hours of care within a 24-hour period. 
 Inpatient Respite Care. Short-term, inpatient care to give temporary relief to the caregiver who regularly provides care to the patient. 
 
 CMS has established a two-tiered payment system for RHC services. Hospices are reimbursed at a higher rate for RHC services provided from days of service one through 60 and a lower rate for all subsequent days of service. CMS also provides for a Service Intensity Add-On, which increases payments for certain RHC services provided by registered nurses and social workers to hospice patients during the final seven days of life. 
 
 Medicare reimbursement is adjusted for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. Additionally, as Medicare hospice revenue is subject to an

 inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap, we monitor our provider numbers and estimate amounts due back to Medicare to the extent that the cap has been exceeded. 
 
 Senior Living Services . As of September 30, 2024, we provided assisted living, independent living and memory care services in 54 communities. Within our senior living operations, we generate revenue primarily from private pay sources, with a portion earned from Medicaid or other state-specific programs. 

Primary Components of Expense 
 
 Cost of Services (excluding rent, general and administrative expense and depreciation and amortization) . Our cost of services represents the costs of operating our independent operating subsidiaries, which primarily consists of payroll and related benefits, supplies, purchased services, and ancillary expenses such as the cost of pharmacy and therapy services provided to patients. Cost of services also includes the cost of general and professional liability insurance and other general cost of services specifically attributable to our operations. 
 
 Rent Cost of Services . Rent cost of services consists solely of base minimum rent amounts payable under lease agreements to our landlords. Our subsidiaries lease and operate but do not own the underlying real estate at our operations, and these amounts do not include taxes, insurance, impounds, capital reserves or other charges payable under the applicable lease agreements. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense . General and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related benefits and travel expenses for our Service Center personnel, including training and other operational support. General and administrative expense also includes professional fees (including accounting and legal fees), costs relating to information systems, stock-based compensation and rent for our Service Center offices. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization . Property and equipment are recorded at their original historical cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets (ranging from one to 40 years). Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on Interim Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The preparation of the Interim Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis we review our judgments and estimates, including but not limited to those related to self-insurance reserves, revenue, intangible assets, and goodwill. We base our estimates and judgments upon our historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information, including assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate was made. Refer to Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , within the 2023 Annual Report for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies, which are as follows: 
 
 Self-insurance reserves - The valuation methods and assumptions used in estimating costs up to retention amounts to settle open claims of insureds and an estimate of the cost of insured claims up to retention amounts that have been incurred but not reported; 
 Revenue recognition - The amounts owed by private pay individuals for services and estimate of variable considerations to arrive at the transaction price, including methods and assumptions, used to determine settlements with Medicare and Medicaid adjustments due to audits and reviews; and 
 Acquisition accounting and goodwill - The assumptions used to allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions, and the review of goodwill for impairment at the Company s annual impairment test date or upon the occurrence of a triggering event.

 (a) Segment Adjusted EBITDAR from Operations is net income (loss) attributable to the Company's reportable segments excluding interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, rent, and, in order to view the operations performance on a comparable basis from period to period, certain adjustments including: (1) costs at start-up operations, (2) share-based compensation, (3) acquisition related costs and credit allowances, (4) the costs associated with transitioning operations, (5) unusual, non-recurring or redundant charges, and (6) net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. General and administrative expenses are not allocated to the reportable segments, and are included as All Other, accordingly the segment earnings measure reported is before allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses. The Company's segment measures may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. (b) Represents results related to start-up operations. This amount excludes rent and depreciation and amortization expense related to such operations. (c) Share-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes incurred. Share-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes are included in cost of services and general and administrative expense. (d) Non-capitalizable costs associated with acquisitions, credit allowances, and write offs for amounts in dispute with the prior owners of certain acquired operations. (e) During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an affiliate of the Company placed its memory care units into transition and began seeking to sublease the units to an unrelated third party. The amount above represents the net operating impact attributable to the units in transition. The amounts reported exclude rent and depreciation and amortization expense related to such operations and include legal settlement costs associated with an entity transitioned to Ensign. (f) Represents unusual or non-recurring charges for legal services, implementation costs, integration costs, and consulting fees in general and administrative and cost of services expenses.

 The following discussion includes references to certain performance and valuation measures, which are non-GAAP financial measures, including Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Segment Adjusted EBITDA from Operations, and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR (collectively, Non-GAAP Financial Measures ). Non-GAAP Financial Measures are used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP Financial Measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations and company that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, we believe can provide a more comprehensive understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. 
 
 We believe these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements regarding our results of operations because: 
 
 they are widely used by investors and analysts in our industry as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall performance of companies in our industry without regard to items such as interest expense, rent expense and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the book value of assets, the method by which assets were acquired, and differences in capital structures; 
 they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our asset base and capital structure from our operating results; and 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR is used by investors and analysts in our industry to value the companies in our industry without regard to capital structures. 
 
 We use Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 
 
 as measurements of our operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period; 
 to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; 
 to assess the value of a potential acquisition; 
 to assess the value of a transformed operation s performance; 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies; and 
 to compare our operating performance to that of our competitors. 
 
 We typically use Non-GAAP Financial Measures to compare the operating performance of each operation from period to period. We find that Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful for this purpose because they do not include such costs as interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, which may vary from period-to-period depending upon various factors, including the method used to finance operations, the date of acquisition of a community or business, and the tax law of the state in which a business unit operates. 
 
 We also establish compensation programs and bonuses for our leaders that are partially based upon the achievement of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR targets. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures have no standardized meaning defined by GAAP. Therefore, our Non-GAAP Financial Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 
 they do not reflect our current or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 they do not reflect the net interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; 
 in the case of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR, it does not reflect rent expenses, which are normal and recurring operating expenses that are necessary to operate our leased operations; 
 they do not reflect any income tax payments we may be required to make; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 other companies in our industry may calculate the same Non-GAAP Financial Measures differently than we do, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 
 We compensate for these limitations by using Non-GAAP Financial Measures only to supplement net income on a basis prepared in accordance with GAAP in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. Our use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items. 
 
 We strongly encourage investors to review the Interim Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, financial results and measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. We strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of Consolidated Net Income to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the table presented above, along with the Interim Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 We believe the following Non-GAAP Financial Measures are useful to investors as key operating performance measures and valuation measures: 

Performance Measures: 
 
 Consolidated EBITDA 
 
 We believe Consolidated EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our asset base (depreciation and amortization expense) from our operating results. 
 
 We calculate Consolidated EBITDA as net income, before (a) interest expense (b) provision for income taxes and (c) depreciation and amortization. 
 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We adjust Consolidated EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of the additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, when considered with Consolidated EBITDA and GAAP Consolidated Net Income is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance. 
 
 We calculate Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting Consolidated EBITDA to exclude the effects of non-core business items, which for the reported periods includes, to the extent applicable: 
 
 costs at start-up operations; 
 share-based compensation expense; 
 acquisition related costs and credit allowances; 
 costs associated with transitioning operations; and 
 unusual, non-recurring, or redundant charges. 
 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA from Operations 
 
 We calculate Segment Adjusted EBITDA from Operations by adjusting Segment Adjusted EBITDAR from Operations to include rent-cost of services. We believe that the inclusion of rent-cost of services provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance for each segment. 

Valuation Measure : 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR 
 
 We use Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR as one measure in determining the value of prospective acquisitions. It is also a measure commonly used by us, research analysts and investors to compare the enterprise value of different companies in the healthcare industry, without regard to differences in capital structures. Additionally, we believe the use of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR allows us, research analysts and investors to compare operational results of companies with operating and finance leases. A significant portion of finance lease expenditures are recorded in interest, whereas operating lease expenditures are recorded in rent expense. 
 
 This measure is not displayed as a performance measure as it excludes rent expense, which is a normal and recurring operating expense and, as such, does not reflect our cash requirements for leasing commitments. Our presentation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as a financial performance measure. 
 
 The adjustments made and previously described in the computation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are also made when computing Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR. We calculate Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR by excluding rent-cost of services and rent related to start up operations from Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.

Our general and administrative expense increased 3.6 million, or 38.3 , from 9.4 million to 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points from 6.7 to 7.2 during the period. The primary driver of the increase in general and administrative expense was due to an increase in payroll and related benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense remained consistent with the comparable period. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes . We recorded income tax expense of 1.4 million and 1.1 million or 16.9 and 19.3 of earnings before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to more excess tax benefits on equity compensation.

 Our total revenue increased 107.4 million, or 26.9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in revenue was driven by increases in key metrics for home health and hospice and senior living, including hospice admissions, hospice revenue per day, hospice average daily census, senior living occupancy, and senior living revenue per occupied room.

Provision for Income Taxes . We recorded income tax expense of 5.0 million and 3.9 million, or 21.8 and 29.3 of earnings before income taxes, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to more excess tax benefits on equity compensation. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On July 31, 2024, Pennant amended and restated its existing credit agreement (as amended, the Amended Credit Agreement ), which provides for an increased revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks with a borrowing capacity of 250.0 million (the Amended Revolving Credit Facility ). The Amended Revolving Credit Facility is not subject to interim amortization and the Company will not be required to repay any loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility prior to maturity in 2029. The Company is permitted to prepay all or any portion of the loans under the Amended Revolving Credit Facility prior to maturity without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of any SOFR breakage costs of the lenders. 
 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its independent operating subsidiaries to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, amend certain material agreements and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. Financial covenants require compliance with certain levels of leverage ratios that impact the amount of interest. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was compliant with all such financial covenants. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.5 million of cash and 132.8 million of available borrowing capacity on our Amended Revolving Credit Facility. As described in Note 17, Subsequent Events , to the Interim Financial Statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report, on October 2, 2024, the Company closed a public offering of 4,025,000 shares of its common stock with net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after underwriting discounts and commissions and before expenses, of approximately 118.5 million. The proceeds were subsequently used to pay the outstanding balance on our Amended Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash generated through operations, and access to available borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months for our operating activities and for opportunities of acquisition growth. 
 
 The following table presents selected data from our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 18,729 27,910 Net cash used in investing activities (66,287) (17,576) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 45,963 (9,030) Net (decrease) increase in cash (1,595) 1,304 Cash at beginning of period 6,059 2,079 Cash at end of period 4,464 3,383 
 
 44 

Table of Contents 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Our net cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 9.2 million when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of this difference was a decrease in cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities of 14.9 million, net, and a decrease of 2.7 million in non-cash expenses, partially offset by an increase in net income of 8.4 million. 
 
 Our net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 48.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by an increase in business and asset acquisitions. 
 
 Our net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately 55.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a net increase in the balance on our line of credit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 We continue to make draws and payments on our Revolving Credit Facility, as described in Note 11, Debt , to the Interim Financial Statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report. Additionally, we have right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations, as described in the supplemental disclosures of cash flow information in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and in Note 13, Leases, to the Interim Financial Statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Other than those transactions there have been no other material changes to our total obligations during the period covered by this Quarterly Report outside of the normal course of our business. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk . We are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates. On July 31, 2024, Pennant entered into the Amended Credit Agreement, which provides for a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks with a borrowing capacity of 250.0 million. A 1.0 interest rate change would cause interest expense to change by approximately 1.1 million annually based upon our outstanding long-term debt as of September 30, 2024. We manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure you that the ultimate resolution of any legal or administrative proceeding or dispute will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , to the Interim Financial Statements for a description of claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We have disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in the 2023 Annual Report risk factors that materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and disclosed more recent events relevant to our business under Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the 2023 Annual Report and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. In particular, if CMS adopts the Home Health Payment Proposed Rule as a final rule in its current form or in a substantially similar form, we may be adversely affected by decreased Medicare reimbursement for home health services in calendar year 2025. Medicare s rates for home health services not only affect Medicare beneficiaries but may also have consequences for home health patients whose benefits are paid by commercial insurance or other payors that base their payments to home health agencies on Medicare s payment rates. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 5. 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Plan Election 
 
 , , entered into a on (the Rule 10b5-1 Plan ). Mr. Steik s 10b5-1 Plan provides for the potential sale of only the number of shares of the Company s common stock necessary to cover the tax obligations generated by the vesting of shares of the Company s common stock between the adoption date of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan and its expiration on . 
 
 This Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement was entered into during open trading windows and is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1 (c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's policies regarding transactions in Company securities.
