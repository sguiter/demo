 FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as should, anticipate, estimate, approximate, expect, may, will, project, intend, plan, believe and other words of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or events. We have also included forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q concerning, among other things, our strategy, goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, liquidity and capital resources, results of operations, market position and product development. These statements are based on current estimates that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, our actual results could vary materially from our current expectations. There are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. They include: uncertainties related to changes in macroeconomic and/or global conditions, including as a result of increased inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russia; the conflict in the Middle East; other economic recession; our ability to achieve all anticipated benefits of restructuring, simplification and modernization initiatives; Commercial Excellence growth initiatives, Operational Excellence initiatives, our foreign operations and international markets, such as currency exchange rates, different regulatory environments, trade barriers, exchange controls, and social and political instability, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, including environmental, health and safety regulations; potential for future goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges; our ability to protect and defend our intellectual property; continuity of information technology infrastructure; competition; our ability to retain our management and employees; demands on management resources; availability and cost of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products; product liability claims; integrating acquisitions and achieving the expected savings and synergies; global or regional catastrophic events; demand for and market acceptance of our products; business divestitures; energy costs; commodity prices; labor relations; and implementation of environmental remediation matters. We provide additional information about many of the specific risks we face in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other periodic reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We can give no assurance that any goal or plan set forth in our forward-looking statements will be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we do not intend to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments.

 We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular environmental matter is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. When a material loss contingency is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a material loss contingency is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided. The accruals we have established for estimated environmental liabilities represent our best current estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs of addressing identified environmental situations, based on our review of currently available evidence, and taking into consideration our prior experience in remediation and that of other companies, as well as public information released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), other governmental agencies and by the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) groups in which we are participating. The accrued liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination, changes in remedial requirements, technological changes, discovery of new information, the financial strength of other PRPs, the identification of new PRPs and the involvement of and direction taken by the government or the courts on these matters. 
 Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), under which we have been identified by the USEPA or other third party as a PRP with respect to environmental remedial costs at certain Superfund sites. We have evaluated our claims and estimated liability associated with these sites based upon the best information currently available to us. We believe our environmental accruals are adequate to cover our portion of the environmental remedial costs at the sites where we have been designated a PRP, to the extent these expenses are probable and reasonably estimable.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD A) 

OVERVIEW 
 Kennametal Inc. was founded based on a tungsten carbide technology breakthrough in 1938. The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1943 as a manufacturer of tungsten carbide metal cutting tooling and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1967. With more than 85 years of materials expertise, the Company is a global industrial technology leader, helping customers across the Aerospace Defense, Earthworks, Energy, General Engineering and Transportation industries manufacture with precision and efficiency. This expertise includes the development and application of tungsten carbides, ceramics, super-hard materials and solutions used in metal cutting and extreme wear applications to keep customers up and running longer against conditions such as corrosion and high temperatures. 
 Our standard and custom product offering spans metal cutting and wear applications including turning, milling, hole making, tooling systems and services, as well as specialized wear components and metallurgical powders. End users of the Company's metal cutting products include manufacturers engaged in a diverse array of industries including: the manufacturers of transportation vehicles and components, machine tools and light and heavy machinery; airframe and aerospace components; and energy-related components for the oil and gas industry, as well as power generation. The Company s wear and metallurgical powders are used by producers and suppliers in equipment-intensive operations such as road construction, mining, quarrying, oil and gas exploration, refining, production and supply, and for aerospace and defense. 
 Throughout MD A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth (decline), constant currency regional sales growth (decline) and constant currency end market sales growth (decline). We provide the definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the MD A section as well as details on the use and derivation of these financial measures. 
 Our sales of 481.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2 percent from 492.5 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting an organic sales decline of 2 percent and an unfavorable currency exchange effect of 1 percent, partially offset by a favorable business days effect of 1 percent. 
 Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.0 million compared to 45.1 million in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease of 9.1 million was primarily due to lower sales and production volumes within the Metal Cutting segment, higher wages and general inflation, and certain manufacturing costs within the Infrastructure segment, including temporary plant shutdowns for maintenance and process improvements. These factors were partially offset by lower raw material costs, incremental year-over-year restructuring savings of approximately 5 million, a net benefit of 4 million consisting of insurance recoveries of 5 million received during the quarter, offset by charges of 1 million related to the tornado that struck the Rogers, Arkansas facility late in fiscal 2024, lower restructuring charges of approximately 3 million compared to the prior year quarter and higher sales volumes within the Infrastructure segment. 
 Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 7.5 percent compared to 9.2 percent in the prior year quarter. The Metal Cutting and Infrastructure segments had operating margins of 8.0 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia by the United States, Canada, the European Union and other countries. We have experienced increased costs for energy and raw materials and other supply chain issues due, in part, to the negative impact of the conflict on the global economy. During the March quarter of 2022, the Company ceased operations in Russia and subsequently decided to liquidate its legal entity in Russia, which is currently expected to be completed during fiscal 2025. Similarly, the conflict in the Middle East that began in October 2023 could negatively impact the Company's financial condition or results of operations. To date, the conflict in the Middle East has not significantly affected the Company's business activities or results of operations. 
 The recent labor union strike at a large, U.S. aerospace OEM has the potential to negatively affect our business as well as our customers in the Aerospace Defense end market. To date, the strike has not significantly affected the Company's business activities or results of operations. 
 Our business has also been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange and inflationary headwinds. We have been able to partially mitigate the effects of inflation, foreign currency exchange challenges and other disruptions through price increases on our products. We cannot predict the ultimate effect of these issues on our business, operating results or financial condition, but we will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions and attempt to mitigate the negative effect to the extent possible. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, earnings per diluted share (EPS) was 0.28 compared to EPS of 0.37 in the prior year quarter. EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was unfavorably affected by restructuring and related charges of 0.01 per share.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities was 45.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.7 million during the prior year period. Capital expenditures were 24.7 million and 31.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company returned 31 million to shareholders through 15 million in share repurchases and 16 million in dividends. The Company has a long history of consistently paying dividends to shareholders since its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1967. 

RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS 
 SALES Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 481.9 million, a decrease of 10.5 million, or 2 percent, from 492.5 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting an organic sales decline of 2 percent and an unfavorable currency exchange effect of 1 percent, partially offset by a favorable business days effect of 1 percent. 
 Our sales growth (decline) by end market and region are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 (in percentages) As Reported Constant Currency End market sales growth (decline): Aerospace Defense 13 13 Energy 1 2 General Engineering (4) (3) Transportation (4) (2) Earthworks (6) (6) Regional sales (decline) growth: Americas (4) (2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) (2) (1) Asia Pacific 1 2 
 GROSS PROFIT Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 151.0 million, a decrease of 11.9 million from 162.9 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and production volumes within the Metal Cutting segment, higher wages and general inflation, and certain manufacturing costs within the Infrastructure segment, including temporary plant shutdowns for maintenance and process improvements. These factors were partially offset by lower raw material costs, a net benefit of 4 million consisting of insurance recoveries of 5 million received during the quarter, offset by charges of 1 million related to the tornado that struck the Rogers, Arkansas facility late in fiscal 2024, and higher sales volumes within the Infrastructure segment. 
 Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.3 percent, as compared to 33.1 percent in the prior year quarter. 
 OPERATING EXPENSE Operating expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 111.7 million compared to 111.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled 11.1 million and 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES, NET In the June quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced an initiative to streamline our cost structure. Total restructuring and related charges for this program of 20.7 million, compared to a target of approximately 25 million, were recorded through September 30, 2024, consisting of 15.4 million in Metal Cutting and 5.3 million in Infrastructure. The majority of the remaining charges are expected to be recognized in fiscal 2025. This action has delivered annualized run rate pre-tax savings of approximately 35 million.

 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) 

We recorded restructuring and related charges of 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of 0.6 million in Metal Cutting and an immaterial amount in Infrastructure. 
 INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 6.3 million compared to 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.7 million compared to other expense, net of 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income was primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange and higher interest income, partially offset by net periodic pension expense, including a settlement charge of 0.8 million due to the wind-up of the Canadian defined benefit pension plans during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 25.2 percent and 21.0 percent, respectively. The year-over-year change is primarily due to prior year adjustments including a 6.2 million benefit associated with a change in unrecognized tax benefits which was partially offset by a 3.1 million charge to settle tax litigation in Italy. The three months ended September 30, 2024 also includes a benefit of 1.4 million for interest received to resolve an income tax dispute in India and geographical mix. 

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW 
 We operate in two reportable segments consisting of Metal Cutting and Infrastructure. Our reportable operating segments have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities, the manner in which we organize segments for allocating resources, making operating decisions and assessing performance and the availability of separate financial results. We do not allocate certain corporate expenses related to executive retirement plans, our Board of Directors, strategic initiatives, and certain other costs and report them in Corporate. Our reportable operating segments do not represent the aggregation of two or more operating segments. 
 Our sales and operating income by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Sales: Metal Cutting 296,900 308,229 Infrastructure 185,048 184,247 Total sales 481,948 492,476 Operating income: Metal Cutting 23,822 32,117 Infrastructure 12,734 13,644 Corporate (529) (643) Total operating income 36,027 45,118 Interest expense 6,312 6,601 Other (income) expense, net (1,657) 89 Income before income taxes 31,372 38,428

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Metal Cutting sales decreased 4 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by an organic sales decline of 4 percent and an unfavorable currency exchange effect of 2 percent, partially offset by a favorable business days effect of 2 percent. Aerospace Defense end market sales increased in EMEA and the Americas as a result of our focused execution on our growth initiatives, the effects of which were partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific due to lower economic activity in China and certain production challenges at our OEM customers. Energy end market sales were flat, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency effect, due to a decline in wind energy in Asia Pacific, offset by strength in EMEA. Transportation end market sales decreased in EMEA and the Americas as a result of lower volumes and project activity, partially offset by an increase in Asia Pacific due to the execution on our growth initiatives. Sales in the General Engineering end market declined in EMEA and the Americas due to lower economic activity and project timing, partially offset by a sales increase in Asia Pacific. 
 On a regional basis, sales in the Americas decreased primarily due to Transportation and General Engineering. Sales decreased in EMEA as a result of General Engineering and Transportation. Sales in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to Transportation. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Metal Cutting operating income was 23.8 million compared to 32.1 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to l ower sales and production volumes, higher wages and general inflation, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of approximately 2 million. These factors were partially offset by lower raw material costs, incremental year-over-year restructuring savings of approximately 4 million, lower restructuring charges of approximately 2 million compared to the prior year quarter and pricing.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Infrastructure sales increased 0.4 percent from the prior year quarter reflecting organic sales growth of 1 percent, partially offset by an unfavorable business days effect of 1 percent. Aerospace Defense sales increased due to project timing and the execution of our growth initiatives. Energy end market sales increased primarily due to project timing, partially offset by lower U.S. oil and gas activities as land rig counts decreased year-over-year. Sales in the General Engineering end market increased in EMEA and Asia Pacific due to higher demand compared to a soft prior year quarter, offset by a decrease in the Americas stemming from temporary plant shutdowns. Earthworks end market sales decreased due to lower mining activity, including a customer mine closure in the Americas and lower mining activity in Asia, and project order timing. 
 On a regional basis, sales in the Americas were negatively affected by lower mining activity, including a customer mine closure, project order timing and temporary plant shutdowns. Sales in EMEA increased in General Engineering and Aerospace Defense from order timing and execution of our strategic initiatives. Sales in Asia Pacific increased due to higher demand in General Engineering, partially offset by underground mining. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Infrastructure operating income was 12.7 million compared to 13.6 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to certain manufacturing costs, including temporary plant shutdowns for maintenance and process improvements, and higher wages and general inflation. These factors were partially offset by a net benefit of 4 million consisting of insurance recoveries of 5 million received during the quarter, offset by charges of 1 million related to the tornado that struck the Rogers, Arkansas facility late in fiscal 2024, the favorable timing of pricing compared to raw material costs, incremental year-over-year restructuring savings of approximately 1 million, lower restructuring charges of approximately 1 million compared to the prior year quarter and higher sales volumes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash flow from operations is the primary source of funding for our capital expenditures. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash flow provided by operating activities was 45.7 million. 
 During fiscal 2022, we entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 14, 2022 (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement is a five-year, multi-currency, revolving credit facility, which we use to augment cash from operations and as an additional source of funds. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans of up to 700.0 million for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement allows for borrowings in U.S. dollars, euros, pounds sterling and Japanese yen. Interest payable under the Credit Agreement is based upon the type of borrowing under the facility and may be (1) Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR), and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for any borrowings in euros, pounds sterling, yen, and U.S. dollars, respectively, plus an applicable margin, (2) the greater of the prime rate or the Federal Funds effective rate plus an applicable margin, or (3) fixed as negotiated by us. The Credit Agreement matures in June 2027. 
 The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various restrictive and affirmative covenants, including one financial covenant: a maximum leverage ratio where debt, net of domestic cash in excess of 25 million and sixty percent of the unrestricted cash held outside of the United States, must be less than or equal to 3.75 times trailing twelve months EBITDA, adjusted for certain non-cash expenses. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all the covenants of the Credit Agreement, and there were no borrowings outstanding and 700.0 million of additional availability. There were no borrowings outstanding as of June 30, 2024. 
 We consider the majority of the unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. With regard to these unremitted earnings, we have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements. With regard to the small portion of unremitted earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested, we maintain a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes. 
 At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were 119.6 million. Total Kennametal shareholders' equity was 1,277.2 million and total debt was 597.6 million. Our current senior credit ratings are at investment grade levels. We believe that our current financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide us access to the capital markets. We believe that we have sufficient resources available to meet cash requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to closely monitor our liquidity position and the condition of the capital markets, as well as the counterparty risk of our credit providers. There have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments since June 30, 2024. 
 Share Repurchase Program In February 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to purchase up to 200 million of the Company's common stock over a three-year period. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 600 thousand shares of Kennametal common stock for 15 million under its 200 million, three-year share repurchase program. 
 Dividends During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid a total of 15.6 million in dividends to Kennametal Shareholders. 
 Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash flow provided by operating activities was 45.7 million, compared to 25.7 million for the prior year period. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the current year period consisted of net income and non-cash items amounting to an inflow of 61.1 million and changes in certain assets and liabilities netting to an outflow of 15.3 million. Contributing to the changes in certain assets and liabilities were a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 22.3 million and an increase in inventories of 17.5 million. Partially offsetting these cash outflows was a decrease in accounts receivable of 26.6 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, cash flow provided by operating activities was 25.7 million and consisted of net income and non-cash items amounting to an inflow of 81.2 million and changes in certain assets and liabilities netting to an outflow of 55.5 million. Contributing to the changes in certain assets and liabilities were a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 32.6 million, an increase in inventories of 20.3 million, and a decrease in accrued income taxes of 11.7 million. Offsetting these cash outflows was a decrease in accounts receivable of 17.9 million.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Working capital was 605.5 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 18.9 million from 586.6 million at June 30, 2024. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in inventories of 28.8 million, a decrease in other current liabilities of 18.2 million, and a decrease of accrued expenses of 9.4 million, partially offset by a decrease of accounts receivable of 20.3 million, an increase in accounts payable of 10.4 million and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 8.4 million. Currency exchange rate effects increased working capital by a total of approximately 16 million. 
 Property, plant and equipment, net increased 4.1 million from 938.1 million at June 30, 2024 to 942.1 million at September 30, 2024, primarily due to net capital additions of 24.7 million and currency exchange effects of 13 million, partially offset by depreciation expense of 30.8 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, total other assets were 575.9 million, an increase of 12.8 million from 563.1 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in goodwill of 5.8 million and an increase of deferred income taxes of 3.3 million, partially offset by amortization of intangibles of 2.7 million. Currency exchange rate effects increased total other assets by approximately 14 million, the effects of which are included in the aforementioned changes. 
 Kennametal Shareholders' equity was 1,277.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 27.3 million from 1,249.9 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to other comprehensive income attributable to Kennametal of 33.6 million, net income attributable to Kennametal of 22.1 million and capital stock issued under employee benefit and stock plans of 2.1 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid to Kennametal Shareholders of 15.6 million, and the repurchase of capital stock of 15.0 million primarily under the share repurchase program.

RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP 
 In accordance with SEC rules, below are the definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures we use in this report and the reconciliation of these measures to the most closely related GAAP financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-over-year results. The non-GAAP financial measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. We believe these measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP financial measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. 
 Organic sales growth (decline) Organic sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, business days and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. Also, we report organic sales growth (decline) at the consolidated and segment levels. 
 Constant currency end market sales growth (decline) Constant currency end market sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) by end market excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We note that, unlike organic sales growth, constant currency end market sales growth does not exclude the effect of business days. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying end market trends by providing end market sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. Also, we report constant currency end market sales growth (decline) at the consolidated and segment levels. 
 Constant currency regional sales growth (decline) Constant currency regional sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (decline) (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) by region excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We note that, unlike organic sales growth, constant currency regional sales growth does not exclude the effect of business days. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying regional trends by providing regional sales growth (decline) on a consistent basis. Also, we report constant currency regional sales growth (decline) at the consolidated and segment levels.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures since June 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company's management evaluated, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). The Company's disclosure controls were designed to provide a reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. However, the controls have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the controls' stated goals. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance at September 30, 2024 that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION
