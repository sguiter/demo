Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, but not limited to, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A ), Risk Factors and the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) of Kemper Corporation Kemper and its subsidiaries (individually and collectively referred to herein as the Company ), as well as a variable interest entity VIE in which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary, may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based on forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as believe(s), goal(s), target(s), estimate(s), anticipate(s), forecast(s), project(s), plan(s), intend(s), expect(s), might, may, could and other terms of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements, in particular, include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. 
 Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong, and, accordingly, Kemper cautions readers not to place undue reliance on such statements. Kemper bases these statements on current expectations and the current economic environment as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties that may be important in determining the Company s actual future results and financial condition. 
 In addition to the factors discussed under Item 1A., Risk Factors, of Part I of Kemper s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report ), the reader should consider the following list of factors that, among others, could cause the Company s actual results and financial condition to differ materially from estimated results and financial condition.

 Note 3 - 
 operating segments: Specialty Property Casualty Insurance and Life Insurance. 
 The Specialty Property Casualty Insurance segment s principal products are specialty personal automobile and commercial automobile insurance. These products are distributed primarily through independent agents and brokers. The Life Insurance segment s principal products are individual life, accident, supplemental health and property insurance. Career agents employed by the Company distribute these products. Corporate and Other operations include interest expense, board of directors fees, and general corporate expenses incurred by the Company which are not allocated to other businesses. Non-Core Operations includes the results of our Preferred Insurance business which we expect to fully exit. 
 Segment Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) 
 The Company analyzes the operating performance of each segment using segment adjusted operating income (loss) . Segment adjusted operating income (loss) does not equate to income (loss) before income taxes or net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and consistent with authoritative guidance, is the measure of segment performance presented below. Segment adjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by adjusting each segment s income (loss) before income taxes for the following items: 
 (i) Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities ; 
 (ii) Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) ; 
 (iii) Impairment Losses ; 
 (iv) Acquisition and Disposition Related Transaction, Integration, Restructuring and Other Costs; 
 (v) Debt Extinguishment, Pension Settlement and Other Charges; 
 (vi) Goodwill Impairment Charge; 
 (vii) Non-Core Operations; and 
 (viii) Significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations 
 These items are important to an understanding of overall results of operations. Segment adjusted operating income (loss) is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the Company s definition of segment adjusted operating income (loss) may differ from that used by other companies. The Company, however, believes that the presentation of segment adjusted operating income (loss), as measured for management purposes, enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability factors of its businesses.

 Short-term Investments Level 1 or 2 Mortgage Loans Level 3 Company-Owned Life Insurance Level 2 Equity Securities at Modified Cost Level 3 Financial Liabilities: Long-term Debt Level 2 Policyholder Obligations Level 2 
 Loans to policyholders are carried at unpaid principal balance which approximates fair value and are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The nature of policy loans is to have a negligible default risk as the loans are fully collateralized by the value of the policy. Policy loans do not have a stated maturity and the balances and accrued interest are repaid either by the policyholder or with proceeds from the policy. Due to the collateralized nature of policy loans and unpredictable timing of payments, the Company believes the carrying value of policy loans approximates fair value. The fair value measurement of Short-term Investments is estimated using inputs that are considered either Level 1 or Level 2 measurements. The Mortgage Loans fair value measurement is considered equal to amortized cost given the short-term nature of the investments. The fair value measurement of Equity Securities at Modified Cost is estimated using inputs that are considered Level 3 measurements. The cash surrender value of Company-Owned Life Insurance approximates fair value and is considered to be a Level 2 investment. The fair value of Long-term Debt is estimated using quoted prices for similar liabilities in markets that are not active. The inputs used in the valuation are considered Level 2 measurements. Policyholder Obligations presented in the preceding table consist of advances from the FHLB of Chicago, and the inputs used in the valuation are considered Level 2 measurements.

However, the management fee income earned by the AIF is reported in Net Income (Loss) attributable to Kemper Corporation and is included in the basic and diluted earnings per share. 
 Noncontrolling interest is the portion of equity (net assets) not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Since the Company has no ownership interest in Kemper Reciprocal, the difference between the carrying value of the Exchange s assets and liabilities represents noncontrolling interest and any income or loss generated by the net assets of the Exchange is presented as income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. 
 Alternative Energy Partnership 
 The Company invests in an Alternative Energy Partnership formed to provide sustainable energy projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. This entity was formed to invest in newly installed residential solar leases and power purchase agreements. As a result of this investment, the Company has the right to certain investment tax credits and tax depreciation benefits, and to a lesser extent, cash flows generated from the installed solar systems leased to individual consumers. 
 The Company s interest in the Alternative Energy Partnership Investment is considered an investment in a VIE. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and therefore is not required to consolidate the VIE. The project sponsor governs the entity, and the Company only has consent rights that have been deemed protective in nature and does not participate in key economic decisions of the entity. 
 The investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and included in Alternative Energy Partnership Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the HLBV equity method to account for earnings and losses. This method provides an earnings allocation that appropriately reflects the substantive economics of the investment. Earnings and losses on the investment are reported in Change in Value of Alternative Energy Partnership Investments and investment tax credits are recognized in Income Tax Benefit on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance on a consolidated and segment basis that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding for the Company and our investors of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment. 
 Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) 
 The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of its ongoing performance because it reveals underlying operational performance trends that otherwise might be less apparent if the items were not excluded. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is Net Income (Loss) attributable to Kemper Corporation. 
 Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) is an after-tax, non-GAAP financial measure and is computed by excluding from Net Income (Loss) attributable to Kemper Corporation the after-tax impact of: 
 (i) Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities; 
 (ii) Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses); 
 (iii) Impairment Losses; 
 (iv) Acquisition and Disposition Related Transaction, Integration, Restructuring and Other Costs; 
 (v) Debt Extinguishment, Pension Settlement and Other Charges; 
 (vi) Goodwill Impairment Charges; 
 (vii) Non-Core Operations; and 
 (viii) Significant non-recurring or infrequent items that may not be indicative of ongoing operations 
 Significant non-recurring items are excluded when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, and (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. There were no applicable significant non-recurring items that the Company excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Change in Fair Value of Equity and Convertible Securities, Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) and Impairment Losses related to investments included in the Company s results may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions that impact the values of the Company s investments, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Acquisition and Disposition Related Transaction Costs, Integration Costs, and Restructuring and Other Costs may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by the timing of acquisitions and business decisions which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Debt Extinguishment, Pension Settlement and Other Charges relate to (i) loss from early extinguishment of debt, which is driven by the Company s financing and refinancing decisions and capital needs, as well as external economic developments such as debt market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process; (ii) settlement of pension plan obligations which are business decisions made by the Company, the timing of which is unrelated to the underwriting process; and (iii) other charges that are non-standard, not part of the ordinary course of business, and unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Goodwill Impairment Charges are excluded because they are infrequent and non-recurring charges. Non-Core Operations includes the results of our Preferred Insurance business which we expect to fully exit. These results are excluded because they are irrelevant to our ongoing operations and do not qualify for Discontinued Operations under GAAP. Significant non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of the Company s business or economic trends. 
 48 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Continued) 
 Underlying Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses LAE and Underlying Combined Ratio 
 The following discussion uses the non-GAAP financial measures of (i) Underlying Losses and LAE and (ii) Underlying Combined Ratio. Underlying Losses and LAE (also referred to in the discussion as Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE exclude the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years from the Company s Incurred Losses and LAE, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
 The Underlying Combined Ratio is computed by adding the Current Year Non-catastrophe Losses and LAE Ratio with the Insurance Expense Ratio. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the Combined Ratio, which is computed by adding Total Incurred Losses and LAE Ratio, including the impact of catastrophe losses and loss and LAE reserve development from prior years, with the Insurance Expense Ratio. 
 The Company believes Underlying Losses and LAE and the Underlying Combined Ratio are useful to investors and uses these financial measures to reveal the trends in the Company s Property Casualty Insurance segment that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior-year reserve development. These catastrophe losses may cause the Company s loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on incurred losses and LAE and the Combined Ratio. Prior-year reserve developments are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves. Because reserve development relates to the re-estimation of losses from earlier periods, it has no bearing on the performance of the Company s insurance products in the current period. The Company believes it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company s underwriting performance. 
 The preceding non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures, as they do not fully recognize the overall profitability of the Company s businesses.

 Net Income (Loss) attributable to Kemper Corporation 
 Net Income (Loss) attributable to Kemper Corporation increased by 220.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to higher Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income, the absence of a 55.5 million after-tax noncash charge related to the settlement of the Company s pension obligations recorded in 2023, and lower Acquisition and Disposition Related Transaction, Integration, Restructuring and Other Costs from the completion of certain strategic initiatives. 
 Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) increased by 132.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to an improvement in the Specialty Property Casualty Insurance segment profitability driven by lower adverse prior year development, higher average earned premiums per exposure as a result of rate increases, and lower underlying claim frequency. 
 The loss from Non-Core Operations increased by 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to reduced earned premiums during the run-off period and increasing claim severity, partially offset by reduced claim frequency and increased average earned premium as a result of rate increases. 
 Corporate and Other Adjusted Net Operating Loss increased by 5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to increased overhead expenses, partially offset by increased investment income. 
 Net Income (Loss) attributable to Kemper Corporation increased by 543.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to higher Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income and lower Acquisition and Disposition Related Transaction, Integration, Restructuring and Other Costs from the completion of certain

 strategic initiatives and lower costs in connection with the 2023 cost structure optimization initiatives. The increase was also due to the absence of a 55.5 million after-tax noncash charge related to the settlement of the Company s pension obligations recorded in 2023 and the absence of a 45.5 million after-tax charge from the impairment of the goodwill asset related to the Preferred Property Casualty Insurance business that was also recorded in 2023. 
 
 Adjusted Consolidated Net Operating Income (Loss) increased by 364.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to an improvement in the Specialty Property Casualty Insurance segment profitability driven by lower adverse prior year development, higher average earned premiums per exposure as a result of rate increases, and lower underlying claim frequency. 
 The loss from Non-Core Operations increased by 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to reduced earned premiums during the run-off period and increasing claim severity, partially offset by reduced claim frequency and increased average earned premium as a result of rate increases. 
 Corporate and Other Adjusted Net Operating Loss increased by 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to increased overhead expenses, partially offset by increased investment income. 
 Revenues 
 Total Revenues decreased by 20.5 million to 1,178.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,199.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in earned premiums mostly driven by the run-off the Preferred Insurance business, partially offset by an increase from the absence of net realized losses on ultra-long treasury future derivative transactions recorded in 2023 and higher earned premiums within the Specialty Property Casualty Insurance segment due to higher new business volumes and higher average earned premium per exposure resulting from rate increases. 
 
 Earned Premiums decreased by 49.3 million to 1,068.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1,117.8 for the same period in 2023, primarily driven by 76.4 million in lower premiums from our Preferred Insurance business, reported as Non-Core Operations, due primarily to lower volumes resulting from the decision to exit and run-off the business in the third quarter of 2023 as well as ongoing profit improvement actions. The decrease was partially offset by a 28.6 million increase from the Specialty Property Casualty Insurance segment due to higher new business volumes and higher average earned premium per exposure resulting from rate increases. 
 Net Investment Income increased by 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to higher rate earned on Company-Owned Life Insurance and higher level of Short-term Investments, partially offset by lower levels of Fixed Income Securities. 
 Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) increased by 31.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to the absence of net realized losses on ultra-long treasury future derivative transactions recorded in 2023. 
 Total Revenues decreased by 305.2 million to 3,451.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,757.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in earned premiums, partially offset by an increase from the absence of net realized losses as described above. 
 
 Earned Premiums decreased by 331.5 million to 3,134.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,465.6 for the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a 181.3 million in lower premiums from our Preferred Insurance business, reported as Non-Core Operations, due primarily to lower volumes resulting from the decision to exit and run-off the business in the third quarter of 2023 as well as ongoing profit improvement actions. The decrease was also due to 145.3 million decrease from the Specialty Property Casualty Insurance segment due to lower business volumes resulting from targeted actions to improve profitability, partially offset by higher average earned premium per exposure resulting from rate increases. 
 Net Investment Income decreased by 10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, mostly driven by lower earnings from equity method securities, which included a 15.1 million loss from an investment valuation adjustment of one real estate investment in our alternative investment portfolio, and lower levels of fixed income securities, partially offset by higher levels of Short-term Investments.

Summary of Results (Continued)

 Net Investment Income was 304.5 million and 315.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net Investment Income decreased by 10.6 million in 2024 mostly driven by lower earnings from equity method securities, which included a 15.1 million loss from an investment valuation adjustment of one real estate investment in our alternative investment portfolio, and lower levels of fixed income securities, partially offset by higher levels of Short-term Investments. 
 Income and distributions on alternative investments can fluctuate significantly between periods as they are influenced by operating performance of the underlying investments, changes in market or economic conditions or the timing of asset sales.

 Impairment Losses 
 The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine whether a decline in the fair value of an investment has occurred from credit or other, non-credit related factors. If the decline in fair value is due to credit factors and the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to support the entire amortized cost basis, the credit loss is reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) in the period that the declines are evaluated. Conversely, an increase in the fair value or disposal of an investment with a previously established credit allowance will result in the reversal of impairment losses reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) in the period.

The Company repurchased approximately 25.0 million in 2024 so that, as of September 30, 2024, the remaining share repurchase authorization was 146.6 million under the repurchase program. The amount and timing of any future share repurchases under the authorization will depend on various factors, including market conditions, the Company s financial condition, results of operations, available liquidity, particular circumstances and other considerations. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 Kemper repurchased and retired approximately 400,000 shares of its common stock under its share repurchase authorization for an aggregate cost of 25.0 million and an average cost per share of 61.21.

 Subsidiary Dividends 
 Various insurance laws restrict the ability of Kemper s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends without regulatory approval. Such insurance laws applicable to the Company s US based insurance subsidiaries generally restrict the amount of dividends paid in an annual period to the greater of statutory net income from the previous year or 10 of statutory capital and surplus. Kemper s insurance subsidiaries paid 200.0 million of dividends to Kemper during the first nine months of 2024. Kemper s US based insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay without prior regulatory approval is estimated to be 13.3 million as of the filing date. 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 The Company directly held cash and investments totaling 503.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 464.5 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 The primary sources of funds available for repayment of Kemper s indebtedness, repurchases of common stock, future shareholder dividend payments, and the payment of interest on Kemper s senior notes, include cash and investments directly held by Kemper, receipt of dividends from Kemper s insurance subsidiaries and borrowings under the credit agreement and from subsidiaries. 
 The primary sources of funds for Kemper s insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment income, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments, advances from the FHLBs of Chicago and Dallas, and capital contributions from Kemper. The primary uses of funds are the payment of policyholder benefits under life insurance contracts, claims under property and casualty insurance contracts and accident and health insurance contracts, the payment of commissions and general expenses, the purchase of investments and repayments of advances from the FHLBs of Chicago and Dallas. 
 Generally, there is a time lag between when premiums are collected and when policyholder benefits and insurance claims are paid. During periods of growth, property and casualty insurance companies typically experience positive operating cash flows and can invest a portion of their operating cash flows to fund future policyholder benefits and claims. During periods in which premium revenues decline, insurance companies may experience negative cash flows from operations and may need to sell

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued) 
 investments to fund payments to policyholders and claimants. In addition, if the Company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may be sold to fund payments, which could result in investment gains or losses. Management believes that its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries maintain adequate levels of liquidity in the event that they were to experience several future catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time. 
 Information about the Company s cash flows for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented below. 
 (Dollars in Millions) Sep 30, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 207.8 (104.5) Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities (89.6) 105.2 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities (125.4) (100.7) 
 Cash available for investment activities is dependent on cash flow from Operating Activities and Financing Activities and the level of cash the Company elects to maintain. 
 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by Operating Activities was 207.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used of 104.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by Operating Activities was primarily driven by increased net income as a result of rate increases, lower paid claims due to lower frequency, and timing of payments within our Property and Casualty operations. Additionally, cash from operations for 2023 included a 124.7 million federal income tax refund received. 
 
 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in Investing Activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 89.6 million, compared to net cash provided of 105.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in cash provided by Investing Activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the ongoing management of our investment portfolio that was impacted by timing of claim payments and premium collections from our Property and Casualty operations. 
 
 Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in Financing Activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 125.4 million, compared to net cash used of 100.7 million for the same period in 2023, an increase in cash used of 24.7 million. This was primarily due to a common share stock repurchases. Kemper used 25.0 million of cash to repurchase shares of its common stock during 2024. Kemper did not use any cash to repurchase shares of its common stock during 2023. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Kemper s subsidiaries conduct their operations in two industries: property and casualty insurance and life insurance. Accordingly, the Company is subject to several industry-specific accounting principles under GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The process of estimation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results could ultimately differ materially from the estimated amounts reported in a company s financial statements. Different assumptions are likely to result in different estimates of reported amounts. 
 The Company s critical accounting policies most sensitive to estimates include the valuation of investments, the valuation of life insurance reserves, the valuation of reserves for property and casualty insurance incurred losses and LAE, the assessment of recoverability of goodwill, and the recoverability of deferred tax assets. The Company s critical accounting policies are described in the MD A included in the 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to the information disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report with respect to these critical accounting estimates and the Company s significant accounting policies.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Based on such evaluation, Kemper s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by Kemper in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including Kemper s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
