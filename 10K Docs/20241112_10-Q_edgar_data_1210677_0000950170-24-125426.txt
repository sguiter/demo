reportable segments, Americas and International. Our chief operating decision maker CODM uses the profit measure of Adjusted EBITDA, on both a consolidated and a segment basis, to allocate resources and assess performance of our businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our profit measure because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of operating performance, which is useful to compare operating results between periods. Our CODM also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure for both segment and corporate management under our incentive compensation plans. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and as further adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, transaction and acquisition-related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other non-cash charges. We exclude the impact of share-based compensation because it is a non-cash expense and we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding performance and ongoing cash generation potential. We exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, transaction and acquisition related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other charges because such expenses are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. The segment financial information below aligns with how we report information to our CODM to assess operating performance and how the Company manages the business. Corporate costs are generally allocated to the segments based upon estimated revenue levels and other assumptions that management considers reasonable. The CODM does not review the Company s assets by segment; therefore, such information is not presented. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9, Revenues. The following is a description of our two reportable segments: Americas. This segment performs a variety of background check and compliance services across all phases of the workforce lifecycle from pre-onboarding services to post-onboarding and ongoing monitoring services, covering employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our service offerings into three categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products. We deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. International. The International segment provides services similar to our Americas segment in regions outside of the Americas. We primarily deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the Europe, India, and Asia Pacific.

 Overview 
 First Advantage is a leading global provider of employment background screening, identity, and verification solutions. Enabled by its proprietary technology, First Advantage delivers innovative services and insights that help customers mitigate risk and hire the best talent: employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. 
 Our comprehensive product suite includes criminal background checks, drug / health screening, extended workforce screening, biometrics and identity, education / work verifications, resident screening, fleet / driver compliance, executive screening, data analytics, continuous monitoring, social media monitoring, and hiring tax incentives. We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from pre-onboarding screening and perform screens in over 200 countries and territories, enabling us to serve as a one-stop-shop provider to both multinational companies and growth companies. Our more than 30,000 customers are global enterprises, mid-sized companies, and small companies, and our products and solutions are used by personnel in recruiting, human resources, risk, compliance, vendor management, safety, and/or security. 
 Our products are sold both individually and packaged. The First Advantage platform offers flexibility for customers to specify which products to include in their screening package, such as Social Security numbers, criminal records, education and work verifications, sex offender registry, and global sanctions. Generally, our customers order a background screening package or selected combination of screens related to a single individual before they onboard that individual. The type and mix of products and solutions we sell to a customer vary by customer size, their screening requirements, and industry vertical. Therefore, order volumes are not comparable across both customers and periods. Pricing can also vary considerably by customer depending on the product mix in their screening packages, order volumes, screening requirements and preferences, and pass-through and third-party out of pocket costs. 
 20 

We enter into contracts with our customers that are typically three years in length. These contracts set forth the general terms and pricing of our products and solutions but generally do not include minimum order volumes or committed order volumes. Accordingly, contracts do not provide guarantees of future revenues. Due to our contract terms and the nature of the background screening industry, we determined our contract terms for ASC 606 purposes are less than one year. We typically bill our customers at the end of each month and recognize revenues as completed orders are reported or otherwise made available to our customers. Approximately 90 of our criminal searches performed in the United States in 2023 were completed the same day they were submitted. 
 We generated revenues of 199.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 200.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and generated revenues of 553.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 561.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Approximately 87 of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generated in the Americas, predominantly in the United States, while the remaining 13 was generated internationally. Other than the United States, no single country accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Please refer to Results of Operations for further details. 
 Segments 
 We manage our business and report our financial results in two reportable segments, Americas and International: 
 Americas. This segment performs a variety of background check and compliance services across all phases of the workforce lifecycle from pre-onboarding services to post-onboarding and ongoing monitoring services, covering employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our service offerings into three categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products. We deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. 

International. The International segment provides services similar to our Americas segment in regions outside of the Americas. We primarily deliver our solutions across multiple industry verticals in the Europe, India, and Asia Pacific. 

Seasonality 
 We experience seasonality with respect to certain industries due to fluctuations in hiring volumes and other economic activity. For example, pre-onboarding revenues generated from our customers in the retail and transportation industries are historically highest during the months of October and November, leading up to the U.S. holiday season and lowest in December and at the beginning of the new year, following the U.S. holiday hiring season. Certain customers across various industries also historically increase their hiring throughout the second quarter of the year as winter concludes, commercial activity tied to outdoor activities increases, and the school year ends, giving rise to student and graduate hiring. We expect that further growth in e-commerce, the continued digital transformation of the economy, and other economic forces may impact future seasonality, but we are unable to predict these potential shifts and how our business may be impacted. 
 Recent Developments 
 Acquisition of Sterling Check Corp. 
 On February 28, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), by and among First Advantage, Sterling Check Corp., a Delaware corporation Sterling ), and Starter Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of First Advantage Merger Sub ). 
 On October 31, 2024, following the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable closing conditions, including receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, First Advantage completed its acquisition of Sterling, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, merged with and into Sterling, with Sterling continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger and becoming an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of First Advantage. The Sterling stockholders received approximately 1,224.6 million in cash and 27.15 million shares of First Advantage common stock with a fair value of 507.7 million. We believe the transaction extends First Advantage s high-quality and cost-effective background screening, identity, and verification technology solutions for the benefit of both companies' customers across industry verticals and geographies. The cash-and-stock transaction values Sterling at approximately 2.2 billion and was financed through cash on hand and the issuance of new debt and common stock. See Note 6, Long-term Debt, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.

Current Economic Conditions 
 Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rates, consumer spending, variability in hiring activity and job openings, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have negatively impacted significant portions of the global economy, and created volatility in the financial markets. 
 If the economic uncertainty is sustained or increases, we may experience a negative impact on new business, customer renewals and demand levels, sales and marketing efforts, revenue growth rates, customer deployments, customer collections, product development, or other financial metrics. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Despite the continuing uncertainty associated with these conditions, we are confident in the overall long-term health of our business, the strength of our product offerings, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy and help our customers hire smarter and onboard faster. Our ability to deliver innovative products and solutions that enhance workplace safety and address compliance risks has contributed to the durability of our financial results. For additional information, see our Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Components of our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 The Company derives revenues from a variety of background screening and adjacent products that cover all phases of the workforce lifecycle from pre-onboarding screening services to post-onboarding and ongoing monitoring services, covering employees, contractors, contingent workers, tenants, and drivers. We generally classify our products and solutions into three major categories: pre-onboarding, post-onboarding, and adjacent products, each of which is enabled by our technology, proprietary internal databases, and data analytics capabilities. Pre-onboarding products, which comprise the substantial majority of our revenues, span an extensive array of products that customers typically utilize to enhance their applicant evaluation process and help ensure compliance with their workforce onboarding criteria from the time an application is submitted to an applicant s successful onboarding. Post-onboarding products are comprised of continuous monitoring, re-screening, and other solutions to help our customers keep their end customers, workforces, and other stakeholders safer, more productive, and more compliant. Adjacent products include products that complement our pre-onboarding and post-onboarding solutions such as fleet / vehicle compliance, hiring tax credits and incentives, resident / tenant screening, employment eligibility, and investigative research. 
 Our suite of products is available individually or through packaged solutions that can be configured and tailored according to our customers needs. We typically bill our customers at the end of each month and recognize revenues after completed orders are reported or otherwise made available to our customers, with a substantial majority of our customers orders completed the same day they are submitted. We recognize revenues for other products over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the products and solutions delivered. 
 22 

Operating Expenses 
 We incur the following expenses related to our cost of revenues and operating expenses: 
 Cost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization below) : Consists of amounts paid to third parties for access to government records, other third-party data and services, and our internal processing fulfillment and customer care functions. In addition, cost of services includes expenses from our drug screening lab and collection site network as well as our court runner network. Third-party cost of services are largely variable in nature and are typically invoiced to our customers as direct pass-through costs. Cost of services also includes our salaries and benefits expense for personnel involved in the processing and fulfillment of our screening products and solutions, as well as our customer care organization and robotics process automation implementation team. Other costs included in cost of services relate to allocations of certain overhead costs for our revenue-generating products and solutions, primarily consisting of certain facility costs and administrative services allocated by headcount or another related metric. We do not allocate depreciation and amortization to cost of services. 

Product and Technology Expense : Consists of salaries and benefits of personnel involved in the maintenance of our technology and its integrations and APIs, product marketing, management of our network and infrastructure capabilities, and maintenance of our information security and business continuity functions. A portion of the personnel costs are related to the development of new products and features that are primarily developed through agile methodologies. These costs are partially capitalized, and therefore, are partially reflected as amortization expense within the depreciation and amortization cost line item. Product and technology expense also includes third-party costs related to our cloud computing services, software licensing and maintenance, telecommunications, and other data processing functions. We do not allocate depreciation and amortization to product and technology expense. 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense : Consists of sales, customer success, marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Sales, customer success, and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation such as salaries, bonuses, sales commissions, share-based compensation, and other employee benefits for our verticalized sales and customer success teams. General and administrative expenses include travel expenses and various corporate functions including finance, human resources, legal, and other administrative roles, in addition to certain professional service fees and expenses incurred in connection with our IPO and our acquisition of Sterling. We expect our selling, general, and administrative expenses to increase in the short-term, primarily as a result of additional public company related reporting and compliance costs. Over the long-term, we expect our selling, general, and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage our past investments. We do not allocate depreciation and amortization to selling, general, and administrative expenses. 

Depreciation and Amortizatio n: Property and equipment consisting mainly of capitalized software costs, furniture, hardware, and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized and reflected as operating expenses. We also amortize the capitalized costs of finite-life intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations. 

We have a flexible cost structure that allows our business to adjust quickly to the impacts of macroeconomic events and scale to meet the needs of large new customers. Operating expenses are influenced by the amount of revenues, customer mix, and product mix that contribute to our revenues for any given period. As revenues grow, we would generally expect cost of services to grow in a similar fashion, albeit influenced by the effects of automation, productivity, and other efficiency initiatives as well as customer and product mix shifts and third-party pass-through costs. We regularly review expenses and investments in the context of revenues growth and any shifts we identify in the business in order to align with our overall financial objectives. While we expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars to support our continued growth, we believe that, in the long term, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decline gradually in the future as our business grows and our operating efficiency and automation initiatives continue to advance. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Our other expense, net consists of interest expense, net. Interest expense, net relates primarily to our debt service costs, the interest-related unrealized gains and losses of our interest rate derivative instruments and, to a lesser extent, the interest on our capital lease obligations and the amortization of deferred financing costs. Additionally, interest expense, net includes interest income earnings on our cash and cash equivalent balances held in interest-bearing accounts. We also earn interest income on our short-term investments which are fixed-time deposits having a maturity date within twelve months. 
 23 

Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists of domestic and foreign corporate income taxes related to earnings from our sale of services, with statutory tax rates that differ by jurisdiction. Our effective tax rate may be affected by many other factors including changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, shifts in the allocation of income earned throughout the world, and changes in overall levels of income before tax. 
 In accordance with ASC 740-270, Interim Reporting , at the end of each interim period, the Company is required to determine the best estimate of its annual effective tax rate and then apply that rate in providing for income taxes on an interim period. However, in certain circumstances where the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, ASC 740-270 allows the actual effective tax rate for the interim period to be used. As of September 30, 2024, the Company calculated its effective rate and applied that rate to the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company used this approach because it was unable to reasonably estimate its annual effective rate due to the variability of the rate as a result of small changes in forecasted income and fluctuations in annual pre-tax income and loss between quarters.

Revenues were 199.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 200.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.2 million, or 0.6 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a net decrease of 9.3 million, or 4.7 , in existing customer revenues, primarily driven by the impact of macroeconomic factors affecting the hiring industry, particularly in our Americas segment, which have resulted in reduced demand from our customers and the impact of lost accounts. These consolidated decreases were partially offset by ongoing strength in upselling and cross-selling incremental services to existing customers, contributing 14.7 million, or 7.3 , of additional revenues. 
 The decrease in existing customer revenues was further offset by: 
 revenues of 5.8 million, or 2.9 , from new customers, primarily attributable to our Americas segment; and 

revenues of 2.3 million, or 1.1 , attributable to the Infinite ID acquisition in the Americas segment. 

Revenues were 553.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 561.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 8.1 million, or 1.4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a net decrease of 39.0 million, or 7.0 , in existing customer revenues, primarily driven by the impact of macroeconomic factors affecting the hiring industry which have resulted in reduced demand from our customers and the impact of lost accounts. These consolidated decreases were partially offset by ongoing strength in upselling and cross-selling to existing customers, contributing 31.0 million, or 5.5 , of additional revenues, and increased revenues from certain existing customers that were impacted by macroeconomic conditions, to a lesser extent, as compared to other existing customers. 
 The decrease in existing customer revenues was further offset by: 
 revenues of 22.5 million, or 4.0 , from new customers, primarily attributable to our Americas segment; and 

revenues of 8.4 million, or 1.5 , attributable to the Infinite ID acquisition in the Americas segment. 

Pricing remained relatively stable across all periods.

Key Operating and Financial Metrics 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe certain measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation, and to compare our performance against that of peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. 
 The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a strong indicator of our overall operating performance and is useful to management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and as further adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, transaction and acquisition-related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other non-cash charges. We exclude the impact of share-based compensation because it is a non-cash expense and we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding performance and ongoing cash generation potential. We exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, transaction and acquisition related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other charges because such expenses are episodic in nature and have no direct correlation to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 64.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and represented an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 32.2 . Adjusted EBITDA was 64.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and represented an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 32.3 . Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.7 million, or 1.1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 166.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and represented an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 30.1 . Adjusted EBITDA was 169.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and represented an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 30.2 . Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 3.0 million, or 1.7 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as macroeconomic events impacted our revenues attributed to existing customers. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from certain existing and new customers, including ongoing strength in upselling and cross-selling, cost structure benefits due to increased automation, operational efficiencies, and certain other cost savings actions taken by the Company.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 
 Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are strong indicators of our overall operating performance and are useful to our management and investors as measures of comparative operating performance from period to period. We define Adjusted Net Income for a particular period as net (loss) income before taxes adjusted for debt-related costs, acquisition-related depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, transaction and acquisition related charges, integration and restructuring charges, and other non-cash charges, to which we then apply the related effective tax rate. We define Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by adjusted weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted. 
 Adjusted Net Income was 38.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted Net Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 2.0 million, or 5.1 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share was 0.26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.28 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.02, or 7.1 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted Net Income was 93.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 103.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted Net Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 9.7 million, or 9.4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share was 0.64 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.71 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.07, or 9.9 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share declined during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as reduced demand from customers more impacted by macroeconomic events contributed to lower revenues and profitability. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were further impacted by changes in acquisition-related depreciation and amortization and changes in our capital structure that are captured in interest expense. Gains or losses and actual cash payments and receipts on the Company s interest rate swaps impact the comparability of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share across historical periods. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is further impacted by shares repurchased under the Company s Repurchase Program.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 The Company s primary liquidity requirements are for working capital, continued investments in software development and other capital expenditures, and other strategic investments, including the Acquisition. In 2023, the Company fully utilized its remaining U.S. Federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, income taxes are and will be a material use of funds, depending on our future profitability, and future tax rates. The Company s liquidity needs are met primarily through existing balance sheet cash, cash flows from operations, as well as funds available under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our term loan borrowings, including incremental term loan borrowings incurred to fund the Acquisition pursuant to commitment letters entered into with certain financial institutions. Our cash flows from operations include cash received from customers, less cash costs to provide services to our customers, which includes general and administrative costs and interest payments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 307.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 100.0 million available under our revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had 564.7 million of total debt outstanding. As a result of the refinancing related to the acquisition of Sterling, the Company will have 2.185 billion of total debt outstanding and 250.0 million available under our revolving credit facility. The debt balance outstanding requires 1 annual prepayments, to be made quarterly. Additionally, the Company used approximately 230 million of its cash and cash equivalents to fund the acquisition of Sterling and related expenses and expects cash and cash equivalents from Sterling after close to be approximately 55 million, resulting in a consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance after close of more than 125 million. 
 We believe our cash on hand, together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility, and cash provided by operating activities are and will continue to be adequate to meet our operational and business needs in the next twelve months. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds. In the event that we need access to additional cash, we may not be able to access the credit markets on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to fund future operating expenses and capital expenditures and our ability to meet future debt service obligations or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, and other factors that may be beyond our control, including those described under our Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 On August 2, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50.0 million of the Company s common stock over the 12-month period ending August 2, 2023 (the Repurchase Program ). Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases at prevailing market prices, including through the use of block trades and trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, privately-negotiated transactions, through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, or a combination of these methods on such terms and in such amounts as the Company deems appropriate and will be funded from available capital. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing, manner, value, and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company s stock price and liquidity requirements, other business considerations and general market and economic conditions. No shares will be purchased from SLP Fastball Aggregator, L.P. and its affiliates. The Company may discontinue or modify purchases without notice at any time. The Company has used and plans to use its existing cash to fund repurchases made under the share repurchase program. 
 On November 8, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an increase to the total available amount under its Repurchase Program to 150.0 million and extended the program through December 31, 2023. On February 28, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized an increase to the total available amount under its Repurchase Program to 200.0 million. On September 14, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a one-year extension of its share repurchase authorization, extending the previously authorized 200.0 million program through December 31, 2024. Through November 8, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 119.5 million of shares under the Repurchase Program. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company suspended purchases under its Repurchase Program. 
 Dividends 
 On August 8, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors declared a one-time special cash dividend of 1.50 per share to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 21, 2023. Since August 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024, the Company has paid an aggregate cash dividend of 218.0 million with cash from the balance sheet. 
 33 

Long-Term Debt 
 In February 2020, a new financing structure was established, which included a new First Lien Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provided financing in the form of a 670.0 million term loan due January 31, 2027 First Lien Credit Facility and a 75.0 million new revolving credit facility due January 31, 2025 Revolver ). 
 On February 1, 2021, we amended the First Lien Agreement to fund 100.0 million of additional first lien term loans and reduce the applicable margins by 0.25 . 
 In connection with its IPO, the Company entered into an amendment to increase the borrowing capacity under the Revolver from 75.0 million to 100.0 million and extend the maturity date from January 31, 2025 to July 31, 2026. 
 Borrowings under the First Lien Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate or (b) LIBOR, which is subject to a floor of 0.00 per annum. Pursuant to an amendment in June 2023, the reference rate under the Credit Agreement was transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), with the addition of an applicable margin. The applicable margins under the First Lien Agreement are subject to stepdowns based on our first lien net leverage ratio. In connection with the closing of the IPO, each applicable margin was reduced further by 0.25 . In addition, the borrower, First Advantage Holdings, LLC, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is required to pay a commitment fee on any unutilized commitments under the revolving credit facility. The commitment fee rate ranges between 0.25 and 0.50 per annum based on our first lien net leverage ratio. The borrower is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees. 
 The First Lien Credit Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00 of the principal amount. The Revolver has no amortization. The First Lien Credit Facility requires the borrower to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with certain proceeds from non-ordinary course asset sales, issuance of debt not permitted by the credit agreement to be incurred and annual excess cash flows. In addition, any voluntary prepayment of term loans in connection with certain repricing transactions on or prior to August 1, 2021 were subject to a 1.00 prepayment premium. Otherwise, the borrower may voluntarily repay outstanding loans without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs. 
 In connection with the closing of the IPO, on June 30, 2021, the Company repaid 200.0 million of the First Lien Credit Facility outstanding, of which 44.3 million was applied to all of the remaining quarterly amortizing principal payments due under the First Lien Agreement. The remaining 564.7 million term loan is scheduled to mature on January 31, 2027. 
 The First Lien Agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by Fastball Parent, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the direct parent of the borrower, and material wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries of Fastball Parent, Inc. The First Lien Agreement and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by (1) a first priority security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and the guarantors and (2) a first-priority pledge of 100 of the capital stock of the borrower and of each wholly-owned material restricted subsidiary of the borrower and the guarantors (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, does not include more than 65 of the voting stock of such non-U.S. subsidiary). 
 The First Lien Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants, and events of default (including upon a change of control). The First Lien Agreement also includes a springing first lien net leverage ratio test, applicable only to the Revolver, that requires such ratio to be no greater than 7.75:1.00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter if more than 35.0 of the Revolver is utilized on such date. 
 In connection with the acquisition of Sterling, on October 31, 2024, First Advantage Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower ), refinanced its existing First Lien Credit Agreement and all related Sterling debt. See Note 6, Long-term Debt, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.

Cash Flow Analysis 
 Comparison of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table is a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 

(in thousands) 
 
 2024 

2023 

Net cash provided by operating activities 

113,862 

106,080 

Net cash used in investing activities 

(21,716) 

(61,932) 

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 

1,155 

(270,565) 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 113.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 106.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 7.8 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by the timing of payments of professional service and legal fees related to the Company s acquisition of Sterling and the continuation of more modest hiring activity from our customers resulting from the current hiring environment. This was offset in part by lower accounts receivable driven by increased cash collections from customers. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 61.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 40.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to the 41.1 million Infinite ID acquisition, net of cash acquired and other transaction adjustments, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, slightly offset by increased spend on software development. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to (270.6) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by cash net inflows related to share-based compensation activity. These inflows were offset by cash outflows related to payments on the deferred purchase of a software platform and dividends paid on vested RSUs as a result of the Company s August 2023 one-time special dividend. Net cash used in financing activities for nine months ended September 30, 2023 were impacted by the Company s one-time special cash dividend of 1.50 per share to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 21, 2023 and shares repurchased under the Company s Repurchase Program. An aggregate cash dividend of 217.7 million was paid on August 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 4,140,519 shares for a total cost of 55.9 million. These outflows were offset partially by cash inflows related to share-based compensation activity.
