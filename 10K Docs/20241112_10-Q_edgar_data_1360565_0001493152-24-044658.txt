Seasonality 

Our
business is subject to seasonal fluctuations annually. Significant portions of our verification and certification service revenue are
typically realized during late May through early October when the calf marketings and the growing seasons are at their peak. 

Additionally,
the cattle industry is cyclical by nature based on factors impacting current and future supplies such as drought-induced feedlot placements,
higher cow and heifer slaughter, and lower auction receipts. The production lags inherent to this industry lead to long-lasting impacts
of production decisions. For example, increased liquidation implies tighter supplies for next year. Similarly, times of herd expansion
are typically a multi-year period. These cycles typically last roughly 10 years. The current cycle began in 2014, and we believe we are
currently in the contraction phase of the cycle after peaking in 2018-2019. How long we continue to contract will be directly impacted
by drought, pasture conditions, supply and demand. 

Because
of the seasonality of the business and cyclical nature of our industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification is the sole source of authoritative GAAP other than SEC
issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) to communicate
changes to the codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASU s. 

In
March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Scope Application of Profits Interest and
Similar Awards, to improve GAAP by adding an illustrative example to demonstrate how an entity should apply the scope guidance in paragraph
718-10-15-3 to determine whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718, Compensation
 Stock Compensation. The Company will be required to adopt the changes effective January 1, 2025. The standard is not expected
to impact the Company s financial statements. 

In
March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements.
The FASB as a standing project on its agenda to facilitate Codification updates for technical corrections such as conforming amendments,
clarifications to guidance, simplifications to working or the structure of guidance, and other minor improvements. The Company will be
required to adopt the changes effective January 1, 2025. At this time, management is determining the extent of changes to the disclosures
on its financial statements.

Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, contained in the Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion
and analysis includes historical and certain forward looking information that should be read together with the accompanying consolidated

Business
Overview 

Where
Food Comes From, Inc. and its subsidiaries WFCF, the Company, our, we, or us is a leading trusted resource for third-party verification of food production practices in North America. The Company estimates that
is supports more than approximately 17,500 farmers, ranchers, vineyards, wineries, processors, retailers, distributors, trade associations,
consumer brands, chefs and restaurants with a wide variety of value-added services provided through its family of verifiers, including
IMI Global IMI ), Where Food Comes From Organic WFCFO - previously International Certification Services
and A Bee Organic), and Validus Verification Services Validus ). In order to have credibility, product claims such as gluten-free,
non-GMO, non-hormone treated, humane handling, and others require verification by an independent third-party such as WFCF. The Company s
principal business is conducting both on-site and desk audits to verify that claims being made about livestock, aquaculture, crops and
other food products are accurate. 

Through
SureHarvest Services LLC SureHarvest and Postelsia Holdings, Ltd. Postelsia ), we primarily provide a wide
range of professional services and technology solutions that generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry
and drive sustainable value creation. 

Finally,
the Company s Where Food Comes From Source Verified retail and restaurant labeling program utilizes the verification of product
attributes to connect consumers directly to the source of the food they purchase through product labeling and web-based information sharing
and education. With the use of Quick Response Code QR technology, consumers can instantly access information about the
producers behind their food. 

WFCF
was founded in 1996 and incorporated in the state of Colorado as a subchapter C corporation in 2006. The Company s shares of common
stock trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market NASDAQ ), under the stock ticker symbol, WFCF. 

The
Company s original name Integrated Management Information, Inc. (d.b.a. IMI Global) was changed to Where Food Comes
From, Inc. in 2012 to better reflect the Company s mission. Early growth was attributable to source and age verification services
for beef producers that wanted access to markets overseas following the discovery of mad cow disease in the U.S. Over the
years, WFCF has expanded its portfolio to include verification and professional services for most food groups and over 50 programs and
organizations. This growth has been achieved both organically and through the acquisition of other companies. 

Pandemics,
the Inflationary Environment and other Weather Related Risks 

We
continue to monitor risks related to pandemics, inflation and weather, as well as other risks closely and will react accordingly, while
keeping the interest of our customers, employees and shareholders in mind. Please refer to our risk factors included in our Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information related to all of our risks.

Environmental,
Social and Governance ESG and Human Capital Resources 

ESG 

We
take environmental and social responsibility very seriously. It s the entire reason we spend day in and day out helping farmers,
ranchers and brands around the world provide transparency to their consumers. Communicating authentic, sustainable, and traceable stories
directly impacts our future. 

We
believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve
a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its
affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics. Our internal ESG Council is made up of leaders from across our company, and
regularly presents to our Executive Team, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives, and priorities. 

Human
Capital Resources 

Our
greatest asset is our people, and we continue to attract the best and brightest with our competitive pay and benefits package. As of
September 30, 2024, we had 104 total employees, of which 94 were full-time employees. Approximately 84 of our workforce is comprised
of female and other minority employees. 

We
are committed to providing a workplace where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Our Human Resource department HR conducts a new hire orientation, so employees know whom to contact with questions or concerns. HR has an open door policy and is actively
involved in driving culture and engagement alongside business leaders. 

Our
policies are designed to promote fairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate, and promote employees based on their skills and
performance. Everyone is expected to be trustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance, and collaborate with others. With this
in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These include harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation, and discrimination of
any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age,
disability or veteran status. 

To
continue innovating, we must ensure we have a talented and engaged workforce with ample opportunity to contribute to our mission and
grow professionally. We are focused on intentionally creating pathways to career opportunities across WFCF through strategic initiatives
such as internships and leadership training. 

At
WFCF, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. With a majority-minority workforce,
empowering our employee resource groups to take charge in driving initiatives that attract, develop, and retain our passionate workforce
is vital to our continued success. 

Seasonality 

Our
business is subject to seasonal fluctuations annually. Significant portions of our verification and certification service revenue is
typically realized during late May through early October when the calf marketings and the growing seasons are at their peak. 

Additionally,
the cattle industry is cyclical by nature based on factors impacting current and future supplies such as drought-induced feedlot placements,
higher cow and heifer slaughter, and lower auction receipts. The production lags inherent to this industry lead to long-lasting impacts
of production decisions. For example, increased liquidation implies tighter supplies for next year. Similarly, times of herd expansion
are typically a multi-year period. These cycles typically last roughly 10 years. The current cycle began in 2014 and we believe we are
currently in the contraction phase of the cycle after peaking in 2018-2019. How long we continue to contract will be directly impacted
by drought, pasture conditions, supply and demand. 

Because
of the seasonality of the business and cyclical nature of our industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 

20 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 2.8 million and 2.6 million, respectively.
Our working capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately 2.2 million and 3.2 million, respectively. 

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 2.8 million compared to 2.6 million
during the same period in 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income and adjusted by non-cash items.
Non-cash adjustments primarily include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred
taxes. Fluctuations are primarily due to operating performance offset by the timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements. The increase
in cash provided by operating activities for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily driven by a change in accrued
expenses and other current liabilities, prepaid expenses and other assets, and deferred revenue. 

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.1 million compared to 0.3 million
in the 2023 period. Net cash used in the period ending September 30, 2023 was primarily related to our equity investment in BlueTrace. 

Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 2.5 million and 2.9 million,
respectively. Cash used for the period ending nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a private purchase of our common
shares and the repurchase of common shares under the Stock Buyback Plan. Cash used for the period ending September 30, 2023, was primarily
due to the repurchase of common shares under the Stock Buyback Plan. 

Over
the past several years, our growth has been funded primarily through cash flows from operations. We continually evaluate all funding
options, including additional offerings of our securities to private, public and institutional investors and other credit facilities
as they become available. 

The
primary driver of our operating cash flow is our third-party verification solutions, specifically the gross margin generated from services
provided. Therefore, we focus on the elements of those operations, including revenue growth, gross margin and long-term projects that
ensure a steady stream of operating profits to enable us to meet our cash obligations. On a weekly basis, we review the performance of
each of our revenue streams focusing on third-party verification solutions compared with prior periods and our operating plan. We believe
that our various sources of capital, including cash flow from operating activities, overall improvement in our performance, and our ability
to obtain additional financing, are adequate to finance current operations. We are not aware of any other event or trend that would negatively
affect our liquidity. In the event such a trend develops, we believe that there are sufficient financing avenues available to us and
from our internal cash-generating capabilities to adequately manage our ongoing business. 

The
culmination of all our efforts has brought significant opportunities to us, including increased investor
confidence and renewed interest in our company, as well as the potential to develop business relationships with long-term strategic
partners. In keeping with our core business, we will continue to review our business model with a focus on profitability, long-term capital
solutions and the potential impact of acquisitions or divestitures, if such an opportunity arises. 

Our
plan for continued growth is primarily based on diversification and bundling opportunities in our product offerings within national and
international markets, as well as, potential acquisitions. We believe that there are significant growth opportunities available to us
because of growing consumer awareness and demand on a national level. Internationally, a quality verification program is often the only
way to overcome import or export restrictions.

Verification
and Certification Segment 

Verification
and certification service revenues consist of fees charged for verification audits and other verification and certification related services
that the Company performs for customers. Fees earned from our WFCF labeling program are also included in our verification and certification
revenues as it represents a value-added extension of our source verification. We are recognized and utilized by numerous standard-setting
bodies as an accredited verification or certification service provider. We enable food producers and brands to make certain claims on
live animals or packaged food products by verifying that they are meeting the standards or guidelines associated with the claim(s) they
are making. Verification and certification service revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.4 and
8.8 , respectively, compared with the same periods in 2023. While our verification and certification service revenue continues to improve
due to new customer growth and bundling opportunities, we believe we are in a low point of a contraction phase within the cattle cycle
which negatively impacts revenue tied directly to price per head of cattle. 

23 

Our
product sales are an ancillary part of our verification and certification services and represent sales of cattle identification ear tags.
Product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 slightly increased 0.1 million, compared to the same period in 2023. Product
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.3 million, compared to the same period in 2023. We continue to see some
new customer growth, but our customers are ordering less tags due to smaller beef cow herd size. According to the USDA July 2023 statistics,
overall beef cow inventories have declined over 3 compared to last year. As mentioned above, we believe we are at a low point of a contraction
phase within the cattle cycle which negatively impacts revenue tied directly to price per head of cattle. 

Segment
costs of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 4.1 million and 10.6 million, respectively,
compared to approximately 3.8 million and 9.9 million, respectively for the same periods in 2023. Gross margin for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 39.4 and 42.2 , respectively, while the gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 was 41.4 and 42.3 , respectively. The slight decline was primarily driven by higher cost of product sales overset by higher
margin verification services. Our margins are generally impacted by various fixed costs such as cost of products, salaries and benefits,
insurance and taxes. 

Other
operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 0.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively,
compared to the same three and nine month periods in 2023. Some of the increase was due to costs incurred to expand our marketing efforts
both nationally and internationally. Additionally, some year-end audit and tax return preparation fees were incurred during the third
quarter of 2024 versus the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Professional
Services Segment 

Professional
services includes a wide range of professional consulting, data analysis, reporting and technology solutions that support our verification
business and generate incremental revenue specific to the food and agricultural industry. Professional services revenue for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased approximately 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, compared to the same periods
in 2023. 

Costs
of revenues for our professional services segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 0.2 million
and 0.7 million, respectively, compared to approximately 0.3 million and 1.0 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023.
Gross margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 30.1 and 27.4 , respectively, compared to 20.9 and
22.6 for the same periods in 2023, as a result of realigning employees tasks to more profitable areas of focus. 

Dividend
Income from Progressive Beef 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, the Company received dividend income from Progressive Beef of 50,000 and 150,000, respectively,
representing a distribution of their earnings. 

Income
Tax Expense 

The
provision for income taxes is recorded at the end of each interim period based on the Company s best estimate of its effective
income tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we recorded
an income tax expense of approximately 0.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023 we recorded an income tax expense of approximately 0.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively. 

Net
Income and Per Share Information 

As
a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to WFCF shareholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately
 0.5 million and 1.2 million, respectively, and 0.09 and 0.22, respectively, per basic share common share and 0.09 and 0.21 per
diluted common share. Compared to net income of approximately 0.7 million and 1.4 million, respectively, and 0.13 and 0.25, respectively,
per basic share and 0.13 and 0.24, respectively, per diluted common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, including our principal executive and financial officers, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Exchange Act, to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that
evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
the end of the period covered by this report. We believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all
material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
and can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

There
have not been any other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
