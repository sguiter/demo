per annum of its average daily net assets. UVIX pays the Sponsor a
Management Fee, monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to per annum of its average daily net assets. Average daily
net assets is calculated by dividing the month-end net assets of each Fund by the number of calendar days in such month. 

No other Management Fee is paid by the Funds. The
Management Fee is paid in consideration of the Sponsor s trading advisory services and the other services provided to the Fund that
the Sponsor pays directly. 

Prior to September 16, 2024, Penserra Capital Management
LLC (the Penserra served as the Funds commodity sub-adviser. During the period in which Penserra served as the commodity
sub-adviser, the Sponsor oversaw and paid Penserra for its services as commodity sub-adviser, based on each Fund s average daily
net assets (total assets of the Fund, minus the sum of its accrued liabilities). The Funds did not directly pay Penserra. 

Non-Recurring Fees and Expenses 

Each Fund pays all its non-recurring and unusual
fees and expenses, if any, as determined by the Sponsor. Non-recurring and unusual fees and expenses are fees and expenses that are unexpected
or unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities, litigation costs or indemnification or other material expenses which are not
currently anticipated obligations of the Funds. 

The Administrator, Transfer Agent and Custodian 

U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, doing business
as U.S. Bank Global Fund Services Fund Services ), an indirect subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, serves as the Fund s fund
accountant, administrator and transfer agent pursuant to certain fund accounting servicing, fund administration servicing and transfer
agent servicing agreements. U.S. Bank National Association, a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp and parent company of Fund Services, intends
to serve as the Fund s custodian pursuant to a custody agreement. 

The Marketing Agent 

Foreside Fund Services, LLC (the Marketing
Agent serves as the Marketing Agent of the Funds. Its principal duties are: (i) to work with the Transfer Agent to review and
approve orders placed by Authorized Participants and transmitted to the Transfer Agent; (ii) maintain copies of confirmations of Creation
Unit creation and redemption order acceptances; (iii) maintain telephonic, facsimile and/or access to direct computer communications links
with the Transfer Agent; and (iv) review and approve, prior to use, all Trust marketing materials for compliance with applicable SEC and
FINRA advertising rules. 

The Marketing Agent retains all marketing materials
separately for the Funds, at their offices located at Three Canal Plaza, Suite 100 Portland, Maine 04101. 

As compensation for the services it provides, the Marketing
Agent receives a fee from the Funds.

Shares of a Fund. Creation Units may be created
or redeemed only by Authorized Participants. 

Except when aggregated in Creation Units, the Shares
are not redeemable securities. Retail investors, therefore, generally will not be able to purchase or redeem Shares directly from or with
a Fund. Rather, most retail investors will purchase or sell Shares in the secondary market with the assistance of a broker. Thus, some
of the information contained in these Notes to Financial Statements such as references to the Transaction Fees imposed on purchases
and redemptions is not relevant to retail investors. 

Transaction Fees on Creation and Redemption Transactions 

The manner by which Creation Units are purchased
or redeemed is governed by the terms of the Authorized Participant Agreement and Authorized Participant Procedures Handbook. By placing
a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to: (1) deposit cash with the Custodian; and (2) if permitted by the Sponsor in its
sole discretion, enter into or arrange for an exchange of futures contract for related position or block trade with the relevant fund
whereby the Authorized Participant would also transfer to such Fund a number and type of exchange-traded futures contracts at or near
the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date. 

Authorized Participants may pay a fee up to 
of the value of each order they place with each order to create or redeem a Creation Unit in order to compensate the Administrator, the
Custodian and the Transfer Agent of each Fund and its Shares, for services in processing the creation and redemption of Creation Units
and to offset the costs of increasing or decreasing derivative positions, unless the transaction fee is waived or otherwise adjusted by
the Sponsor. 

The Sponsor provides such Authorized Participant
with prompt notice in advance of any such waiver or adjustment of the transaction fee. Authorized Participants may sell the Shares included
in the Creation Units they purchase from the Funds to other investors in the secondary market.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. 

This information should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements included with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion and
analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward- looking
statements can be identified by terminology such as will, may, should, expect, 
 plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential, 
 intend, project, seek or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. None of
the Trust, the Sponsor, the Trustee, or the Administrator assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any forward-looking
statements. Except as expressly required by federal securities laws, none of the Trust, the Sponsor, the Trustee, or the Administrator
is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in expectations
or predictions. 

Because forward-looking statements relate to
the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risk and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which
are outside of the Funds control. The Funds forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions
and important factors, risks and uncertainties in the markets for financial instruments that the Funds trade, in the markets for related
physical commodities, in the legal and regulatory regimes applicable to the Sponsor, the Funds, and the Funds service providers,
and in the broader economy may cause the Funds actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. 

Introduction 

VS Trust (the Trust is a Delaware
statutory trust formed on October 24, 2019 and is currently organized into two separate series (each, a Fund and collectively,
the Funds ). As of September 30, 2022, the following two series of the Trust have commenced investment operations: -1x Short
VIX Futures ETF and 2x Long VIX Futures ETF. Each of the Funds listed above issues common units of beneficial interest Shares ),
which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of only that Fund. The Shares of each Fund are listed
on the Cboe BZX Exchange Cboe BZX ). 

The Trust had no operations prior to March 28,
2022, other than matters relating to its organization, the registration of each series under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

The Sponsor also serves as the Trust s commodity
pool operator. Wilmington Trust Company serves as the Trustee of the Trust (the Trustee ). The Funds are commodity pools,
as defined under the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ), and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(the CFTC and are operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. The Trust is not an investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

SVIX seeks daily investment results, before fees
and expenses, that correspond to the performance of the Short VIX Futures Index (the Short Index for a single day, not
for any other period. UVIX seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to twice the performance of the Long
VIX Futures Index (the Long Index ). A single day is measured from the time a Fund calculates its net asset
value NAV to the time of the Fund s next NAV calculation. The NAV calculation time for a Fund typically is 4:00
p.m. (Eastern Time). 

- 2 - 

The Funds seek to achieve their investment objective
through the appropriate amount of exposure to the VIX futures contracts included in their respective index. The Funds also have the ability
to engage in options transactions, swaps, forward contracts and other instruments in order to achieve their investment objective, in the
manner and to the extent described herein. 

SVIX is not benchmarked to the inverse of, and
UVIX is not benchmarked to twice, the widely referenced VIX. The Short Index and the inverse of the VIX are separate measurements and
can be expected to perform very differently. The Long Index and twice the VIX also are separate measurements and can be expected to perform
very differently. As such, SVIX can be expected to perform very differently from the inverse (-1x) of the performance of the VIX over any period, and UVIX can be expected to perform very differently
from twice (2x) of the performance of the VIX over any period. 

The Funds continuously offer and redeem Shares
in blocks of at least 10,000 Shares (each such block, a Creation Unit ). Only Authorized Participants (as defined herein)
may purchase and redeem Shares from a Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is an entity that has entered into
an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trust and Volatility Shares LLC (the Sponsor ). Shares are offered on a continuous
basis to Authorized Participants in Creation Units at NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, Shares
from any Creation Unit they create at a per-Share market price. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and the related Authorized
Participant Procedures Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem a Creation
Unit. Authorized Participants will not receive from a Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any fee or other compensation in
connection with their sale of Shares to the public. An Authorized Participant may receive commissions or fees from investors who purchase
Shares through their commission or fee-based brokerage accounts. 

The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and
related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem
a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from any Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any underwriting fees
or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public. The Sponsor maintains a website at www.volatilityshares.com, through
which monthly account statements and the Trust s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those
reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ),
can be accessed free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC s
EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In order to collateralize derivatives positions
in indices, commodities or currencies, a portion of the NAV of each Fund is held in cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities,
or other high credit quality short term fixed-income or similar securities (such as shares of money market funds, bank deposits, bank
money market accounts, certain variable rate-demand notes and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities. A portion
of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection with swap agreements, futures, and/or forward contracts. The percentage
that U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term fixed-income securities bear to the shareholders equity of each Fund varies from
period to period as the market values of the underlying swaps, futures contracts and forward contracts change.

Futures Contracts 

A futures contract is a standardized contract traded
on, or subject to the rules of, an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a particular underlying
asset at a specified time and place or alternatively may call for cash settlement. Futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of underlying
assets, including bonds, interest rates, agricultural products, stock indexes, currencies, energy, metals, economic indicators and statistical
measures. The notional size and calendar term futures contracts on a particular underlying asset are identical and are not subject to
any negotiation, other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller. A Fund generally deposits
cash and/or securities with an FCM for its open positions in futures contracts, which may, in turn, transfer such deposits to the clearinghouse
to protect the clearing house against non-payment by the Fund. The clearing house becomes substituted for each counterparty to a futures
contract, and, in effect, guarantees performance. In addition, the FCM may require a Fund to deposit collateral in excess of the clearing
house s margin requirements for the FCM s own protection. 

Certain futures contracts, including stock index
contracts, VIX futures contracts and certain commodity futures contracts settle in cash. The cash settlement amount reflects the difference
between the contract purchase/sale price and the contract settlement price. The cash settlement mechanism avoids the potential for either
side to have to deliver the underlying asset. For other futures contracts, the contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally
be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying asset or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical
futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery. The difference between the price at which the
futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase, after allowance for brokerage commissions
and exchange fees, constitutes the profit or loss to the trader. 

Futures contracts involve, to varying degrees,
elements of market risk and exposure to loss in excess of the amounts of variation margin, which are the amounts of cash that a Fund agrees
to pay to or receive from FCMs equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of a futures contract. Additional risks associated with the
use of futures contracts are imperfect correlation between movements in the price of the futures contracts and the level of the underlying
benchmark and the possibility of an illiquid market for a futures contract. With futures contracts, there is minimal but some counterparty
risk to a Fund since futures contracts are exchange traded and the exchange s clearing house, as counterparty to all exchange-traded
futures contracts, effectively guarantees futures contracts against default. Many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount
of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular
contract, no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified times during the trading
day. Futures contracts prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing
prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting a Fund to substantial losses. If trading is not possible or if a Fund
determines not to close a futures position in anticipation of adverse price movements, the Fund may be required to make daily cash payments
of variation margin. 

- 5 - 

Futures Account Agreements 

Each Fund has entered into a written agreement
(each, a Futures Account Agreement with one or more FCMs governing the terms of futures transactions of a Fund cleared
by such FCM. Each FCM has its own agreement and other documentation used for establishing customer relationships. As such, the terms of
the Futures Account Agreement and other documentation that a Fund has with a particular FCM may differ in material respects from that
with another FCM. 

Most Futures Account Agreements do not require
the FCM to enter into new transactions or maintain existing transactions with a Fund. In general, each FCM is permitted to terminate its
agreement with a Fund at any time in its sole discretion. In addition, an FCM generally will have the discretion to set margin requirements
and/or position limits that would be in addition to any margin requirements and/or position limits required by applicable law, set by
the exchange, or set by the clearing house that clears the futures contracts in which a Fund transacts. As a result, a Fund s ability
to engage in futures transactions or maintain open positions in such contracts will be dependent on the willingness of its FCMs to continue
to accept or maintain such transactions on terms that are economically appropriate for a Fund s investment strategy. 

When a Fund has an open futures contract position,
it is subject to at least daily variation margin calls by an FCM that could be substantial in the event of adverse price movements. Because
futures contracts may require only a small initial investment in the form of a deposit or margin, they may involve a high degree of leverage.
A Fund with open positions is subject to maintenance or variance margin on its open positions. If a Fund has insufficient cash to meet
daily variation margin requirements, it may need to sell Financial Instruments at a time when such sales are disadvantageous. Futures
markets are highly volatile and the use of or exposure to futures contracts may increase volatility of a Fund s NAV. 

Margin posted by a Fund to an FCM typically will
be held by relevant exchange s clearing house (in the case of clearing house-required margin) or the FCM (in the case of house 
margin requirements of the FCM). In the event that market movements favorable to a Fund result in the Fund having posted more margin than
is required, the Fund typically would have a right to return of margin from the FCM. However, the timing of such return may be uncertain.
As a result, it is possible that a Fund may face liquidity constraints including potential delays in its ability to pay redemption proceeds,
where margin is not immediately returned by an FCM. 

In the event that a Fund fails to comply with its
obligations under a Futures Account Agreement (including, for example, failing to deliver the margin required by an FCM on a timely basis),
the Futures Account Agreement typically will provide the FCM with broad discretion to take remedial action against the Fund. Among other
things, the FCM typically will have the right, upon the occurrence of such a failure by a Fund, to terminate any or all futures contracts
in the Fund s account with that FCM, to sell the collateral posted as margin by the Fund, to close out any open positions of the
Fund in whole or in part, and to cancel any or all pending transactions with the Fund. Futures Account Agreements typically provide that
the Fund will remain liable for paying to the relevant FCM, on demand, the amount of any deficiency in a Fund s account with that
FCM. 

- 6 - 

The Futures Account Agreement between the Fund
and an FCM generally requires the Fund to indemnify and hold harmless the FCM, its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates
(collectively, indemnified persons from and against all claims, damages, losses and costs (including reasonable attorneys 
fees) incurred by the indemnified persons, in connection with: (1) any failure by the Fund to perform its obligations under the Futures
Account Agreement and the FCM s exercise of its rights and remedies thereunder; (2) any failure by the Fund to comply with applicable
law; (3) any action reasonably taken by the indemnified persons pursuant to the Futures Account Agreement to comply with applicable law;
and (4) any actions taken by the FCM in reliance on instructions, notices and other communications that the FCM and its relevant personnel,
as applicable, reasonably believes to originate from a person authorized to act on behalf of the Fund. 

To the extent that the Fund
trades in futures contracts on U.S. exchanges, the assets deposited by the Fund with the FCMs (or another eligible financial institution,
as applicable) as margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such segregated funds
may be invested only in a limited range of instruments principally U.S. government obligations to margin futures and forward contract
positions. 

Options 

An option is a contract that gives the purchaser
of the option, in return for the premium paid, the right to buy an underlying reference instrument, such as a specified security index,
or other instrument, from the writer of the option (in the case of a call option), or to sell a specified reference instrument to the
writer of the option (in the case of a put option) at a designated price during the term of the option. The premium paid by the buyer
of an option will reflect, among other things, the relationship of the exercise price to the market price and the volatility of the underlying
reference instrument, the remaining term of the option, supply, demand or interest rates. An American style put or call option may be
exercised at any time during the option period while a European style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during
a fixed period prior thereto. Put and call options are traded on national securities exchanges and in the OTC market. Options traded on
national securities exchanges are within the jurisdiction of the SEC or other appropriate national securities regulator, as are securities
traded on such exchanges. As a result, many of the protections provided to traders on organized exchanges will be available with respect
to such transactions. In particular, all option positions entered into on a national securities exchange in the United States are cleared
and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation, thereby reducing the risk of counterparty default. Furthermore, a liquid secondary
market in options traded on a national securities exchange may be more readily available than in the OTC market, potentially permitting
a Fund to liquidate open positions at a profit prior to exercise or expiration, or to limit losses in the event of adverse market movements.
There is no assurance, however, that higher than anticipated trading activity or other unforeseen events might not temporarily render
the capabilities of the Options Clearing Corporation inadequate, and thereby result in the exchange instituting special procedures which
may interfere with the timely execution of a Fund s orders to close out open options positions. 

- 7 - 

Swap Agreements 

Swaps are contracts that have traditionally been
entered into primarily by institutional investors in OTC markets for a specified period ranging from a day to many years. Certain types
of swaps may be cleared, and certain types are, in fact, required to be cleared. The types of swaps that may be cleared are generally
limited to only swaps where the most liquidity exists and a clearing organization is willing to clear the trade on standardized terms.
Swaps with customized terms or those for which significant market liquidity does not exist are generally not able to be cleared. 

In a standard swap transaction, the parties agree
to exchange the returns on, among other things, a particular predetermined security, commodity, interest rate, or index for a fixed or
floating rate of return (the interest rate leg, which will also include the cost of borrowing for short swaps) in respect
of a predetermined notional amount. The notional amount of the swap reflects the extent of a Fund s total investment exposure under
the swap. 

In the case of futures contracts-based indexes,
such as those used by a Fund, the reference interest rate typically is zero, although a financing spread or fee is generally still applied.
Transaction or commission costs are reflected in the benchmark level at which the transaction is entered into. The gross returns to be
exchanged are calculated with respect to the notional amount and the benchmark returns to which the swap is linked. Swaps are usually
closed out on a net basis, i.e. , the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date specified in the
agreement, with the parties receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. Thus, while the notional
amount reflects a Fund s total investment exposure under the swap i.e. , the entire face amount or principal of a swap),
the net amount is the Fund s current obligations (or rights) under the swap. That is the amount to be paid or received under the
agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement on any given termination date. 

Swaps may also expose a Fund to liquidity risk.
Although a Fund may have the ability to terminate a swap at any time, doing so may subject the Fund to certain early termination charges.
In addition, there may not be a liquid market within which to dispose of an outstanding swap even if a permitted disposal might avoid
an early termination charge. Uncleared swaps generally are not assignable except by agreement between the parties to the swap, and generally
no party or purchaser has any obligation to permit such assignments. 

Swaps involve, to varying degrees, elements of
market risk and exposure to loss in excess of the amount which would be reflected on a Fund s Statement of Financial Condition.
In addition to market risk and other risks, the use of swaps also comes with counterparty credit risk i.e. , the inability
of a counterparty to a swap to perform its obligations. A Fund that invests in swaps bears the risk of loss of the net amount, if any,
expected to be received under a swap agreement in the event of the default or bankruptcy of a swap counterparty. A Fund enters or intends
to enter into swaps only with major, global financial institutions. However, there are no limitations on the percentage of its assets
a Fund may invest in swaps with a particular counterparty. 

A Fund that invests in swaps may use various techniques
to minimize counterparty credit risk. A Fund that invests in swaps generally enters into arrangements with its counterparties whereby
both sides exchange collateral on a mark-to-market basis. In addition, the Fund may post initial margin or independent
amount to counterparties in swaps. Such collateral serves as protection for the counterparty in the event of a failure by the Fund
and is in addition to any mark-to-market collateral that i.e. , the Fund may post initial margin to the counterparty even where
the counterparty would owe money to the Fund if the swap were to be terminated). The amount of initial margin posted by the Fund may vary
depending on the risk profile of the swap. The collateral, whether for mark-to-market or for initial margin, generally consists of cash
and/or securities. 

Collateral posted by a Fund to a counterparty
in connection with uncleared derivatives transactions is generally held for the benefit of the counterparty in a segregated
tri-party account at a third-party custodian to protect the counterparty against non-payment by the Fund. In the event of a default
by a Fund where the counterparty is owed money in the uncleared swap transaction, such counterparty will seek withdrawal of this
collateral from the segregated account. 

Collateral posted by the counterparty
to a Fund is typically held for the benefit of the Fund in a segregated tri-party account at a third-party custodian. In the event of
a default by the counterparty where the Fund is owed money in the uncleared swap transaction, the Fund will seek withdrawal of this collateral
from the segregated account. The Fund may incur certain costs exercising its right with respect to the collateral. 

Notwithstanding the use of collateral arrangements,
to the extent any collateral provided to a Fund is insufficient or there are delays in accessing the collateral, a Fund will be exposed
to counterparty risk as described above, including possible delays in recovering amounts as a result of bankruptcy proceedings.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

As of September 30, 2024, the Funds have not used,
nor do they expect to use in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements and have no loan
guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business,
which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in
the best interests of the Funds. While each Fund s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general
business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on a Fund s financial position. 

Management fee payments made to the Sponsor are
calculated as a fixed percentage of each Fund s NAV. As such, the Sponsor cannot anticipate the payment amounts that will be required
under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs are not known until a future date. The agreement with the Sponsor may be terminated
by either party upon 30 days written notice to the other party. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Preparation of the financial statements and related
disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate
accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Trust s and the Funds application of these policies involves
judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. 

Each Fund has significant exposure to Financial
Instruments. The Funds hold a significant portion of their assets in futures, all of which are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair
value in the financial statements, with changes in fair value reported in the Statements of Operations. 

The use of fair value to measure Financial Instruments,
with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period, is fundamental to the Trust s and the Funds 
financial statements. The fair value of a Financial Instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). 

For financial reporting purposes, the Funds value
investments based upon the closing price in their primary markets. Accordingly, the investment valuations in these financial statements
may differ from those used in the calculation of certain Funds final creation/redemption NAV for the period ended September 30,
2024. 

Short-term investments are valued at amortized
cost which approximates fair value for daily NAV purposes. For financial reporting purposes, short- term investments are valued at their
market price using information provided by a third-party pricing service or market quotations.

Derivatives (e.g., futures contracts, options,
swap agreements) are generally valued using independent sources and/or agreements with counterparties or other procedures as determined
by the Sponsor. Futures contracts, are generally valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that future trades.
Futures contracts valuations are typically categorized as Level I in the fair value hierarchy. Swap agreement valuations are typically
categorized as Level II in the fair value hierarchy. The Sponsor may in its sole discretion choose to determine a fair value price as
the basis for determining the market value of such position. Such fair value prices would be generally determined based on available inputs
about the current value of the underlying financial instrument or commodity and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair
and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. The Sponsor may fair value an asset of a Fund
pursuant to the policies the Sponsor has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards. Depending on the source and relevant
significance of valuation inputs, these instruments may be classified as Level II or Level III in the fair value hierarchy. 

Fair value pricing may require subjective determinations
about the value of an investment. While each Fund s policy is intended to result in a calculation of the Fund s NAV that fairly
reflects investment values as of the time of pricing, the Funds cannot ensure that fair values determined by the Sponsor or persons acting
at their direction would accurately reflect the price that the Fund could obtain for an investment if it were to dispose of that investment
as of the time of pricing (for instance, in a forced or distressed sale). 

The prices used by a Fund may differ from the value
that would be realized if the investments were sold and the differences could be material to the financial statements. 

The Funds disclose the fair value of their investments
in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Discounts on short-term securities purchased
are amortized and reflected as Interest Income in the Statements of Operations. 

Realized gains (losses) and changes in unrealized
gain (loss) on open investments are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statements of Operations in the
period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively. 

Each Fund pays its respective brokerage commissions,
including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give up fees, pit futures account fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged
in connection with trading activities for each Fund s investment in U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulated investments.
Brokerage commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis. The Sponsor is currently paying brokerage commissions
in VIX futures contracts exceed variable create/redeem fees collected by more than 0.02 of the Fund s average net assets annually.

The short futures notional values are calculated
by multiplying the number of contracts held times the valuation price times the contract multiplier. The short notional values will increase
(decrease) proportionally with decreases (increases) in the price of the futures contract. Additional gains (losses) associated with these
contracts will be equal to any such subsequent decreases (increases) in short notional values, before accounting for spreads or transaction
or financing costs. The Fund will generally attempt to adjust its position in Financial Instruments each day to have - 1.00 of short exposure
to the Index for every 1.00 of net assets. Future period returns, before fees and expenses, cannot be estimated simply by estimating
the return of the Index and multiplying by negative one-half. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional information regarding performance for periods longer than a single day.

The futures notional values are calculated by multiplying
the number of contracts held times the valuation price times the contract multiplier. The swap notional values are calculated by multiplying
the number of units times the closing level of the Index. These notional values will increase (decrease) proportionally with increases
(decreases) in the price of the futures contract or the level of the Index, as applicable. Additional gains (losses) associated with these
contracts will be equal to any such subsequent increases (decreases) in notional values, before accounting for spreads or transaction
or financing costs. 

The Fund will generally attempt to adjust its positions
in Financial Instruments each day to have 2.00 of exposure to the Index for every 1.00 of net assets. Future period returns, before
fees and expenses, cannot be estimated simply by estimating the return of the Index and multiplying by one and one-half. See Item
1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the
participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Trust, Trust management has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Trust s and the Funds disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded that the disclosure
controls and procedures of the Trust and the Funds (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the 1934 Act )) were effective, as of September 30, 2022, including providing reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Trust files or submits under the 1934 Act on behalf of the Trust
and the Funds is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the Trust as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Trust s or the
Funds internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s or the Funds internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Investments in futures contracts are subject to
current position limits and accountability levels established by the exchanges. Accordingly, the Sponsor and the Funds may be required
to reduce the size of outstanding positions or be restricted from entering into new positions that would otherwise be taken for a Fund
or not trade in certain markets on behalf of the Fund in order to comply with those limits or any future limits. These restrictions, if
implemented, could limit the ability of each Fund to invest in additional futures contracts, add to existing positions in the desired
amount, or create additional Creation Units and could otherwise have a significant negative impact on Fund operations and performance,
decreasing a Fund s correlation to the performance of its benchmark, and otherwise preventing a Fund from achieving its investment
objective.
