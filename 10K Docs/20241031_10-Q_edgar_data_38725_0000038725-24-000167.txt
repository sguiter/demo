 million, including contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million, after purchase price adjustments based on the level of working capital acquired. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment of million to increase the acquisition-date fair value of the contingent consideration transferred. The measurement period adjustment resulted in an increase to acquired identifiable intangible assets of million and a reduction to acquired goodwill of million . The measurement period adjustments did not have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the above acquisitions is preliminary as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company acquired all of the assets of Phil-Good Products, Inc. ("Phil-Good"). Phil-Good is an injection molded plastics component manufacturer. In another separate transaction in the first quarter of 2023, the Company acquired percent of the ownership interests of Hydropompe S.r.l. ("Hydropompe"). Hydropompe is a pump manufacturer with a focus in dewatering and sewage products. The combined, all-cash purchase price for both

In the absence of quoted prices in active markets, considerable judgment is required in developing estimates of fair value. Estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market transaction. In determining the fair value of its debt, the Company uses estimates based on rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Accordingly, the fair value of debt is classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.

 days' written notice by either party. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the swap had a notional value based on shares. For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in the fair value of the swap resulted in gains of million, and million, respectively. For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, changes in the fair value of the swap resulted in a loss of million and a gain of million, respectively. Gains and losses resulting from the swap were largely offset by gains and losses on the fa ir value of the deferred compensation stock liability. All gains or losses and expenses related to the swap are recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income within the Selling, general, and administrative expenses line. 
 
 The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business including making sales and purchases of raw materials and finished goods in foreign denominated currencies with third party customers and suppliers as well as to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. To reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility, the Company enters into various forward currency contracts to offset these fluctuations. The Company uses forward currency contracts only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and to minimize earnings volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not elected to use hedge accounting. Decisions on whether to use such derivative instruments are primarily based on the amount of exposure to the currency involved and an assessment of the near-term market value for each currency. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a notional amount of million in forward currency contracts outstanding and the related fair value of those contracts was not material. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had foreign currency contracts outstanding. For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, changes in the fair value of the forward currency contracts resulted in losses of million and million, respectively. For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, changes in the fair value of the forward currency contracts resulted in gains of million and million, respectively. These gains and losses are recorded in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of income within the "Foreign exchange income (expense), net" line.

 percent as compared to percent for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of percent primarily due to state taxes and foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate partially offset by the recognition of the U.S. foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) provisions and certain discrete events including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. For the third quarter of 2024, the effective tax rate was percent compared to percent for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The increase in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the comparable periods in the prior year was a result of less favorable discrete events in 2024, primarily related to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, in addition to an increase in the rate on foreign earnings with the implementation of the European Union s Pillar Two Directive.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Third Quarter 2024 vs. 2023 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 decreased 1 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from the prior-year periods. The sales decreases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were primarily due to lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by price realization and the incremental sales impact from recent acquisitions. The Company's consolidated gross profit was 189.7 million and 553.0 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, increases of 3.4 million and 16.0 million, respectively, from the prior-year periods. Diluted earnings per share was 1.17 and 3.14, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, decreases of 0.06 and 0.15, respectively, from the prior-year periods. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 531.4 million and 1.5 billion, respectively, and decreased 1 percent and 4 percent as compared to the prior-year periods. Sales were negatively impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, principally due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Argentine Peso and Turkish Lira. However, the Company increases prices in the local currency to offset the impact of currency devaluation in the Argentina and Turkey hyperinflationary economies. As a result, the net negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales was 1 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in the prior year.

 Net Sales-Water Systems 
 Water Systems net sales increased 2 percent in the third quarter but decreased 2 percent in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year periods. The sales growth in the third quarter was primarily due to higher volumes and price realization. The sales decline in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily due to lower volumes, which decreased due to weaker end market demand for large dewatering equipment. Sales decreased 2 percent in the third quarter and 1 percent in the first nine months of 2024 due to the negative impact from foreign exchange rates, as compared to prior-year periods. The incremental sales impact from a recent acquisition favorably impacted sales 2 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Water Systems net sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 1 percent in the third quarter but decreased 5 percent in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year periods. In the third quarter of 2024, sales of groundwater pumping equipment increased 13 percent, sales of water treatment products increased 9 percent, and the sales of all other surface pumping 
 23 

equipment increased 5 percent compared to 2023. Partially offsetting the increase, sales of large dewatering equipment decreased 31 percent compared to 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, sales of large dewatering equipment decreased 43 percent, sales of water treatment products increased 12 percent, sales of all other surface pumping equipment increased 5 percent and sales of groundwater pumping equipment increased 3 percent compared to 2023. 
 
 Water Systems net sales in markets outside the U.S. and Canada increased 4 percent in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year periods. Sales decreased 4 percent in the third quarter and 3 percent in the first nine months of 2024 due to the negative impact from foreign exchange rates, as compared to prior-year periods. In both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, sales increased in all three major regions: EMEA, Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
 
 Net Sales-Fueling Systems 
 Fueling Systems net sales decreased 10 percent in the third quarter and 11 percent in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year periods. These sales declines were primarily due to lower volumes. 
 
 Fueling Systems net sales in the U.S. and Canada decreased 4 percent in the third quarter and 6 percent in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year periods. Outside the U.S. and Canada, Fueling Systems net sales decreased 22 percent in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year periods. The decreases were across all product lines. 
 
 Net Sales - Distribution 
 Distribution net sales increased 1 percent in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year periods. The Distribution segment sales increased due to the incremental sales impact from a recent acquisition which favorably impacted net sales by 2 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, partially offset by the negative impact of commodity pricing declines and unfavorable weather.

 Operating Income-Water Systems 
 Water Systems operating income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 52.8 million and 162.3 million, respectively, increases of 0.1 million and 9.8 million, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods. The increases were primarily due to price realization, cost management and a favorable product and geographic sales mix shift. The third quarter operating income margin was 17.5 percent, a decrease of 30 basis points from 17.8 percent in the third quarter of 2023. The first nine months of 2024 operating income margin was 17.9 percent, an increase of 140 basis points from 16.5 percent in the first nine months of 2023. Operating income margin increased in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to cost management and a favorable product and geographic sales mix shift. 
 
 Operating Income-Fueling Systems 
 Fueling Systems operating income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 24.1 million and 68.9 million, respectively, decreases of 1.7 million and 4.4 million, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods. The decreases were primarily due to lower sales. The third quarter operating income margin was 34.6 percent, an increase of 140 basis points from 33.2 percent in the third quarter of 2023. The first nine months of 2024 operating income margin was 33.6 percent, an increase of 180 basis points from 31.8 percent in the first nine months of 2023. Operating income margin increased primarily due to price realization and cost management. 
 
 Operating Income-Distribution 
 Distribution operating income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 12.2 million and 23.8 million, respectively, an increase of 1.5 million and a decrease of 9.4 million, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods. The third quarter operating income margin was 6.4 percent, an increase of 70 basis points from 5.7 percent in the third quarter of 2023. The first nine months of 2024 operating income margin was 4.5 percent, a decrease of 180 basis points from 6.3 percent in the first nine months of 2023. Operating income and operating income margin increased in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to the incremental impact from a recent acquisition. Operating income and operating income margin decreased in the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to the negative impact on sales from wet weather across much of the United States, decreases in pricing of commodity-based products sold through the business and increased SG A costs. 
 
 Operating Income-Eliminations/Other 
 Operating income-Eliminations/Other is composed primarily of intersegment sales and profit eliminations and unallocated general and administrative expenses. The intersegment profit elimination impact in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior-year periods of 2023 was an unfavorable 0.7 million and 2.2 million, respectively. The intersegment elimination of operating income effectively defers the operating income on sales from Water Systems to Distribution in the consolidated financial results until such time as the transferred product is sold from the Distribution segment to its end third party customer. General and administrative expenses increased 3.8 million and 4.8 million, respectively, 
 25 

compared to the prior-year periods. The increase was primarily driven by to higher employee compensation costs, including incremental expenses associated with the Company s CEO transition. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 1.6 million and 5.0 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and 3.0 million and 10.3 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The decreases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by lower debt. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 Other (expense) income, net was an expense of 0.2 million and income of 0.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and was income of 0.3 million and 1.9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. 
 
 Foreign Exchange 
 Foreign currency-based transactions produced a gain of 0.1 million and an expense 5.2 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, and an expense of 2.5 million and 8.1 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The results in the first nine months of 2024 and the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 are primarily due to transaction losses associated with the Turkish Lira and Argentine Peso relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company reports the results of its subsidiaries in Argentina and Turkey using highly inflationary accounting, which requires that the functional currency of the entity be changed to the reporting currency of its parent. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 17.0 million and 43.8 million, respectively, and 14.7 million and 39.2 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 23.6 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively, and 20.2 percent and 20.1 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the comparable periods in the prior year was a result of less favorable discrete events in 2024, primarily related to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, in addition to an increase in the rate on foreign earnings with the implementation of the European Union s Pillar Two Directive in 2024. 
 
 Net Income 
 Net income in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 54.9 million and 147.3 million, respectively, and 58.2 million and 155.9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. Net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 54.6 million and 146.7 million, respectively, or 1.17 and 3.14 per diluted share. Net income attributable to Franklin Electric Co., Inc. in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was 57.8 million and 154.7 million, respectively, or 1.23 and 3.29 per diluted share.

The change in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to changes in working capital and lower earnings. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 2024 vs. 2023 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 29.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 36.8 million used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net cash used in financing activities was 100.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 140.3 million used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in financing cash flow was primarily due to lower net repayments under the Company's credit facility in 2024 compared to 2023, partially offset by lower proceeds from option exercises, increased share repurchase activity and higher dividends.
