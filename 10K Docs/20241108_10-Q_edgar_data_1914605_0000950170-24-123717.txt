 shares of common stock at a per share price of for gross offering proceeds of million. Additionally, the Company contributed shares and in cash to the Everett Co-operative Bank Charitable Foundation (the Foundation ). Pursuant to regulation, as part of the conversion, the Bank has established a Liquidation Account in an amount equal to the net worth of the Bank as of the date of the latest consolidated statement of financial condition contained in the final prospectus distributed in connection with the Company s stock offering. The Liquidation Account will be maintained by the Bank for the benefit of the eligible account holders who continue to maintain deposit accounts with the Bank. Each eligible account holder shall, with respect to each deposit account, hold a related inchoate interest in a portion of the Liquidation Account balance, in relation to each deposit account balance at the eligibility record date, or to such balance as it may be subsequently reduced, as hereinafter provided. The initial Liquidation Account balance shall not be increased, and shall be subject to downward adjustment to the extent of any downward adjustment of any subaccount balance of any eligible account holder in accordance with the regulations of the Division of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank (and only in such event), following all liquidation payments to creditors (including those to depositors to the extent of their deposit accounts) each eligible account holder shall be entitled to receive a liquidating distribution from the Liquidation Account, in the amount of the then-adjusted subaccount balances for his or her deposit accounts then held, before any liquidating distribution may be made to any holder of the Bank s capital stock. The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its outstanding capital stock if the effect thereof would cause its regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required to maintain the Liquidation Account and under FDIC rules and regulations.

In November 2024, FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , which requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, but expects additional disclosures upon adoption.

The Company measures expected credit losses on held to maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type. Management classifies the held-to maturity portfolio into the following major security types: U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises, U.S. Treasury, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, and Corporate Bonds. Substantially all held to maturity securities held by the Company are guaranteed by the U.S. federal government or other government sponsored agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. As a result, management has determined these securities to have a zero loss expectation and therefore the Company did not record a provision for estimated credit losses on any held to maturity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company's investments in corporate bonds are deemed investment grade and (a) the Company does not intend to sell these securities before recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities before recovery. The Company does not expect to suffer a credit loss as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Excluded from the table above is accrued interest on held to maturity securities of a nd at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included within accrued interest receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Addi tionally, the Company did t record any write-offs of accrued interest income on held to maturity securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . securities held by the Company were delinquent on contractual payments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nor were any securities placed on non-accrual status for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Company's available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, management will first evaluate whether there is intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the Company will record a write-down of the security's amortized cost basis to fair value through income. For those available-for-sale securities which do not meet the intent or requirement to sell criteria, management will evaluate whether the decline in fair value is a result of credit related matters or other factors. In performing this assessment, Management considers the creditworthiness of the issuer including whether the security is guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Government or other government agency, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes in credit rating during the period, among other factors. If this assessment indicates the existence of credit losses, the security will be written down to fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flow analysis. To the extent the estimated cash flows do not support the amortized cost, the deficiency is considered to be due to credit loss and is recognized in earnings. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectibility of a security is confirmed, or when either of the aforementioned criteria surrounding intent or requirement to sell have been met. The Company did t record a provision for estimated credit losses on any available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Excluded from the table above is accrued interest on available-for-sale securities of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, which is included within accrued interest receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company did t record any write-offs of accrued interest income on available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . securities held by the Company were delinquent on contractual payments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , r were any securities placed on non-accrual status for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. When securities are sold, the adjusted cost of the specific security sold is used to compute the gain or loss on the sale. There were sales of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Management evaluates securities for expected credit losses at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Held to Maturity and Available-for-Sale Securities The actual maturities of certain available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Credit Quality Information During the second quarter of 2024, the Company expanded its internal loan risk rating system from a grade system to a grade system. The new loan rating system for multi-family and commercial real estate, construction, commercial loans and certain residential and home equity lines of credit is as follows: Loans rated 1 6: Loans in these categories are considered pass rated loans with low to average risk. Loans rated 7: Loans in this category are considered special mention. These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management. 

 15 

or more, and all commercial real estate loans (including multi-family and construction loans as well as residential and home equity line of credit loans to commercial borrowers) with aggregate potential outstanding balances of million or more. For loans that are not formally rated, the Company initially assesses credit quality based upon the borrower s ability to pay and subsequently monitors these loans based on the borrower s payment activity.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan As part of the Initial Public Offering ("IPO") completed on July 27, 2022, the Bank established a tax-qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") to provide eligible employees the opportunity to own Company shares. The ESOP borrowed million 

 21 

common shares during the IPO. The loan is payable in annual installments over at an interest rate of . As the loan is repaid to the Company, shares are released and allocated proportionally to eligible participants on the basis of each participant s proportional share of compensation relative to the compensation of all participants. The unallocated ESOP shares are pledged as collateral on the loan. The Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance with FASB ASC 718-40, Compensation Stock Compensation. Under this guidance, unreleased shares are deducted from shareholders equity as unallocated common shares held by the ESOP in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of the ESOP shares during the periods in which they are committed to be released. To the extent that the fair value of the Company s ESOP shares differs from the cost of such shares, the difference will be credited or debited to shareholders' equity. As the loan is internally leveraged, the loan receivable from the ESOP to the Company is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP shown as a liability in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense recognized in connection with the ESOP was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively.

Under certain circumstances, the Company makes adjustments to its assets and liabilities although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Bank had assets or liabilities for which a nonrecurring change in fair value had been recorded. ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above. ASU 2016-01 requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. The exit price notion is a market-based measurement of fair value that is represented by the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) on the measurement date. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, fair values of loans are estimated on an exit price basis incorporating discounts for credit, liquidity and marketability factors.

The Bank accrues for credit losses related to off-balance sheet financial instruments. Potential losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments are estimated using the same risk factors used to determine the allowance for credit losses, adjusted for the likelihood that funding will occur. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , provision recorded for off-balance sheet commitments was and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , a benefit was recorded for off-balance sheet commitments for and , respectively. The provision and benefit for off-balance sheet commitments are recorded with provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments, the effective portion of the gains or losses is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The Company expects approximately to be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense from OCI related to the Company s cash flow hedges in the twelve months following September 30, 2024. This reclassification is due to anticipated payments that will be received on the swaps based upon the forward curve at September 30, 2024. The maximum length of time over which the Company is currently hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments is years.)

By using derivatives, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as required. Should a counterparty fail to perform under the terms of a derivative contract, the Company s credit exposure on interest rate swaps is limited to the net positive fair value and accrued interest of all swaps with each counterparty not secured by variation margin plus any initial margin collateral posted. The Company seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. As such, management believes the risk of incurring credit losses on derivative contracts with those counterparties is remote. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has pledged cash collateral to a derivative counterparty totaling . The Company may need to post additional collateral or may receive additional collateral in the future in proportion to potential changes in the overall unrealized gain or loss position. The Company had derivatives as of December 31, 2023. There was OCI or interest expense related to cash flow hedges recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

Item 2. Ma nagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 General 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations at and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and the notes thereto, appearing on Part I, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, continue, intend, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

statements regarding the quality of our loan portfolio; and 

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. 
 The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 
 changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; 

our ability to access cost-effective funding; 

fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; 

demand for loans and deposits in our market area; 

our ability to implement and change our business strategies; 

competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, our mortgage banking revenues, the fair value of financial instruments, or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we have made and make; 

adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets; 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums; 

changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; 

technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; 

the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; 

a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks; 

our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk; 

our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; 

31 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

the risk of adverse changes in business conditions due to geo-political tensions; 

our ability to attract and retain key employees; and 

changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 

Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in ECB Bancorp, Inc. s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2024. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology for loans measured at amortized cost. The allowance for credit losses is established based upon the Company's current estimate of expected lifetime credit losses. Arriving at an appropriate amount of allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment. 
 The Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a quantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk inherent in the quantitative model output. Management's judgment is required for the selection and application of these factors which are derived from historical loss experience as well as assumptions surrounding expected future losses and economic forecasts. 
 Loans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual assessment and are removed from the collectively assessed pools to avoid double counting. For the loans that are individually assessed, the Company uses either a discounted cash flow DCF approach or a fair value of collateral approach. The latter approach is used for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure is probable. Changes in these judgments and assumptions could be due to a number of circumstances which may have a direct impact on the provision for credit losses and may result in changes to the amount of allowance. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off. Credit losses are charged against the allowance when management's assessments confirm that the Company will not collect the full amortized cost basis of a loan. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are 
 32 

reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments may require us to make projections of future taxable income and/or to carryback to taxable income in prior years. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 
 
 Securities Valuation 
 
 We classify our investments in debt securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Securities classified as held-to maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. We obtain our fair values from one or more third-party services. This service s fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis, or through obtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 For any debt security with a fair value less than its amortized cost basis, we will determine whether we have the intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either condition is met, the Company will recognize a full impairment charge to earnings. For all other debt securities that don't meet either condition and that have expected credit losses, the credit loss will be recognized in earnings. Any non-credit related loss impairment related to all other factors will be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Management also assesses the nature of the unrealized losses taking into consideration factors such as changes in risk-free interest rates, general credit spread widening, market supply and demand, creditworthiness of the issuer, and quality of the underlying collateral. 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 Total Assets. Total assets increased 77.6 million, or 6.1 , to 1.36 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.28 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of increases in loans. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 594,000, or 0.5 , to 119.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 119.0 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Investment Securities Available for Sale. Investment securities available for sale decreased 840,000, or 16.8 , to 4.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from 5.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to maturities and was partially offset by purchases. No securities were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investment Securities Held to Maturity. Investment securities held to maturity increased 254,000, or 0.3 , to 77.2 million as of September 30, 2024 from 77.0 million as of December 31, 2023 due to purchases of investment securities partially offset by principal paydowns and maturities. 
 Loans. Gross loans increased 75.9 million, or 7.2 , to 1.12 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.05 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Multi-family real estate loans increased 39.6 million, or 13.8 , to 327.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 287.4 million at December 31, 2023. 

Commercial real estate loans increased 26.3 million, or 13.4 , to 222.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 196.4 million at December 31, 2023.

Federal Home Loan Bank stock. The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) is a cooperative bank that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for our membership in the FHLB is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding and as a tool to manage interest rate risk. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. We purchase and/or are subject to redemption of FHLB stock proportional to the volume of funding received and view the holdings as a necessary long-term investment for the purpose of balance sheet liquidity and not for investment return. We held an investment in FHLB stock of 9.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Bank-owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to help offset the costs of our employee benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides noninterest income that is nontaxable. Bank-owned life insurance increased 353,000, or 2.4 , to 14.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 14.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of 353,000 in the cash surrender value of our bank-owned life insurance portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Deposits. Deposits increased 76.1 million, or 8.8 , to 944.3 million at September 30, 2024 from 868.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Certificates of deposit increased 83.0 million, or 16.7 , to 581.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 498.5 million at December 31, 2023. 

Money market deposit accounts increased 32.1 million, or 24.4 , to 163.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 131.4 million at December 31, 2023. 

Savings accounts decreased 31.5 million, or 22.8 , to 106.4 million at September 30, 2024 from 137.8 million at December 31, 2023. 

Demand deposit accounts decreased 4.3 million, or 5.5 , to 74.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 78.3 million at December 31, 2023. 

Interest-bearing checking accounts decreased 3.2 million, or 14.5 , to 18.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 22.2 million at December 31, 2023 

Core deposits (defined as all deposits other than certificates of deposit) decreased 6.9 million, or 1.9 , to 362.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 369.7 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank remained unchanged at 234.0 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 Shareholders' Equity. Total shareholders' equity increased 1.1 million, or 0.7 , to 166.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 164.9 million at December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily the result of net income of 2.5 million. Partially offsetting this increase in shareholders' equity was a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") of 910,000 and a decrease in additional paid-in capital of 761,000. The decrease in AOCI was driven by a decrease in the fair value of cash flow hedges entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in additional paid in capital was driven by 1.8 million in shares repurchased under our share repurchase plan, partially offset by an increase in additional paid in capital of 1.1 million related to stock based compensation and ESOP shares committed to be released. The book value per share increased 0.39 to 18.14 at September 30, 2024 from 17.75 at December 31, 2023. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net Income. We recorded net income of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was driven by an increase in net interest and dividend income, which was more than offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and an increase in noninterest expense. 
 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 3.0 million, or 21.1 , to 17.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a 2.5 million increase in interest and fees on loans, an 80,000 increase in interest and dividends on investment securities and a 373,000 increase in interest on short term investments. The increase in interest and fees on loans was driven by an increase of 119.6 million in the average balance of the loan portfolio to 1.12 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.00 billion for the 
 34 

three months ended September 30, 2023, as well as an increase in the average yield of 39 basis points to 5.27 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.88 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The yield for the three months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from new loans with higher rates as well as adjustable rate loans repricing higher. The increase in interest and dividend income on investment securities was driven by an increase in the yield on securities of 42 basis points to 3.00 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.58 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other interest income resulted primarily from an increase of 27.3 million in the average balance of short term investments to 110.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 83.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 145.3 million, to 1.31 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.17 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 39 basis points to 5.14 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.75 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 2.8 million, or 34.5 , to 10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased 3.0 million, or 50.5 , to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of 165.7 million, or 23.2 , to 879.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 713.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as well as an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits of 73 basis points to 3.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.25 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on FHLB advances decreased 168,000, or 7.5 , to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of FHLB advances of 15.1 million, or 6.8 , to 208.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 223.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a decrease in the cost of FHLB advances of 2 basis points to 3.95 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.97 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income increased 205,000, or 3.4 , to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 145.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in net interest margin of 15 basis points to 1.85 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities that exceeded the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets resulting from the significant increase in market interest rates that directly impact our funding costs. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. Based on management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for credit losses of 46,000 was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit for credit losses of 184,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision was driven by higher loan growth during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2023 included a shift in the mix of our loan portfolio to loan segments with lower estimated credit loss reserve requirements. 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased 18,000, or 5.6 , to 304,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 322,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by lower income from bank-owned life insurance as the third quarter of 2023 included a 72,000 gain recognized into income from a life insurance policy death benefit. Partially offsetting this decrease were increases in both net gains on sales of loans and customer service fees. The table below sets forth our noninterest income for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased 200,000, or 4.2 , to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Significant changes are as follows: 
 Salaries and employee benefits increased 288,000, or 9.9 , driven by 245,000 in stock based compensation recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024, related to the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. There were no stock based compensation costs recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023 as the employee stock awards were granted in the fourth quarter of 2023; 

Director compensation increased 70,000, or 50.4 , driven by 83,000 in stock based compensation recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 20,000 in stock based compensation recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The director stock awards were granted at the end of the three months ended September 30, 2023; 

Advertising and promotions decreased 42,000, or 20.9 . We have strategically reduced certain advertising costs in an effort to manage overall noninterest expenses; and 

Professional fees decreased 64,000, or 21.1 , primarily due to higher legal and consulting costs during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to operating a new publicly traded company.

Rate/Volume Analysis. The following tables present the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior period volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net Income. We recorded net income of 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net income was driven by an increase in noninterest expense as well as a decrease in net interest and dividend income, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses as well as higher noninterest income. 
 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 9.4 million, or 23.5 , to 49.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a 7.1 million increase in interest and fees on loans, a 396,000 increase in interest and dividends on investment securities and a 1.9 million increase in interest on short term investments. The increase in interest and fees on loans was driven by an increase of 111.1 million in the average balance of the loan portfolio to 1.09 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 981.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as well as an increase in the average yield of 37 basis points to 5.19 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.82 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 benefited from new loans with higher rates as well as adjustable rate loans repricing higher. The increase in interest and dividend income on investment securities was driven by an increase in the yield on securities of 36 basis points to 2.88 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.52 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other interest income resulted primarily from an increase of 40.9 million in the average balance of short term investments to 108.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 67.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as an increase in the yield on short term investments of 35 basis points to 5.45 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.10 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in yield was driven by increases in the rate paid on reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 
 Average interest-earning assets increased 150.4 million, to 1.28 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.13 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 40 basis points to 5.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 10.0 million, or 47.6 , to 31.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased 
 38 

9.7 million, or 65.2 , to 24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of 150.5 million, or 21.8 , to 839.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 688.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits of 102 basis points to 3.90 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.88 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on FHLB advances increased 337,000, or 5.4 , to 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances of 6.1 million, or 2.8 , to 219.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 213.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as an increase in the cost of FHLB advances of 10 basis points to 3.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in FHLB advances was used to fund loan growth and for liquidity management. 
 Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income decreased 646,000, or 3.4 , to 18.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the net interest margin of 35 basis points to 1.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.18 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities that exceeded the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets resulting from the significant increase in market interest rates that directly impact our funding costs. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. Based on management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for credit losses of 485,000 was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of 696,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was driven by lower loan growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased 107,000, or 13.5 , to 898,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 791,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by increases in net gains on sales of loans and customer service fees.

 Salaries and employee benefits increased 1.0 million, or 11.8 , driven by 729,000 in stock based compensation recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. There were no stock based compensation costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to this plan as the employee stock awards were granted in the fourth quarter of 2023; 

Director compensation increased 247,000, or 65.2 , driven by 248,000 in stock based compensation recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 20,000 in stock based compensation costs recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The director stock awards were granted at the end of the third quarter of 2023; 

Occupancy and equipment costs increased 93,000, or 13.4 , primarily due to our new branch in Woburn, MA; 

Advertising and promotions decreased 180,000, or 31.3 . We have strategically reduced certain advertising costs in an effort to manage overall noninterest expenses; and 

Professional fees decreased 131,000, or 13.6 , primarily due to higher legal and consulting costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to operating a new publicly traded company.

Rate/Volume Analysis. The following tables present the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior period volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We are also able to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the Federal Reserve Bank and the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding advances of 234.0 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At September 30, 2024, we had unused borrowing capacity of 274.2 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank, 15.1 million with the Federal Reserve Bank and 10.0 million with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank. 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing and investing activities during any given period. 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 34.3 million in loan commitments outstanding. In addition to commitments to originate and purchase loans, we had 78.0 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers and 47.0 million in unadvanced construction loans. 
 Non brokered certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled 259.8 million, or 27.5 , of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we may be required to seek other sources of funds, including brokered deposits and FHLB advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2025, or on our savings and money market accounts. 
 We believe, however, based on historical experience and current market interest rates that we will retain upon maturity a large portion of our certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less as of September 30, 2024. 
 42 

Our primary investing activity is originating loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we originated and purchased 149.3 million and 268.1 million of loans, respectively. 
 
 Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances. We experienced net increases in deposits of 76.1 million and 150.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the level of brokered time deposits was 125.6 million and 115.5 million, respectively. Deposit flows are affected primarily by the overall level of interest rates and the interest rates and products offered by us and our competitors. FHLB advances stayed unchanged for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an increase of 60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 For additional information, see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included as part of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We continuously monitor our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate by management. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding planning process, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. In addition, based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, Everett Co-operative Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, and was categorized as well-capitalized at that date. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification of well-capitalized status that would change our category. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 
 Item 3. Quantita tive and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable, as the Registrant is a smaller reporting company. 
 Item 4. C ontrols and Procedures

Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
