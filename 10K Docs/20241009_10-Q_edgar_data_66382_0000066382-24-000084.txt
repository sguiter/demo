 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has more likely than not declined below its carrying value. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to bypass the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. 
 Each of the reporting units, other than the Global Retail reporting unit, was reviewed for impairment using a qualitative assessment as of March 31, 2024, our annual testing date. The Global Retail reporting unit was reviewed for impairment using a quantitative assessment as of March 31, 2024. In performing the qualitative and quantitative impairment tests for fiscal year 2024, the Company determined that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded the carrying amount and, as such, these reporting units were not impaired. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company performed an assessment to determine whether there were indicators of a triggering event which could indicate the carrying amount of the reporting units may not be supported by the fair value. No indicators of a triggering event for potential impairment were noted in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 The Company generally uses the discounted cash flow method under a weighting of the income and market approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These approaches are based on a discounted cash flow analysis and observable comparable company information that use several inputs, including: 
 actual and forecasted revenue growth rates and operating margins, 
 discount rates based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, and 
 revenue and EBITDA of comparable companies. 
 The Company selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, management s long-term strategic plans, and guideline companies.

 and , respectively, for the three month periods ended August 31, 2024, and September 2, 2023. The year over year change in the effective tax rate for the three months ended August 31, 2024, resulted from the current quarter reflecting pre-tax loss along with having favorable discrete impacts from stock compensation and return to provision true-ups related to the United States research and development tax credit and the prior year quarter reflecting pre-tax income with unfavorable discrete impacts related to stock compensation. 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024, the effective tax rate is higher than the United States federal statutory rate due to reflecting pre-tax loss along with favorable discrete impacts from stock compensation in the United States research and development tax credit. For the three months ended September 2, 2023, the effective tax rate was higher than the United States federal statutory rate due to an unfavorable discrete tax adjustment in the quarter related to stock compensation in the United States. 
 
 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits through Income tax expense in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Interest and penalties recognized in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income were negligible for the three months ended August 31, 2024, and September 2, 2023.

Liability for uncertain tax positions, current 
 The Company is subject to periodic audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Currently, the Company is undergoing routine periodic audits in both domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these audits. Tax payments related to these audits, if any, are not expected to be material to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
 For the majority of tax jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to state, local, or non-United States income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years before 2019.

 Fair value 
 The following describes the methods the Company uses to estimate the fair value of financial assets and liabilities recorded in net earnings, which have not significantly changed in the current period: 
 Cash and cash equivalents The Company invests excess cash in short term investments in the form of money market funds, which are valued using net asset value ("NAV"). 
 Deferred compensation plan The Company's deferred compensation plan primarily includes various domestic and international mutual funds that are recorded at fair value using quoted prices for similar securities. 
 Foreign currency exchange contracts The Company's foreign currency exchange contracts are valued using an approach based on foreign currency exchange rates obtained from active markets. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is based on month-end spot rates as adjusted by market-based current activity. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.

 Guarantees 
 The Company is periodically required to provide performance bonds to do business with certain customers. These arrangements are common in the industry and generally have terms ranging between and . The bonds are required to provide assurance to customers that the products and services they have purchased will be installed and/or provided properly and without damage to their facilities. The bonds are provided by various bonding agencies. However, the Company is ultimately liable for claims that may occur against them. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had a maximum financial exposure related to performance bonds totaling approximately million. The Company has no history of claims, nor is it aware of circumstances that would require it to pay, under any of these arrangements. The Company also believes that the resolution of any claims that might arise in the future, either individually or in the aggregate, would not materially affect the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, liability has been recorded in respect to these bonds as of either August 31, 2024, or June 1, 2024. 
 The Company has entered into standby letter of credit arrangements for purposes of protecting various insurance companies and lessors against default on insurance premium and lease payments. As of August 31, 2024, the Company had a maximum financial exposure from these standby letters of credit totaling approximately million, all of which is considered usage against the Company's revolving line of credit. The Company has no history of claims, nor is it aware of circumstances that would require it to perform under any of these arrangements and believes that the resolution of any claims that might arise in the future, either individually or in the aggregate, would not materially affect the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, liability has been recorded with respect to these arrangements as of August 31, 2024, or June 1, 2024. 
 Contingencies 
 The Company is also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not have a material adverse effect, if any, on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

 In connection with the acquisition of Knoll, in July 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement that provided for a syndicated revolving line of credit and term loans. The revolving line of credit provides the Company with up to million in revolving variable rate interest borrowing capacity that matures in July 2026, replacing the previous million syndicated revolving line of credit. The term loans consist of a senior secured term loan "A" facility with an aggregate principal amount of million and a senior secured term loan "B" facility with an aggregate principal amount of million, the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of Knoll, and to pay fees, costs, and expenses related thereto. In January 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment to the credit agreement which transitioned the benchmark rate from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") for U.S. dollar borrowings. SOFR is the recommended risk-free reference rate of the Federal Reserve Board and Alternative Reference Rates Committee, as defined within the credit agreement. The indebtedness incurred under the revolving line of credit and term loans is secured by substantially all of the Company s tangible and intangible assets, including, without limitation, the Company s intellectual property. The Company s direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries have also guaranteed the obligations of the Company and the foreign borrowers under the revolving line of credit and term loans and pledged substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets as security for their obligations under such guarantee. 
 During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company made total principal payments on term loans "A" and "B" in the amounts of million and million, respectively. During the three months ended September 2, 2023, the Company made total principal payments on term loans "A" and "B" in the amounts of million and million, respectively.

 Supplier Financing Program 
 The Company has an agreement with a third-party financial institution that allows certain participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations of the Company. Under this program, participating suppliers may finance payment obligations of the Company, prior to their scheduled due dates, at a discounted price to the third-party financial institution. 
 The Company has lengthened the payment terms for certain suppliers that have chosen to participate in the program. As a result, certain amounts due to suppliers have payment terms that are longer than standard industry practice and as such, these amounts have been excluded from Accounts payable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the amounts have been accounted for by the Company as current debt, within Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt. As of August 31, 2024, and June 1, 2024, the liability related to the supplier financing program was million and million, respectively.

 Net sales were 861.5 million and orders were 935.9 million, representing a decrease of 6.1 and increase of 2.4 , respectively, when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. On an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of the closure of the HAY eCommerce channel in North America, Net sales were 864.3 million ) and orders were 940.4 million ) , representing an organic decrease of 5.3 ) and increase of 3.5 ) , respectively, when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. 
 Gross margin in the first quarter was 39.0 which is flat when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. Benefits from pricing actions, favorable business and product mix and the realization of synergies associated with the Knoll acquisition offset the loss of leverage of fixed operating costs on lower sales volumes. 
 Operating expenses increased by 3.3 million or 1.0 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher Knoll integration costs as compared to the same period in the prior year, offset in part by a reduction in restructuring costs, reduced variable-selling costs on lower sales volume and the realization of savings related to integration and restructuring actions. 
 The effective tax rate was 66.2 compared to 24.4 for the same quarter of the prior year. The current quarter rate resulted from the current quarter reflecting a pre-tax loss along with return to provision true-ups recorded in the current period compared to the prior year.

 The following summary includes the Company's view of the economic environment in which it operates: 
 MillerKnoll finished the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 with demand improvement within the Americas Contract and International Contract Specialty segments. This improvement in order volume was driven by a general increase in day-to-day and project activity, including a ramp-up in larger project opportunities in the Americas and Asia. Demand in the Global Retail segment continues to reflect the impact of a tepid housing market, though the segment saw margin improvement in the quarter driven by investments in strengthening operational capabilities. 
 The Americas Contract segment in the first quarter reported Net sales totaling 454.6 million, down 7.3 compared to the prior year period on a reported basis and down 7.0 ) organically. Americas Contract had new orders of 512.7 million, which was an increase of 5.2 from the prior year and and increase of 5.7 ) on an organic basis.

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This report contains non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to the related GAAP measurement. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. We compensate for these limitations by providing equal prominence of our GAAP results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included within this report. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful for investors as they provide financial information on a more comparative basis for the periods presented. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures referenced within this report include: Adjusted Earnings per Share and Organic Growth (Decline). 
 Adjusted Earnings per Share represents reported diluted earnings per share excluding the impact from amortization of Knoll purchased intangibles, integration charges, restructuring expenses, Knoll pension plan termination charges and the related tax effect of these adjustments. These adjustments are described further below. 
 Organic Growth (Decline) represents the change in sales and orders, excluding currency translation effects and the impact of the closure of the HAY eCommerce channel in North America. 
 The adjustments made to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows: 
 Amortization of Knoll Purchased Intangibles: Includes expenses associated with the amortization of acquisition related intangibles acquired as part of the Knoll acquisition. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. We exclude the impact of the amortization of Knoll purchased intangibles as such non-cash amounts were significantly impacted by the size of the Knoll acquisition. Furthermore, we believe that this adjustment enables better comparison of our results as Amortization of Knoll Purchased Intangibles will not recur in future periods once such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. Although we exclude the Amortization of Knoll Purchased Intangibles in these non-GAAP measures, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. 
 Integration Charges: Knoll integration-related costs include severance, accelerated stock-based compensation expenses, asset impairment charges associated with lease and operations facility consolidation activity, and expenses related to synergy realization efforts and reorganization initiatives. 
 Restructuring charges: Includes costs associated with actions involving targeted workforce reductions. 
 Knoll pension plan termination charges: Includes expenses incurred associated with the termination of the Knoll pension plan. 
 Tax related items: We excluded the income tax benefit/provision effect of the tax related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our ongoing operating results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The table below summarizes the net change in Cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended as indicated. 
 (In millions) August 31, 2024 September 2, 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 21.1 130.9 Investing activities (22.3) (26.3) Financing activities (20.3) (111.1) Effect of exchange rate changes 0.8 0.5 Net change in Cash and cash equivalents (20.7) (6.0) 
 Cash Flows - Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended August 31, 2024, totaled 21.1 million compared to 130.9 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in cash inflow is due primarily to lower net income and changes in working capital. Our working capital consists primarily of receivables from customers, inventory, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued compensation, and accrued other expenses. Working capital changes were primarily affected by payment of variable compensation in the current quarter as well as timing of collection of our receivables. 
 Cash Flows - Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2024, was 22.3 million, as compared to 26.3 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in cash outflow in the current year, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to a decrease in the total volume of notes receivable entered into with certain independently owned dealers in the current quarter as compared to the same period of the prior year, offset in part by increased capital expenditures in the quarter. 
 At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, there were outstanding commitments for capital purchases of 14.5 million. The Company plans to fund these commitments through a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations. The Company expects full-year capital purchases to be between 100 million and 125 million, which will be primarily related to investments in the Company's facilities and equipment. This compares to full-year capital spending of 78.4 million in fiscal 2024. Capital expenditures for the first three months of fiscal 2025 were 22.6 million compared to 19.9 million for the three months ended September 2, 2023. 
 Cash Flows - Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2024, was 20.3 million, as compared to 111.1 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in cash used in the current quarter, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to: 
 Net borrowings on the credit agreement of 43.1 million in the current year compared to net payments of 59.4 million in the same period of the prior year. 
 The Company repurchased 1,544,733 shares at a cost of 43.7 million in the current year as compared to 1,670,135 share repurchases totaling 32.0 million in the same period of the prior year.

Outstanding borrowings bear interest at rates based on the prime rate, federal funds rate, SOFR or negotiated terms as outlined in the agreement. 
 As of August 31, 2024, the total debt outstanding related to borrowings under the syndicated revolving line of credit was 433.1 million with available borrowings on this facility of 278.7 million. 
 The Company intends to repatriate 104.3 million of undistributed foreign earnings all of which is held in cash in certain foreign jurisdictions with the remainder of undistributed earnings outside the U.S. recorded in working capital. The Company has recorded a 3.7 million deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding taxes on these future dividends received in the U.S. from foreign subsidiaries. A significant portion of the 104.3 million of undistributed foreign earnings was previously taxed under the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA). The Company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested in the remaining undistributed earnings outside the U.S. which is estimated to be approximately 347.5 million on August 31, 2024.

 Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 1, 2024, has not changed materially. The nature of market risks from interest rates and commodity prices has not changed materially during the first three months of fiscal 2025. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 The Company primarily manufactures its products in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, China, Italy, India, Mexico, and Brazil. It also sources completed products and product components from outside the United States. The Company's completed products are sold in numerous countries around the world. Sales in foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the Company's reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, production costs and profit margins related to these sales are affected by the currency exchange relationship between the countries where the sales take place and the countries where the products are sourced or manufactured. These currency exchange relationships can also impact the Company's competitive positions within these markets. 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The principal foreign currencies in which the Company conducts its business are the British pound sterling, Euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese renminbi, and the Danish krone. Changes in the fair value of such contracts are reported in earnings in the period the value of the contract changes. The net gain or loss upon settlement and the change in fair value of outstanding contracts is recorded as a component of Other (income) expense.

(b) The Committee may make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment in the number of Target Performance Share Units granted under this Award Agreement if the outstanding shares of Common Stock are increased or decreased as a result of a recapitalization or reorganization not included within Section 6(a) above. 7. Deferral of Distribution. The Participant may elect to defer the conversion of Actual Performance Share Units granted under this Award Agreement into Common Stock and the issuance of such Common Stock with respect thereto to a time later than that provided under Section 4(a). The Participant must file such election with the Committee at least 12 months prior to the end of the Performance Period. The Participant must specify in the election the date on which the Actual Performance Share Units earned under this Award Agreement will be converted to Common Stock and issued to the Participant. The date elected must be at least five (5) years later than the date on which the Actual Performance Share Units would have been converted to Common Stock and issued to the Participant under Section 4(a). 

9 8. Tax Withholding. (a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to Tax Related-Items, the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Related-Items associated with the Actual Performance Share Units are and remains the Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and that the Company and the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Related-Items in connection with any aspect of the Actual Performance Share Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Actual Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Actual Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability for Tax Related-Items. Further, if the Participant is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax Related-Items in more than one jurisdiction. (b) Prior to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock upon settlement of the Actual Performance Share Units, if the Participant s country of residence (and/or the Participant s country of employment, if different) requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company shall withhold a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon settlement of the Performance Share Units that have an aggregate Fair Market Value sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld. In cases where the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Common Stock withheld is greater than the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld, the Company shall make a cash payment to the Participant equal to the difference as soon as administratively practicable. The cash equivalent of the shares of Common Stock withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items. Alternatively, the Company may permit the Participant to tender payment of the Tax- Related Items to the Company (i) in the form of cash, check (bank check, certified check or personal check) or money order payable to the Company, (ii) in the form of unencumbered shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months, (iii) causing the broker to sell from the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Participant having an aggregate Fair Market Value necessary to satisfy the amount of Tax-Related Items due, or (iv) by having the Company or the Employer withhold the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the shares of Common Stock in cash from the Participant s regular salary/wages, or from any other amounts payable to the Participant. In the event the withholding requirements for Tax- Related Items are not satisfied through any of the foregoing methods, no shares of Common Stock will be issued to the Participant (or the Participant s estate) upon settlement of the Performance Share Units unless and until satisfactory arrangements have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company and the Employer determine, in their sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such Performance Share Units. 

10 (c) Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax Related-Items by considering maximum applicable rates to the extent permitted by the Plan, in which case the Participant may receive a refund of any over- withheld amount in cash from the applicable taxing authority and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax Related-Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, the Participant shall be deemed to have been issued the full member of shares of Common Stock issued upon settlement of the Performance Share Units notwithstanding that a member of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Related-Items. (d) By accepting the Performance Share Units, the Participant expressly consents to the foregoing methods of tax withholding for Tax-Related Items associated with the Performance Share Units.

The portion of the Restricted Stock Units that shall vest upon the date of the Participant s Retirement will be determined by multiplying the sum of the Participant s Restricted Stock Units granted under this Award and any related Additional Restricted Stock Units by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 

4 number of days that Participant was employed by the Company or the Employer from the Award Date until the date of the Participant s Retirement, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the first 12 months after the Award Date. If the Participant terminates employment by reason of Retirement after the initial 12 month period, then all of the Participant s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall become immediately vested as of the date of such Retirement. (ii) Notwithstanding (i), if the Participant is a Key Employee (as defined below), such pro rata portion of the Participant s Restricted Stock Units shall become vested as provided above, but the conversion to Common Stock and the distribution of Common Stock to the Participant shall not occur until the earlier of: (A) The date which is six (6) months after the date of the Participant s Retirement, or (B) The date of the Participant s death.

(e) Mutual Agreement Termination. (i) If the Participant s employment by the Company or the Employer is terminated by reason of a Mutual Agreement Termination and the Participant does not otherwise satisfy the age and service requirements for Retirement, then a portion of the Participant s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall become immediately vested as of the date of the Participant's Mutual Agreement Termination. The portion of the Restricted Stock Units that shall vest will be determined by multiplying the sum of the Participant s Restricted Stock Units granted under this Award and any related Additional Restricted Stock Units by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that Participant was employed by the Company or the Employer from the Award Date until the date of the Participant s Mutual Agreement Termination, and the denominator of 

5 which is the number of days from the Award Date to the applicable Vesting Date. (ii) If the Participant s employment by the Company or the Employer is terminated by reason of a Mutual Agreement Termination within the first anniversary of the Award Date and the Participant satisfies the age and service requirements for Retirement, then a portion of the Participant s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall become immediately vested as of the date of the Participant's Mutual Agreement Termination. The portion of the Restricted Stock Units that shall vest will be determined by multiplying the sum of the Participant s Restricted Stock Units granted under this Award and any related Additional Restricted Stock Units by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that Participant was employed by the Company or the Employer from the Award Date until the date of the Participant s Mutual Agreement Termination, and the denominator of which is the number of days from the Award Date to the first anniversary of the Award Date. (iii) If the Participant s employment by the Company or the Employer is terminated by reason of a Mutual Agreement Termination on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date and the Participant satisfies the age and service requirements for Retirement, then all of the Participant s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall become immediately vested as of the date of the Participant's Mutual Agreement Termination. (f) For purposes of this Award Agreement, the Committee shall have discretion to determine whether the Participant has ceased to be actively employed by (or, if the Participant is a consultant or director, has ceased actively providing services to) the Company or a Subsidiary, and the effective date on which such active employment (or active service-providing relationship) terminated. The Participant s active employer-employee or other active service-providing relationship will not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law (e.g., active employment shall not include a period of garden leave , paid administrative leave or similar period pursuant to applicable law) and in the event of the Participant s termination of employment (whether or not in breach of applicable labor laws), the Participant s right to settle any Restricted Stock Units after termination of employment, if any, shall be measured by the date of termination of active employment or service and shall not be extended by any notice period mandated under applicable law. Unless the Committee provides otherwise (1) termination of the Participant s employment will include instances in which the Participant is terminated and immediately rehired as an independent contractor, and (2) the spin-off, sale, or disposition of the Employer from the Company or another Subsidiary (whether by transfer of shares, assets or otherwise) such that the Employer no longer constitutes a Subsidiary will constitute a termination of employment or service. (g) If the Participant is a resident or employed in a country that is a member of the European Union, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units and this Award Agreement is intended to comply with the age discrimination provisions of the EU Equal Treatment Framework Directive, as implemented into local law (the Age

Change in Control. Notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this Award Agreement or the Plan, if within two (2) years after a Change in Control the Participant s employment (a) is terminated without Cause, (b) terminates with Good Reason or (c) terminates under circumstances that entitle the Participant to accelerated vesting under any individual employment agreement between the Participant and the Company, a Subsidiary, or any successor thereof, then this Award (or its replacement) shall become fully vested upon the date of such termination of employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if upon the occurrence of a Change in Control this Award is not assumed or continued, then this Award shall be treated in accordance with Section 14.3(a) of the Plan. 6. Restriction on Transfer. Any rights under this Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and any such purported sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition will be void and unenforceable against the Company. 7. Adjustments to Restricted Stock Units for Certain Corporate Transactions. (a) The Committee will make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment to the number of Restricted Stock Units granted under this Award, if (i) the outstanding shares of Common Stock are increased or decreased, as a result of merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Company, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other securities, or (ii) additional shares or new or different shares for other securities are distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other securities or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities to merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to such shares of Common Stock or other securities. (b) The Committee may make an appropriate and proportionate adjustment in the number of Restricted Stock Units granted under this Award if the outstanding shares of Common Stock are increased or decreased as a result of a recapitalization or reorganization not included within Section 7(a) above. 8. Deferral of Distribution. The Participant may elect to defer the conversion of Restricted Stock Units granted under this Award and related Additional Restricted Stock Units into Common Stock and the issuance of such Common Stock with respect thereto to a time later than that provided under Section 2(c). The Participant must file such election with the Committee at least 12 months prior to the date provided under Section 2(c) that such Restricted Stock Units 

7 are scheduled to be converted into Common Stock and issued to the Participant. The Participant must specify in the election the date on which the Restricted Stock Units granted under this Award and the related Additional Restricted Stock Units will be converted to Common Stock and issued to the Participant. The date elected must be at least five (5) years later than the date on which the Restricted Stock Units would have been converted to Common Stock and issued to the Participant under Section 2(c). 9. Tax Withholding. (a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Employer takes with respect to Tax Related-Items, the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Related-Items associated with the Restricted Stock Units are and remains the Participant s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and that the Company and the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Related-Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant s liability for Tax Related-Items. Further, if the Participant is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax Related-Items in more than one jurisdiction. (b) Prior to the delivery of any shares of Common Stock upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, if the Participant s country of residence (and/or the Participant s country of employment, if different) requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company shall withhold a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units that have an aggregate Fair Market Value sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld. In cases where the Fair Market Value of the number of shares of Common Stock withheld is greater than the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld, the Company shall make a cash payment to the Participant equal to the difference as soon as administratively practicable. The cash equivalent of the shares of Common Stock withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items. Alternatively, the Company may permit the Participant to tender payment of the Tax-Related Items to the Company (i) in the form of cash, check (bank check, certified check or personal check) or money order payable to the Company, (ii) in the form of unencumbered shares of Common Stock already owned by the Participant for at least six (6) months, (iii) causing the broker to sell from the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Participant having an aggregate Fair Market Value necessary to satisfy the amount of Tax-Related Items due, or (iv) by having the Company or the Employer withhold the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the shares of Common Stock in cash from the Participant s regular salary/wages, or from any other amounts payable to the Participant. In the event the withholding requirements for Tax-Related Items are not satisfied through any of the foregoing methods, no shares of Common Stock will be issued to the Participant (or the Participant s estate) upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units 

8 unless and until satisfactory arrangements have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company and the Employer determine, in their sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such Restricted Stock Units. (c) Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax Related-Items by considering maximum applicable rates to the extent permitted by the Plan, in which case the Participant may receive a refund of any over- withheld amount in cash from the applicable taxing authority and will have no entitlement to the Share equivalent. If the obligation for Tax Related-Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, the Participant shall be deemed to have been issued the full member of shares of Common Stock issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units notwithstanding that a member of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Related-Items. (d) By accepting the Restricted Stock Units, the Participant expressly consents to the foregoing methods of tax withholding for Tax-Related Items associated with the Restricted Stock Units. All other Tax-Related Items related to the Restricted Stock Units and any shares of Common Stock delivered in payment thereof are the Participant s sole responsibility. 10. Participant Covenants.
