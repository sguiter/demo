 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

. 

B. 
 In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings, Ltd. Fat Shark ), a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was . 

C. 
 In May 2021, the Company acquired Skypersonic which provided hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is either denied or not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was 2,791,012. 

D. 
 In August 2021, the Company acquired Teal Drones, Inc. Teal ), a leader in commercial and government Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV technology. The purchase price was . 

E. 
 In September 2024, the Company acquired FlightWave Aerospace Systems Corporation,
an industry-leading provider of VTOL drone, sensor and software solutions, under an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA ). As
part of the acquisition, the Company created a new subsidiary, FW Acquisition Inc. FlightWave for ongoing operations.
The purchase price was . See Note 3 for additional information. 

Following the Teal acquisition
in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment Enterprise and the Consumer segment Consumer to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. Enterprise's
initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial enterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined
industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, Enterprise narrowed its near-term attention on the military and other government
agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal. 

On February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer
segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects the Company's decision to focus its efforts and
capital on defense where it believes that there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value. See Note 4 and Note 8.

During the six months ended October 31, 2023, three customers accounted for equal to or greater than 10 of total revenue, totaling 13 ,
12 and 10 , respectively. The Company does not believe the loss of one or more of these customers would be significant to operations. 

for the year ended April 30, 2024. See Note 8 for additional information. 

Convertible Notes Payable 

The Company measures its convertible notes payable
at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which caused them to be classified as Level 3 measurements within
the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair value of the convertible notes payable related to updated assumptions and estimates were
recognized as a convertible notes payable fair value adjustment within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

In determining the fair value of the convertible
notes payable as of October 31, 2024, the Company used a market-based approach. The valuation method utilized a negotiated discount rate
and a market yield rate which are unobservable inputs. 

An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable
inputs in isolation could result in a material increase or decrease in the estimated fair value. In the future, depending on the weight
of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on the estimated fair value. 

The Company calculated the estimated fair value of
the convertible notes payable as of October 31, 2024 using the following assumptions: 

Maturity
 date 

Stock
 price 

Expected
 volatility factor 

Risk-free
 interest rate 

The following table presents changes in the Level
3 convertible notes payable measured at fair value for the six months ended October 31, 2024: 

Fair value measurement adjustments 

Balance, October 31, 2024 

Warrants 

The fair value of the warrants as of October 31,
2024 was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The significant unobservable inputs for the Monte Carlo model include the stock
price, exercise price, risk-free rate of return, time to expiration, and the volatility. An increase or decrease in the unobservable
inputs in isolation could result in a material increase or decrease in the estimated fair value. In the future, depending on the weight
of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on the estimated fair value. Additionally,
if certain provisions are triggered, reset adjustments may be required in the future. For
the quarter ended October 31, 2024, no value was assigned to the warrants due to the fair market value of the convertible note payable
being in excess of the proceeds received.

. These financial results and our
financial position at October 31, 2024 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. However, the Company has recently taken actions to strengthen its liquidity. In November 2024, the Company was
selected as the winner of the U.S. Army s Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) Program of Record. The Company s manufacturing
facility is scaling production of its most recent products and gross profits are projected to increase. As described in Note 13 and Note
20, the Company closed financings with proceeds of approximately 
and 
in September 2024 and November 2024, respectively.
Additionally, the Company s Form S-3 became effective on December 11, 2024. If necessary, the Company will seek additional equity
financing for which there can be no guarantee. Management has concluded that these recent positive developments alleviate any substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue its operations, and meet its financial obligations, for twelve months from the
date these consolidated financial statements are issued.

worth of shares of the Company s common stock, and as such, the asset purchase will be treated as
a business combination. The purchase price is payable as follows: 

million worth of the Company s common stock issued on September 30, 2024, totaling shares, equal to the VWAP on such date. 

million worth of the Company s common stock to be issued on December 31, 2024, at a price per share equal to the VWAP on such date, of which (i) million will be payable to preferred shareholders of the Seller, and (ii) million will be payable to common shareholders and option-holders of the Seller as set forth the APA. 

The Company expects that the Goodwill recognized will
be deductible for tax purposes. The Company has reported net losses since its inception and is presently unable to determine when
and if the tax benefit of this deduction will be realized. 

The preliminary summary of the purchase price and
its related allocation is as follows: 

Acquisition consideration payable 

Total Purchase Price 

Assets acquired 

Accounts receivable 

Inventory 

Operating lease right-of-use assets 

Other assets 

Goodwill 

Total assets acquired 

Liabilities assumed 

Accounts payable and accrued expenses 

Customer deposits 

Operating lease liabilities 

Total liabilities assumed 

Total fair value of net assets acquired 

The foregoing amounts reflect our current estimates
of fair value as of the September 4, 2024 acquisition date. The Company expects to recognize fair values associated with the customer
relationships acquired, as well as the FlightWave proprietary technology and brand name, but has not yet accumulated sufficient information
to assign such values. As additional information becomes known regarding the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, management may make
adjustments to the opening balance sheet of the acquired company up to the end of the measurement period, which is a one-year period following
the acquisition date. The determination of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed (and the related determination
of estimated lives of depreciable tangible and intangible assets) requires significant judgment. 

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 

The
following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the results of operations for the Company as though the Business Combination
had occurred on May 1, 2023. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition taken place on the date indicated, or

Unusual Machines Securities 

The million worth of
UMAC common stock was valued at the IPO price for UMAC s common stock of 4.00 per share, resulting in
 shares of UMAC
common stock being issued to the Company (representing approximately 49 of UMAC s issued and outstanding common stock after giving
effect to the IPO and to the issuance of common stock to the Company upon closing of the IPO). 

Working Capital 

The purchase
price was adjusted for working capital as of the closing date. Actual working capital excess amounts increased the principal amount
of the Promissory Note dollar for dollar. Working capital as of closing was finalized at million
in July 2024. As a result, UMAC issued the Company 4,000,000 of its 8 Promissory Notes due November 30, 2025 (the New Notes reflecting (i) satisfaction and settlement of working capital adjustments and (ii) a maturity date extension to November 30, 2025.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read the following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled
 Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 as may be amended, supplemented
or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise
noted. 

Overview 

We are a technology company focused on developing
products, services, and solutions to the drone industry. We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado in 1984
under the name Oravest International, Inc. In November 2016, we changed our name to TimefireVR, Inc. and re-incorporated
in Nevada. In May 2019, we completed a share exchange agreement with Propware which resulted in the Propware shareholders acquiring an
83 ownership interest, and management control, of the Company. In connection with the share exchange agreement, we changed our name to
 Red Cat Holdings, Inc. , and our operating focus to the drone industry. 

Prior to the share exchange agreement, Propware was
focused on the research and development of software solutions that could provide secure cloud-based analytics, storage and services for
the drone industry. Following the share exchange agreement and name change, we have completed a series of acquisitions and financings
which have broadened the scope of our activities in the drone industry. 

Recent Developments 

On September 4, 2024, the
Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA with FlightWave Aerospace Systems Corporation (the Seller ).
The seller sold certain assets used in designing, developing, manufacturing, and selling long range, AI-powered UAVs for commercial use.
Pursuant to the APA, the Company has acquired substantially all of the assets owned, controlled or used by the Seller for an aggregate
purchase price of 14,000,000 worth of shares of the Company s common stock. See Note 3 for further information. 

On September 23, 2024, we entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the SPA with Lind Global Asset Management X LLC Lind ). Under the SPA, we received 8
million in funding from Lind in exchange for our issuance to Lind of a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the amount of 9,600,000
(the Note and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant for the purchase of 750,000 shares of our common stock at a price of 6.50
per share, exercisable for 5 years (the Warrant ). As additional consideration to Lind, we paid a commitment fee in the amount
of 280,000, which was paid by deduction from the funding to be received. The Note, which does not accrue interest, shall be repaid in
eighteen (18) consecutive monthly installments in the amount of 533,334 beginning March 23, 2024. See
Note 13 for further information. 

On
November 26, 2024, we entered into a First Amendment to our Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA Amendment with Lind.
The SPA Amendment amends the terms of our original Securities Purchase Agreement with Lind dated September 23, 2024. Upon closing of the
SPA Amendment, we received an additional 6,000,000 in funding from Lind in exchange for our issuance to Lind of a Senior Secured Convertible

Lind, we have agreed to pay a commitment fee in the amount of 210,000, which may be paid by deduction from the funding to be received.
 See Note 20 for further information. 

Plan of Operations 

Since April 2016, our primary business has been to
provide products, services, and solutions to the drone industry which we presently do through our three wholly owned subsidiaries Skypersonic,
Teal, and Propware. Beginning in January 2020, we expanded the scope of our drone products and services through five acquisitions, including: 

A. 
 In January 2020, we acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (FPV) drones and equipment, primarily to the consumer marketplace. The purchase price was 1,995,114. 

23 

B. 
 In November 2020, we acquired Fat Shark Holdings, a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was 8,354,076. 

C. 
 In May 2021, we acquired Skypersonic which provides hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was 2,791,012. 

D. 
 In August 2021, we acquired Teal, a leader in commercial and government UAV technology, primarily drones, to government and commercial enterprises, most notably, the military. Teal manufactures drones approved by the U.S. Department of Defense for reconnaissance, public safety, and inspection applications. The purchase price was 10,011,279. 

E. 
 In September 2024, the Company acquired FlightWave Aerospace Systems Corporation,
an industry-leading provider of VTOL drone, sensor and software solutions, under an Asset Purchase Agreement. As part of the acquisition,
the Company created a new subsidiary, FW Acquisition Inc. for ongoing operations The purchase price was 14,000,000. 

Following the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we
concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment Enterprise and the Consumer segment Consumer to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. Enterprise's initial strategy was
to provide UAVs to commercial enterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial
interior spaces. Subsequently, Enterprise narrowed its near-term attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's
technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal. 

The Enterprise segment s current business strategy
is focused on providing integrated robotic hardware and software for use across a variety of applications. Its solutions provide critical
situational awareness and actionable intelligence to on-the-ground warfighters and battlefield commanders as well as firefighters and
public safety officials. Our Enterprise segment s efforts are centered on developing and scaling an American made family of systems.
We have since completed construction of a manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah and believe that an increased focus by the United
States government and American businesses on purchasing products that are Made in America provide our Enterprise segment
with a competitive advantage. 

On February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer
segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects our decision to focus our efforts and capital
on defense where we believe there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value. 

Results of Operations 

The analysis of our results
of operations for the three and six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2023 includes
only our Enterprise segment as our Consumer segment was divested in February 2024. 

Discussion and Analysis
of Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 compared to Three Months Ended October 31, 2023 

Revenues 

Consolidated revenues totaled
 1,534,727 during the three months ended October 31, 2024 (or the 2024 period compared to 3,930,868 during the three months
ended October 31, 2023 (or the 2023 period representing a decrease of 2,396,141, or 61 . The decrease related to lower
product revenue and lower contract revenue as the Company has begun shifting manufacturing focus from the Teal 2 to the Black Widow. Product
revenue totaled 1,524,791 during the quarter ended October 31, 2024 compared to 3,383,238 during the quarter ended October 31, 2023
representing a decrease of 1,858,447, or 55 . There were no contract revenues during the 2024 period compared to 529,438 during
the 2023 period, representing a decrease of 529,438, or 100 . Contract revenues are primarily sourced through government agencies
and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of award deliverables and amendments. 

24 

Gross Profit 

Consolidated gross loss
totaled 23,475 during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of 1,200,582 during the 2023 period representing a decrease of 1,224,057,
or 102 . On a percentage basis, gross loss was 2 during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of 31 during the 2023 period. The
gross loss in the 2024 period was due to lower-than-planned manufacturing levels due to the transition to the Black Widow which resulted
in higher relative overhead costs compared to the 2023 period. Our manufacturing facility is presently producing drones at a lower level
than it is designed for, and these lower production levels, combined with higher overhead costs, continue to result in lower than targeted
gross margins. 

Operating Expenses 

Research and development expenses totaled 2,231,470
during the 2024 period compared to 2,222,137 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 9,333, or 0.5 . 

Sales and marketing costs totaled 2,343,779 during
the 2024 period compared to 1,032,645 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 1,311,134 or 127 . The increase was driven
by higher payroll expenses due to an increased headcount and an increase in tradeshow attendance in efforts to spread awareness of new
products and the Red Cat Futures Initiative. 

General and administrative expenses totaled 4,517,695
during the 2024 period compared to 2,838,080 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 1,679,615 or 59 . The increase was
mainly due to a higher headcount, including the addition of employees from the FlightWave acquisition. In anticipation of winning the
production contract under the Army s Short Range Reconnaissance program of record, the Company increased investment in personnel
necessary to fulfill the contract as well as anticipated demands for future products. 

During the 2024 period, we incurred stock-based compensation
costs of 1,304,037 compared to 1,196,325 in the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of 107,712 or 9 . 

Other Income 

Other expense totaled 4,218,199 during the 2024 period
compared to 352,019 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 3,866,180 or more than 10 times. This increase is primarily
related to a loss of 4,230,307 recognized in the 2024 period on the issuance of the Note to Lind, based on its fair value. 

Net Loss from Continuing Operations 

Net loss from continuing operations totaled 13,334,618
for the 2024 period compared to 5,244,299 for the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of 8,090,319 or 154 . Total operating expenses
totaled 9,092,944 for the 2024 period compared to 6,092,862 for the 2023 period. This increase of 3,000,082 or 49 , related to the
increase in sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. 

Discussion and Analysis
of Six Months Ended October 31, 2024 compared to Six Months Ended October 31, 2023 

Revenues 

Consolidated revenues totaled
 4,311,262 during the six months ended October 31, 2024 (or the 2024 period compared to 5,678,997 during the six months
ended October 31, 2023 (or the 2023 period representing a decrease of 1,367,735, or 24 . The decrease related to lower
product revenue. Product revenue totaled 3,359,991 during the 2024 period compared to 4,796,365 during the 2023 period representing a
decrease of 1,436,374, or 30 . 

25 

Gross Profit 

Consolidated gross loss
totaled 506,866 during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of 1,375,247 during the 2023 period representing a decrease of 1,882,113,
or 137 . On a percentage basis, gross loss was 12 during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of 24 during the 2023 period. The
gross loss in the 2024 period was due primarily to the delivery of final prototypes under the Short Range Reconnaissance Tranche 2 contract
with the U.S. Army which occurred in the first quarter. This is also due to lower-than-planned manufacturing levels in the transition
to the Black Widow which resulted in higher relative overhead costs compared to the 2023 period. Our manufacturing facility is presently
producing drones at a lower level than it is designed for, and these lower production levels, combined with higher overhead costs, continue
to result in lower than targeted gross margins. 

Operating Expenses 

Research and development expenses totaled 3,857,910
during the 2024 period compared to 3,575,688 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 282,222, or 8 . The increase was primarily
driven by the increased investment in the development of new products as well as the FlightWave acquisition. 

Sales and marketing costs totaled 4,385,290 during
the 2024 period compared to 2,321,405 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 2,063,885 or 89 . The increase was driven
by higher payroll expenses due to an increased headcount and an increase in tradeshow attendance in efforts to spread awareness of new
products and the Red Cat Futures Initiative. 

General and administrative expenses totaled 8,000,790
during the 2024 period compared to 5,701,838 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 2,298,952 or 40 . The increase was
mainly due to a higher headcount, including the addition of employees from the FlightWave acquisition. In anticipation of winning the
production contract under the Army s Short Range Reconnaissance program of record, the Company increased investment in personnel
necessary to fulfill the contract as well as anticipated demands for future products. 

During the 2024 period, we incurred stock-based compensation
costs of 2,750,075 compared to 2,107,931 in the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of 642,144 or 30 . 

Other Income 

Other expense totaled 8,907,088 during the 2024 period
compared to 614,910 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 8,292,178 or more than 13 times. This increase is primarily
related to a loss incurred on the sale of our equity method investment of 4,008,357 as well as a loss of 4,230,307 recognized on the
issuance of the Note to Lind, based on its fair value. 

Net Loss from Continuing Operations 

Net loss from continuing operations totaled 25,750,994
for the 2024 period compared to 10,838,594 for the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of 14,912,400 or 138 . Total operating expenses
totaled 16,337,040 for the 2024 period compared to 11,598,931 for the 2023 period. This increase of 4,738,109 or 41 , related to the
increase in sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. 

Cash Flows 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 12,487,713
during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in operating activities of 11,240,359 during the 2023 period, representing an increase
of 1,247,354 or 11 . The increased use of cash primarily related to timing of accounts receivable receipts for government customers.
Net cash used in operations, net of non-cash expenses, totaled 13,088,786 during the 2024 period, compared to 7,427,197 during the 2023
period, resulting in an increase of 5,661,589, or 76 . Net cash used related to changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled 601,073
during the 2024 period, compared to negative 3,813,162 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of 4,414,235 or 116 . Changes
in operating assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the timing and level of multiple
factors, including inventory purchases, vendor payments, and customer collections. 

26 

Investing Activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities was 4,276,207
during the 2024 period compared to net cash provided by investing activities of 10,065,641 during the 2023 period, resulting in a decrease
of 5,789,434 or 58 . During the 2023 period, proceeds of marketable securities were approximately 10,200,000 compared to 0 during the
2024 period. During the 2024 period, we received proceeds of 4,400,000 from the sale of equity method investment. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
 6,755,429 during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in financing activities of 286,206 during the 2023 period. The increase related
to the proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes payable during the 2024 period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At October 31, 2024, we reported current assets totaling
 20,913,163, current liabilities totaling 14,672,706 and net working capital of 6,240,457. Cash totaled 4,611,092 at October 31, 2024. Inventory
related balances, including pre-paid inventory, totaled 12,554,330. 

Going Concern 

We have never
been profitable and have incurred net losses related to acquisitions, as well as costs incurred to pursue its long-term growth strategy.
During the six months ended October 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of approximately 25,750,000 and used cash in operating activities
of approximately 12,500,000. As of October 31, 2024, working capital totaled approximately 6,240,000. These financial results and our
financial position at October 31, 2024 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. However, we have recently taken actions to strengthen our liquidity. In November 2024, the Company was selected
as the winner of the U.S. Army s Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) Program of Record. The Company s manufacturing facility
is scaling production of its most recent products and gross profits are projected to increase. As described in Note 13 and Note 20, the
Company closed financings with proceeds of approximately 8,000,000 and 6,000,000 in September 2024 and November 2024, respectively.
Additionally, the Company s Form S-3 became effective on December 11, 2024. If necessary, the Company will seek additional equity
financing for which there can be no guarantee. Management has concluded that these recent positive developments alleviate any substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue its operations, and meet its financial obligations, for twelve months from the
date these consolidated financial statements are issued. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. 

We regularly evaluate the
accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in
the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party
professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could
differ from those estimates made by management. 

Significant estimates reflected in these financial
statements include those used to (i) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, (ii) the evaluation of long-term assets, including
goodwill, for impairment, (iii) the evaluation of other-than-temporary-impairment of equity method investments, and (iv) valuations of
convertible notes payable. 

27 

Goodwill and Long-lived
Assets Goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in an acquisition that are
not individually identified and separately recognized. We test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of ASC
350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, ASC 350 ). Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at
the reporting unit level or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. ASC 350 provides that
an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a
determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing
the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it
is required to perform an impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its
book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If, however,
the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the amount that
the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 

The estimate of fair value
of a reporting unit is computed using either an income approach, a market approach, or a combination of both. Under the income approach,
we utilize the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. Significant assumptions inherent in estimating
the fair values include the estimated future cash flows, growth assumptions for future revenues (including gross profit, operating expenses,
and capital expenditures), and a rate used to discount estimated future cash flow projections to their present value based on estimated
weighted average cost of capital (i.e., the selected discount rate). Our assumptions are based on historical data, supplemented by current
and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates, and management s plans. Under the market approach, fair value is derived
from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable
businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate and consider risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of
products and services. 

Fair Values, Inputs and
Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures The fair value measurements and disclosure
guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. In accordance with this guidance, we have categorized our recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair
value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. 

The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such
cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 

The guidance establishes
three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows: 

Level 1 :
Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date; 

 Level 2 :
Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and 

 Level 3 :
Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little
or no market data. 

Financial Instruments 

Our financial instruments mainly consist of cash,
accounts receivable, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, and convertible notes payable. The recorded carrying
amounts of cash, accounts receivable, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable are considered to approximate
their estimated fair values due to their short-term nature. Liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated
balance sheets consist of convertible notes payable. These items are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the
inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

28 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements
that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and
we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

We

12b-2 of the Exchange Act. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024, the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of October 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective, specifically pertaining to the quarter ended October 31, 2023 for which we restated items
related to the removal of the derivative liabilities. 

Management's quarterly report on internal control
over financial reporting. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance
with GAAP. Our accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under
the general oversight of the Board s audit committee. 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed our internal control over financial
reporting as of October 31, 2024. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the measures in the Internal-Control
Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. 

29 

Based on management s assessment using the
COSO criteria, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, specifically pertaining
to the quarter ended October 31, 2023 for which we restated items related to the removal of the derivative liabilities. The Company is
currently in the process of formalizing narratives and processes which are expected to mitigate these weaknesses, and has hired additional
personnel to strengthen the internal control environment. 

Changes In Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months
ended October 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits
of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business, some of which
may be material. Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. Other
than as described below, we do not believe that the outcome of any of our current legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

On May 9, 2024, Autonodyne LLC filed a complaint against
wholly-owned Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. The Complaint alleges a single cause
of action, asserting that Teal breached a Software Licensing Agreement between it and Autonodyne (the SLA by disclosing
confidential information contained in the SLA. Autonodyne alleges that it rightfully terminated the SLA, and at that point it became
entitled to 8.25 million of accelerated payments, pursuant to section 14.4(e) of the SLA. Teal Drones has answered the Complaint. Autonodyne
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was opposed by Red Cat s outside counsel. The court heard oral arguments on
October 10, 2024. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court advised the parties that the arguments and briefs would be taken under
advisement, and a decision issued later; a ruling is yet to be issued. As any litigation is subject to many uncertainties, it is not
possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this claim or to estimate the loss, if any, which may result. Accordingly, the outcome of
the claim is not yet determinable, and the extent to which an outflow of funds may be required to settle this possible obligation cannot
be reliably determined. The Company plans to vigorously assert defenses to the complaint. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risk
factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024 Annual Report ). There have been
no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks
described in our Annual Report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described
in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently
deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the
risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.
