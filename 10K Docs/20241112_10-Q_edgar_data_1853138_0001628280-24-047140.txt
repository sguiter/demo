Each Unit consists of Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant Public Warrant ). 
 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering: (i) the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants ), including Private Placement Warrants to cover over-allotments, for an aggregate purchase price of , in a private placement to Ares Acquisition Holdings II LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the Sponsor and (ii) the Sponsor extended to the Company a non-interest bearing promissory note of (the Base Overfunding Loan and an additional non-interest bearing promissory note of (the Over-allotment Overfunding Loan in connection with the sale of the Over-Allotment Units, for which both loans are collectively referred to as the Overfunding Loans, for a total outstanding balance of (see Note 4). 
 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement, per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the private placement and the Overfunding Loans were placed in a trust account Trust Account located in the United States and invested solely in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination; and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. 
 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. 
 
 The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding public shares (the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the consummation of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

per public share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and net of taxes paid or payable, if any). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The public shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 
 
 The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if it obtains the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of ordinary shares who attend and vote at a shareholder meeting. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Class B ordinary shares, and the Sponsor and the Company s officers and directors have agreed to vote any public shares acquired in or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or abstain from voting on the proposed transaction. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct conversion pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from converting its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company. 
 
 The Sponsor and the Company s officers and directors have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Class B ordinary shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) not to propose an amendment to (a) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to provide for the redemption of its public shares in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem of the Company s public shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Combination Period (as defined below) or (b) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless the Company provides the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 
 
 The Company has until April 25, 2025 to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to of interest income to pay liquidation expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which may expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 
 
 The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to its Class B ordinary shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or the Company s officers or directors acquire public shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such public shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commissions (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the public shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for

). 
 In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below (i) per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all material vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Management has evaluated the impact of persistent inflation and rising interest rates, financial market instability and certain geopolitical events. Management has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the risks and uncertainties related to or resulting from these events could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these risks and uncertainties. 
 
 Going Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and investments held in the Trust Account of consisting of cash and investments in U.S. government securities. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by the Company to pay taxes, and to pay up to 100,000 of any dissolution expenses. 
 
 The Company s liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a contribution of from the Sponsor to cover certain expenses in exchange for the issuance of the Class B ordinary shares, a loan of from the Sponsor pursuant to the Promissory Note (see Note 4), and the proceeds from the consummation of the private placement not held in the Trust Account. The Company repaid the Promissory Note in full on April 25, 2023. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor may provide the Company with Working Capital Loans (see Note 4). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loan. 
 
 Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation of the Trust Account, should a business combination not occur, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. Management plans to complete the initial Business Combination prior to the mandatory liquidation date of the Trust Account and expects to receive financing from the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor to meet its obligations through the time of liquidation of the Trust Account or the completion of the initial Business Combination. There is no financing that is currently committed and no assurance that the plans to consummate the initial Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the Company s inability to continue as a going concern.

Emerging Growth Company 
 
 The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s unaudited condensed financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 

The Company has 1,189,876 and 1,905,123 of cash as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company did not have cash equivalents held outside the Trust Account as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Investments Held in Trust Account 
 
 The Company s portfolio of investments is comprised solely of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligation. The Company s investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the condensed balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities are included in investment income on investments held in Trust

as a result of the Initial Public Offering (consisting of of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees, and 1,050,129 of other offering costs). 
 
 Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 
 
 The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Company s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Class A ordinary shares, subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Company s condensed balance sheets. 
 
 The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable Class A ordinary shares resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.

Through April 25, 2023, the Company effectuated a share surrender and share recapitalizations resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares, which would represent of the outstanding shares upon completion of the offering. The Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to Class B ordinary shares to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised in full so that the Class B ordinary shares would represent, on an as-converted basis, of the Company s issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On April 25, 2023, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase Units; thus,

Class B ordinary shares were no longer subject to forfeiture. On June 5, 2023, following the expiration of the remaining over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited Class B ordinary shares. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holders of the Class B ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments, as described in Note 6. 
 
 The Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Class B ordinary shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until the earlier of (i) after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or (ii) subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination, (a) if the last reported sale price of the Company s Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within any -trading day period commencing at least days after the Business Combination, or (b) subsequent to a Business Combination, the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company s shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. 
 
 Promissory Note 
 
 On March 19, 2021, the Company issued a promissory note to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate of to be used for the payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering (the Promissory Note ). On February 8, 2023, the Company amended the Promissory Note with an effective date as of December 31, 2021 to increase the principal up to . The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Company borrowed under the Promissory Note and fully repaid the Promissory Note on April 25, 2023. Borrowings under the Promissory Note were no longer available after consummation of the Initial Public Offering.

If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the th day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, but the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

 In addition, if (i) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Class B ordinary shares held by the Sponsor or its affiliates, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (ii) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest on such issuances, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (iii) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s ordinary shares during the trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates a Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.

 Overview 
 
 We are a blank check company formed on March 15, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Quarterly Report as our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 
 
 As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, we had 1,189,876 in our operating bank account. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of initial business combinations. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 
 
 Our registration statement for our Initial Public Offering was declared effective on April 20, 2023. On April 25, 2023, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 50,000,000 Units, including 5,000,000 Over-Allotment Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 500,000,000, and incurring offering costs of 28,550,129, of which 17,500,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions. 
 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the Private Placement of 14,300,000 Private Placement Warrants, including 1,000,000 Private Placement Warrants to cover over-allotments, for an aggregate purchase price of 14,300,000, to the Sponsor. 
 
 Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Private Placement and the Overfunding Loans, 505,000,000 10.10 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement and the Overfunding Loans were placed in the Trust Account located in the United States and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below. 
 
 We have until April 25, 2025 to complete a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to 100,000 of interest income to pay liquidation expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with

 respect to the Company s warrants, which may expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 All activity for the period from March 15, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 related to our formation and the preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial business combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 6,964,802, which consisted of investment income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 7,407,809, offset by general and administrative costs of 443,007. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 19,943,559, which consisted of investment income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 21,215,500, offset by general and administrative costs of 1,271,941. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 6,400,142, which consisted of investment income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 6,784,071, offset by general and administrative costs of 383,929. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 9,965,778, which consisted of investment income earned on investments held in Trust Account of 10,657,294, offset by general and administrative costs of 691,516. 
 
 Going Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,189,876 in our operating bank account and working capital of 863,999. 
 
 Our liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a contribution of 25,000 from our Sponsor to cover certain expenses in exchange for the issuance of the Class B ordinary shares, a loan of 366,781 from our Sponsor pursuant to the Promissory Note (see Note 4) and the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account. On April 25, 2023, the total balance of 366,781 of the Promissory Note was fully repaid to the Sponsor. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor may provide us with Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 
 
 In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, our management has determined that the mandatory liquidation of the Trust Account, should a business combination not occur, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. Our management plans to complete the initial Business Combination prior to the mandatory liquidation date of the Trust Account and expects to receive financing from our Sponsor or the affiliates of our Sponsor to meet its obligations through the time of liquidation of the Trust Account or the completion of the initial Business Combination. There is no financing that is currently committed and no assurance that our plans to consummate the initial business combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Trends Affecting Our Business 
 
 We continue to evaluate the impact of persistent inflation and rising interest rates, financial market instability and certain geopolitical events. Management has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the risks and uncertainties related to or resulting from these events could have a negative effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or ability to complete an initial Business Combination, we cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements or long-term liabilities.

 Administrative Service Fee 
 
 On April 20, 2023, we entered into an agreement to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of 16,667 for general and administrative services including office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the Trust Account to the public shareholders. 
 
 Underwriting Agreement and Advisory Agreement 
 
 The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of 17,500,000. The deferred fee will be waived by the underwriters in the event that we do not complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 
 
 On April 20, 2023, we also engaged Ares Management Capital Markets LLC, an affiliate of the Company s Sponsor, to provide consulting and advisory services to the Company in connection with the Initial Public Offering, for which it will receive a deferred advisory fee of 3,500,000, payable solely in the event that we complete the initial Business Combination. The fees payable to Ares Management Capital Markets LLC will be reimbursed from a portion of the fees to the underwriters. 
 
 Contingent Fees 
 
 We have entered into fee arrangement with a service provider pursuant to which certain transaction fees and service fees will become payable only if we consummate a Business Combination. If the Business Combination does not occur, we will not be required to pay these contingent fees. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of these contingent fees with the service provider was 732,045. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our unaudited condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting estimates: 
 
 Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption 
 
 We account for our Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity (deficit). Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 50,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of our condensed balance sheets. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. 
 
 Net Income Per Ordinary Share 
 
 We comply with the accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . We have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. 
 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 The calculation of diluted net income per share does not consider the effect of the public warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, because the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Our management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncement if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements. 
 
 JOBS Act 
 
 The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our unaudited condensed financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 
 Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we, our executive officers, directors, our Sponsor and its respective affiliates and/or any of their respective principals and employees are subject to legal proceedings, and as a result, incur significant costs and expenses in connection with such legal proceedings. 
 
 We and our Sponsor and its affiliates are also subject to extensive regulation, which, from time to time, results in requests for information from us or our Sponsor or its affiliates, or legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations against us or our Sponsor or its affiliates. We incur significant costs and expenses in connection with any such information requests, proceedings and investigations. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed by the Company with the SEC on February 28, 2024, except for the below additional risk which could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. 
 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 The current end date of our Combination Period, when a mandatory liquidation of the Trust Account would occur, is April 25, 2025. Under the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Combination Period in which we must consummate an initial business combination is 24 months, or such earlier date as our board of directors may approve, from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, though we may seek shareholder approval to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we must consummate an initial business combination. Although we intend to complete an initial business combination within the Combination Period, there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate an initial business combination by this time. If an initial business combination is not consummated by the end of our Combination Period, there will be a mandatory liquidation of the Trust Account. Accordingly, the company s management has determined that the mandatory liquidation of the Trust Account, should an initial business combination not occur, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial statements contained elsewhere in this report do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities 
 
 Unregistered Sales 
 
 We did not sell any equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Use of Proceeds 
 
 In connection with the Initial Public Offering, we incurred offering costs of 28,550,129 (including deferred underwriting commissions of 17,500,000). Other incurred offering costs consisted principally preparation fees related to the Initial Public Offering. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion, which amount will be payable upon consummation of the initial Business Combination, if consummated) and the Initial Public Offering expenses, 505,000,000 of the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the private placement and the Overfunding Loans were placed in the Trust Account . 
 
 There has been no material change in the planned use of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the private placement and the Overfunding Loans as is described in the Company s final prospectus related to the Initial Public Offering.
