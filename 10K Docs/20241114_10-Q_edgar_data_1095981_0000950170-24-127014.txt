million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company used net cash of million to fund its operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. To date, the Company s operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital from issuance of its common and preferred stocks, proceeds from its term loan, line of credit facility and grant funding. However, the Company has had, and will continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund its future clinical development programs and other operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital in the future. The Company s inability to raise additional cash would have a material and adverse impact on its operations and could cause the Company to default on its term loan. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. At the closing of the May 2024 Private Placement (as defined below), the Company received aggregate up-front gross proceeds of approximately million, before deducting fees and other expenses associated with the closing of the May 2024 Private Placement. None of the Series A and Series B Warrants issued in connection with May 2024 Private Placement were exercised as of September 30, 2024. See Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, Stockholders Deficit - May 2024 Private Placement, for further details. Nasdaq Listing Compliance On March 8, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq ), notifying the Company that it no longer complied with the requirement under Nasdaq Listing

Pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, as amended, the Company made interest only payments through , and thereafter was required to make payments of principal and accrued interest in equal monthly installments sufficient to amortize the Term Loan through June 1, 2024, the maturity date. On June 3, 2024, the Company paid off the Term Loan by making a final payment in an aggregate amount equal to approximately million , which included both the balance of outstanding principal and interest and the final payment fee due .

Interest payments thereunder are calculated on a monthly basis and, unless paid, are added to the outstanding balance under the Pershing Credit Facility. The proceeds under the Pershing Credit Facility are available for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. Volatility in the global markets could cause the interest rate to fluctuate from time to time increasing the Company s costs, or could cause Pershing to terminate the Company s ability to borrow funds. In addition, borrowings under the Pershing Credit Facility have the effect of limiting the Company s use of cash and marketable securities. 
 
 Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase shares of common stock, issued in connection with the May 2024 Private Placement (See Note 12, Stockholders Deficit - May 2024 Private Placement, for further details), were included in the basic and diluted net loss per share calculation.)

The Certificate of Designation provided that the share of Series F Preferred Stock would have votes per share of Series F Preferred Stock and would vote together with the Company s common stock, as a single class exclusively with respect to any proposal to amend the Company s certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split. On March 3, 2023, the Company entered into a subscription and investment representation agreement with Richard J. Hawkins, chairman of the board of the Company, who is an accredited investor (the Series F Preferred Stock Purchaser ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell one share of the Company s Series F Preferred Stock, par value per share, to the Series F Preferred Stock Purchaser for in cash. The sale closed on . The outstanding share of Series F Preferred Stock was redeemed in whole, automatically effective upon the approval by the Company s stockholders of the reverse stock split in April 2023. Upon such redemption, the Series F Preferred Stock Purchaser received consideration of in cash. On November 12, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination Certificate of Elimination with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware effecting the elimination of the Certificate of Designation relating to the Series F Preferred Stock. Following the filing of the Certificate of Elimination the previously-authorized share of the Series F Preferred Stock resumed the status of an undesignated share of the Company s preferred stock. Series B and C Preferred Stock As of September 30, 2024 , there were outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock that can be converted into an aggregate of shares of common stock, and shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock that can be converted into an aggregate of shares of common stock. Common Stock May 2024 Private Placement On May 5, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors, including certain of the Company s directors and executive officers Company Insiders (collectively, the Purchasers ), for the sale and issuance by the Company of its securities (the Initial Subscription ). On May 8, 2024, the Company entered into a first amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement (together with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement ), for the sale and issuance by the Company of additional securities to two of the Purchasers (the Additional Subscription , and together with the Initial Subscription, the May 2024 Private Placement ). The Purchase Agreement provides for the sale and issuance by the Company of an aggregate of shares (the Private Placement Shares of the Company s common stock or, at the election of each Purchaser, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), exercisable immediately at an exercise price of per share, with each Private Placement Share or Pre-Funded Warrant accompanied by (i) a Series A common warrant Series A Warrants to purchase one share of common stock, for an aggregate of Series A Warrants, and (ii) one Series B common warrant Series B Warrants to purchase one share of common stock, for an aggregate of Series B Warrants. The combined purchase price for each Private Placement Share and Pre-Funded Warrant from the Initial Subscription was , and from the Additional Subscription, in each case together with one accompanying Series A Warrant and one accompanying Series B Warrant, provided, that the Company Insiders participated in the Initial Subscription at an offering price of per Private Placement Share and accompanying Series A Warrant and Series B Warrant. The exercise price of Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants from the Initial Subscription is per share and per share in the Additional Subscription, provided that the exercise price for the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants issued to the Company Insiders is per share. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the Series A Warrants will be exercisable until May 9, 2029, which is the five-year anniversary of issuance. Subject to certain ownership limitations, the Series B Warrants will be exercisable until June 24, 2025. The Pre-Funded Warrant will not expire until exercised in full. Prior to the Amendment and Restatements (as defined below), if a holder of a Series A Warrant or a Series B Warrant was unable to exercise the warrant due to the limitation contained in the warrant that restricts the holder from owning above a specified beneficial ownership level (generally or as the result of exercise of the warrant, then the holder had the right to elect upon exercise of the warrant to receive a Pre-Funded Warrant for the same number of shares of common stock that would otherwise have been received upon exercise of the warrant. In addition, prior to the Amendment and Restatements, the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants provided for a call right starting June 24, 2025, in favor of the Company, if the volume-weighted average price of the shares of common stock exceeds specified prices.

Pre-Funded Warrants, Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants to purchase shares of its common stock in connection with the May 2024 Private Placement. The aggregate gross proceeds from the May 2024 Private Placement were approximately million, before deducting million of offering expenses. The Company reviewed the terms of the Pre-Funded Warrants, Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants under the authoritative accounting guidance as of the issuance date. As described above, the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants were initially classified as liabilities for the reason that they could have been exercised into either shares of common stock or Pre-Funded Warrants at the holder s option and thus failed the indexation guidance under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Series A Warrant and Series B Warrant liability were initially recorded at fair value as of the issuance date, and under the terms of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants when issued that liability was subject to adjustment to estimated fair value at each balance sheet date until the warrants were settled. R efer below for additional information regarding the amendment of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants that eliminated the ability of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants to be exercised into Pre-Funded Warrants, and as a result, the reclassification of the Series A and B Warrants from liability to equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Pre-Funded Warrants are equity classified because they (1) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the common stock, (2) are immediately exercisable, (3) do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (4) permit the holder to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (5) are indexed to the Company s common stock and (6) meet the equity classification criteria. T he proceeds from the May 2024 Private Placement were first allocated to the full fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants due to the initial liability classification. As disclosed in Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, the fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warra nts at issuance was million. Under authoritative guidance, if the fair value of a warrant liability exceeds the proceeds received in an arm s length transaction with no rights or privileges that require separate accounting recognition as an asset identified, then the warrant liability is recorded at fair value with the excess of fair value over proceeds recognized as a loss in earnings. The Company recognized approximately million in financing expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents the excess of the fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants at issuance over the proceeds. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a fair value gain on warrant liability of and million, respectively. Proceeds from the May 2024 Private Placement are shown as cash from financing transactions and the gain on warrant liability is included as an adjustment to reconcile the net loss to net cash used in operating activities in the statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, total offering expenses related to the May 2024 Private Placement of million were recorded as a component of other expenses as the entire proceeds were allocated to the warrant liability, which, prior to the amendment described below, could be settled with either the Company s shares of common stock or Pre-Funded Warrants, which are exercisable into the Company s shares of common stock at any time at the holders option, but not in cash payment to the holders. As of September 30, 2024, all of the Series A Warrants, and Series B Warrants issued in connection with the May 2024 Private Placement remained outstanding, and Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock remained outstanding. Amendment and Restatement of Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants On August 9, 2024, the Company amended and restated the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants (the Amendment and Restatements issued in the May 2024 Private Placement. The Amendment and Restatements eliminated the ability of the holders of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants to elect to purchase Pre-Funded Warrants upon exercise of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants in lieu of shares of common stock if the holder would have been restricted because of the specified beneficial ownership level in the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants. In addition, the Amendment and Restatements eliminated the Company s call right under the terms of the Series A Warrants to call the Series A Warrants after June 24, 2025, if the volume-weighted average price of shares of common stock exceeded specified prices. There were no other changes in the terms of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants.

million, was reclassified to equity. Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement On August 2, 2022, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the 2022 Purchase Agreement and registration rights agreement pursuant to which Lincoln Park Capital Fund Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to million of the Company s common stock. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2022 Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to million of the Company s common stock. Such sales of common stock by the Company are subject to certain limitations, and can occur from time to time, at the Company s sole discretion, over the period commencing on August 17, 2022, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. On May 16, 2022, the Company received stockholder approval for purposes of the Nasdaq listing rules to permit issuances of up to million shares of the Company s common stock (including the issuance of more than of the Company s common stock) to Lincoln Park, and it was pursuant to that approval that the Company entered into the 2022 Purchase Agreement. Upon execution of the 2022 Purchase Agreement, the Company paid million in cash as the initial commitment fee, and issued shares as the initial commitment shares, to Lincoln Park as consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at its direction under the 2022 Purchase Agreement. The Company has agreed to pay an additional commitment fee, which it may elect to pay in cash or shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, upon receipt of million aggregate gross proceeds from sales of common stock to Lincoln Park under the 2022 Purchase Agreement. On August 17, 2022, a registration statement (the First Registration Statement was declared effective to cover the resale of up to shares of the Company s common stock comprised of (i) the initial commitment shares, and (ii) up to that the Company has reserved for issuance and sale to Lincoln Park under the 2022 Purchase Agreement from time to time from and after the date of the prospectus. The Company sold shares of common stock to Lincoln Park in connection with the First Registration Statement. On August 18, 2023, a second registration statement (the Second Registration Statement was declared effective to cover the resale of up to an additional shares of the Company s common stock that the Company reserved for issuance and sale to Lincoln Park under the 2022 Purchase Agreement from time to time. The Company sold shares of common stock to Lincoln Park in connection with the Second Registration Statement. The Company cannot sell more shares than registered under the Second Registration Statement under the 2022 Purchase Agreement without registering additional shares. Actual sales of shares of common stock to Lincoln Park under the 2022 Purchase Agreement depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the common stock and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. The net proceeds under the 2022 Purchase Agreement to the Company depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells shares of its common stock to Lincoln Park. During the period from August 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the Company issued shares of common stock under the 2022 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of approximately million. The Company issued shares of common stock under the 2022 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of approximately million from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. The Company did t issue any shares of common stock under the 2022 Purchase Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock On October 31, 2023, the Company announced that its Board has approved a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ), with authorization to repurchase up to of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. The Company funded repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program with available cash.

 Overview 
 Plus Therapeutics is a U.S. pharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapeutics with advanced platform technologies for central nervous system CNS cancers. Our novel radioactive drug formulations and medical devices and therapeutic candidates are designed to deliver safe and effective doses of radiation to tumors. To achieve this, we have developed innovative approaches to drug formulation, including encapsulating radionuclides such as rhenium isotopes with nanoliposomes and microspheres. Our formulations are intended to achieve elevated patient absorbed radiation doses and extend retention times such that the clearance of the isotope occurs after significant and essentially complete radiation decay, which will contribute and provide less normal tissue/organ exposure and improved safety margins. 
 
 Traditional approaches to radiation therapy for cancer, such as external beam radiation, have many disadvantages including continuous treatment for four to six weeks (which is onerous for patients), that the radiation damages healthy cells and tissue, and that the amount of radiation delivered is very limited and, therefore, is frequently inadequate to fully destroy the cancer. 
 
 Our targeted radiotherapeutic platform and unique investigational drugs have the potential to overcome these disadvantages by directing higher, more powerful radiation doses at the tumor and only the tumor potentially in a single treatment. By minimizing radiation exposure to healthy tissues while simultaneously maximizing locoregional delivery and, thereby, efficacy, we hope to reduce the radiation toxicity for patients, improving their quality of life and life expectancy. Our radiotherapeutic platform, combined with advances in surgery, nuclear medicine, interventional radiology, and radiation oncology, affords us the opportunity to target a broad variety of cancer types. 
 
 Our lead radiotherapeutic candidate, rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda, is designed specifically for CNS cancers including recurrent glioblastoma GBM ), leptomeningeal metastases LM ), and pediatric brain cancers PBC by direct localized delivery utilizing approved standard-of-care tissue access such as with convection-enhanced delivery CED and intraventricular brain (Ommaya reservoir) catheters. Our acquired radiotherapeutic candidate, Rhenium-188 NanoLiposome Biodegradable Alginate Microsphere 188 RNL-BAM is designed to treat many solid organ cancers including primary and secondary liver cancers by intra-arterial injection. 
 
 On April 26, 2024, we acquired all of the right, title and interest in a cerebrospinal fluid cancer diagnostic portfolio CNSide from Biocept that is currently utilized in the CPRIT-funded ReSPECT-LM clinical trial. In August 2024, data from the CNSide FORESEE clinical trial in patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) was presented at the SNO/ASCO CNS Metastases Conference. The trial met is key primary and secondary endpoints and the data showed that CNSide more than doubled the diagnostic sensitivity versus gold standard cerebrospinal fluid cytology and influenced clinical management decisions in over 90 of LM cases. We are currently evaluating and developing our business plan for developing the CNSide diagnostic portfolio alongside our lead radiotherapeutic candidate, rhenium (186Re) obisbemeda, and seeking partnering opportunities for CNSide . The CNSide proprietary cell enumeration test (the CNSide Test is on track for commercial launch as soon as the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 We are headquartered in Austin, Texas, in proximity to world-class cancer institutions and researchers. Our dedicated team of engineers, physicians, scientists, and other professionals are committed to advancing our targeted radiotherapeutic technology for the benefit of 
 19 

cancer patients and healthcare providers worldwide and our current pipeline is focused on treating rare and difficult-to-treat cancers with significant unmet medical needs. 
 
 In addition to our headquarters in Austin, we have an established, good manufacturing practice validated research and development and manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas, tailored to produce Current Good Manufacturing Practice cGMP rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda. We recently expanded our manufacturing capabilities by entering into a services agreement for the radiotherapeutic development and production in a manufacturing facility in Indiana. We have built a robust supply chain through strategic partnerships that enable the development, manufacturing and future potential commercialization of our products. Our current supply chain and key partners are positioned to supply cGMP rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for ongoing and planned Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with GBM, LM and PBC. 
 
 Pipeline 
 
 Our most advanced investigational drug, rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda, is a patented radiotherapy potentially useful for patients with CNS and other cancers. Preclinical study data describing the use of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for several cancer targets have been published in peer-reviewed journals and reported at a variety of medical society peer-reviewed meetings. Besides GBM, LM and PBC, rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda has been reported to have potential applications for head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and peritoneal metastases. 
 
 The rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda technology was part of a licensed radiotherapeutic portfolio that we acquired from NanoTx, Corp. NanoTx on May 7, 2020. The licensed radiotherapeutic has been evaluated in preclinical studies for several cancer targets and we have an active 3.0 million award from U.S. National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute which is expected to provide financial support for the continued clinical development of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for recurrent GBM through the completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial, including enrollment of up to 55 patients. 
 
 On August 29, 2022, we announced feedback from a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA regarding Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls practices. The meeting focused on our cGMP clinical and commercial manufacturing process for our lead investigational targeted radiotherapeutic, BMEDA-chelated rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda, for recurrent GBM. 
 
 The FDA indicated agreement with our proposed application of cGMP guidance for radiotherapeutics, small molecule drug products and liposome drug products for our novel rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda in support of ongoing and future GBM clinical trials, manufacturing scale up, and commercialization. Alignment with the FDA includes support of our proposed controls and release strategy for new drug substance and new drug product. Because this product is identical for recurrent GBM, LM, and PBC, we believe alignment will be consistent for rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda used in other clinical development programs, including LM and PBC. 
 
 Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda versus External Beam Radiation Therapy for Recurrent GBM 
 
 Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda is a novel injectable radiotherapy designed to deliver targeted, high dose radiation directly into GBM tumors in a safe, effective, and convenient manner that may ultimately prolong patient survival. Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda is composed of the radionuclide Rhenium-186 and a nanoliposomal carrier, and is infused in a highly targeted, controlled fashion, directly into the tumor via precision brain mapping and CED catheters. Potential benefits of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda compared to standard external beam radiotherapy or external beam radiation therapy EBRT include: 
 The rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda radiation dose delivered to patients may be up to 20 times greater than what is possible with commonly used EBRT, which, unlike EBRT and proton beam devices, spares normal tissue and the brain from radiation exposure. 

Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda can be visualized in real-time during administration, possibly giving clinicians better control of radiation dosing, distribution and retention. 

Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda potentially more effectively treats a bulk tumor and microscopic disease that has already invaded healthy tissue. 

Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda is infused directly into the targeted tumor by CED catheter insertion using MRI guided software to avoid critical patient neurological structures and neural pathways and also bypasses the blood brain barrier, which delivers the therapeutic product where it is needed. Importantly, it reduces radiation exposure to healthy cells, in contrast to EBRT, which passes through normal tissue to reach the tumor, continuing its path through the tumor, hence being less targeted and selective. 

20 

Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda is given during a single, short, in-patient hospital visit, and is available in all hospitals with nuclear medicine and neurosurgery, while EBRT requires out-patient visits five days a week for approximately four to six weeks. 

ReSPECT-GBM Trial for Recurrent GBM 
 
 GBM affects approximately 15,000 patients annually in the U.S. and is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. The average life expectancy with GBM is less than 24 months, with a one-year survival rate of 40 and a five-year survival rate of around 5 . There is no clear standard of care for recurrent GBM and the few currently approved treatments provide only marginal survival benefit and are associated with significant side effects, which limit dosing and prolonged use. Approximately 90 of patients experience GBM tumor recurrence at or near the original tumor location, yet there are no FDA-approved treatments in the recurrent or progressive setting that can significantly extend a patient s life. GBM routinely presents with headaches, seizures, vision changes and other significant neurological complications, with a significant compromise in quality of life. Despite the best available medical treatments, the disease remains incurable. Even after efforts to manage the presenting signs and symptoms and completely resect the initial brain tumor, some microscopic disease almost always remains and tumor regrowth occurs within months. Complete surgical removal of GBM is usually not possible and GBM is often resistant or quickly develops resistance to most available current and investigational therapies. Even today, the treatment of GBM remains a significant challenge and it has been nearly a decade since the FDA approved a new therapy for this disease, and these more recent approvals have not improved GBM patients OS over past decades, and a significant unmet medical need persists. 
 
 For recurrent GBM, there are few currently approved treatments, which in the aggregate, provide only marginal survival benefit. Furthermore, these therapies are associated with significant side effects, which limit dosing and prolonged use. 
 
 While EBRT has been shown to be safe and has temporary efficacy in many malignancies including GBM, typically at absorbed, fractionated radiation dose of ~30 Gray in GBM, this maximum possible administered dose is always limited by toxicity to the normal tissues surrounding the malignancy and because EBRT requires fractionation to manage toxicity and maximum EBRT limits are typically reached before long-term efficacy reached. Because of this limitation, EBRT cannot provide a cure or long term control of GBM and GBM always recurs within months after EBRT. In contrast, locally delivered and targeted radiopharmaceuticals that precisely deliver radiation in the form of beta particles such as Iodine-131 for thyroid cancer, are known to be safe and effective and minimize exposure to normal cells and tissues especially with optimal administered dose and minimizing exposure to normal tissue. The locally delivered rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda is designed for and provides patient tolerability and safety. Though no rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda head-to-head trial with chemo, immune, EBRT or systemic radiopharmaceutical products have been conducted, patient tolerability and safety considerations have been reported as expected. 
 
 Interim results from our ongoing Phase 1/2a ReSPECT-GBM trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01906385) show that the beta particle energy from our lead investigational drug rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda has provided preliminary positive data and utility in treating GBM and potential other malignancies. More specifically, the preliminary data from our Phase 1/2a ReSPECT-GBM trial suggests that radiation, in the form of high energy beta particles or electrons, can be effective against GBM. Thus far, we have been able to deliver up to 740 Gy of absorbed radiation to tumor tissue in humans, without significant or dose limiting toxicities and with what we believe has the capability to go higher if required. In comparison, current EBRT protocols for recurrent GBM typically recommend a total maximum radiation dose of about ~30-35 Gray. 
 
 In September 2020, the FDA granted both Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track designations to rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for the treatment of patients with GBM. 
 
 Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda is under clinical investigation in a multicenter, sequential cohort, open-label, volume and dose escalation study of the safety, tolerability, and distribution of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda given by CED catheters to patients with recurrent or progressive malignant glioma after standard surgical, radiation, and/or chemotherapy treatment (NCT01906385). The study uses a standard, modified 3x3 Fibonacci dose escalation, followed by a planned Phase 2 expansion trial at the maximum tolerated dose MTD / maximum feasible dose MFD or non-dose limiting toxicity DLT if MTD is not reached, to determine efficacy. The trial is funded through Phase 2 in large part by a National Institute of Health/National Cancer Institute NIH/NCI grant. These investigations have not reached DLT or MTD/MFD and the study is in its eighth dosing administration cohort. Due to the observation of a preliminary efficacy signal, we have initiated in parallel a Phase 2, non-DLT dose trial pursuant to the currently funded NIH/NCI grant. This trial will begin at the current non-DLT rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda dose and will expand exploring higher radiation doses in larger volumes to treat larger tumors. Additionally, two or more rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda administrations, if indicated, will be evaluated, and reviewed with the FDA, as well as expanded safety, imaging and efficacy data to support a planned future registrational trial. 
 
 21 

On September 6, 2022, we announced a summary of our Type C clinical meeting with the FDA that focused on the ReSPECT-GBM trial. The FDA agreed with us that the ReSPECT-GBM clinical trial should proceed to the planned Phase 2. The key focus areas of clinical investigation of the Phase 2 trial will be (1) further dose exploration, including both increased dosing and multiple doses, and (2) collecting additional safety and efficacy data to inform the design of a future registrational trial. Because no DLT administered doses were observed, the FDA and we also agreed to continue to dose cohort eight. There was further agreement with the FDA that in a planned future registrational trial, overall survival should be used as the primary endpoint. We agreed with the FDA to hold future meeting(s) to consider the use of external data to augment the use of a control arm in the registrational trial. 
 
 On January 18, 2023, we announced that the first patient was dosed in the ReSPECT-GBM Phase 2b dose expansion clinical trial evaluating rhenium obisbemeda for the treatment of recurrent GBM. The Phase 2b trial is expected to enroll up to 34 total patients with small- to medium-sized tumors and is targeted for full enrollment by the end of 2024. We currently have five clinical sites, and expect an initial data read-out by the end of 2024. 
 
 In June 2023, we presented data regarding the safety and feasibility results from our Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of 186 RNL (Rhenium-186 Nanoliposome) 186 Re) Obisbemeda in Recurrent Glioma: The ReSPECT-GBM Trial at the Society of Nuclear Medicine Molecular Imaging Annual Meeting. 
 
 On November 20, 2023, we announced positive data from the ongoing ReSPECT-GBM Phase 2 trial evaluating rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda, for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma at the Society for NeuroOncology 28th Annual Meeting, which was held November 15-19, 2023 in Vancouver, Canada. Key findings included: 
 Median overall survival (mOS) in 15 patients with recurrent glioblastoma rGBM from the Phase 2 study is 13 months, which is 63 better than current standard of care (bevacizumab monotherapy) of 8 months; 9 of the 15 patients remain alive. 

Median progression free survival (mPFS) is 11 months, compared to SOC at 4 months. 

Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile, despite delivering up to 20x the dose of radiation (up to 740 Gy) typically delivered by EBRT for rGBM patients (up to 35 Gy). 

Imaging data presented by Andrew Brenner, MD, PhD is consistent with the efficacy signal of Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda in rGBM. 

On September 30, 2024, we showcased new interim ReSPECT-GBM Phase 2 Trial Data at the 2024 Congress of Neurological Surgeons Annual Meeting that included: 
 42 total patients have enrolled thus far at 3 sites and with 19/42 patients having been treated to date at the recommended Phase 2 dose (22.3 mCi in 8.8 mL) in tumors of approximately 20 cm 3 or less 

All Phase 2 patients have recurrent, histologically confirmed glioblastoma; 1 recurrence, bevacizumab na ve, single tumor of approximately 20 cm 3 or less (small-to-medium sized tumors) 

Average tumor size in Phase 2 was 7.5 mL (range 0.9-22.8 mL) 

Increases in absorbed dose correlated with specific drug delivery parameters such as infused dose and volume, maximal convection flow rate, and number of catheters 

Rhenium 186 Re) Obisbemeda continues to show a favorable safety profile in the 42 enrolled patients; one dose-limiting toxicity (hemiplegia) has been reported, which was observed in Cohort 8 (41.5 mCi and 16.3 mL) 

In Phase 2, most adverse events (AEs) were mild (73.5 or moderate (18.8 ), and largely unrelated (37.7 ), or unlikely related (27.1 to the drug. Of the 9 severe adverse events (SAEs), only 2 were related to the study drug 

Average absorbed radiation dose to the tumor in Phase 2 was 300 Gy (n=18, 1 patient still under analysis) 

To date, 88.9 of Phase 2 patients met key CED drug delivery parameters shown to correlate with overall survival, achieving a tumor absorbed dose >100 Gy and radiation coverage of >70 

29/42 patients treated thus far participated in the Phase 1 dose escalation phase of the trial (Note: as per protocol, 6/42 patients were included in both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trial arms and related analyses) 

Phase 1 dose-escalation increased administered doses from 1.0 mCi to 41.5 mCi and volumes from 0.66 mL to 16.3 mL 

22 

In terms of objective tumor response based on quantitative image analysis, a statistically significant reduction in tumor volume rate change was seen in tumors receiving > 100 Gy absorbed dose (n=11 patients analyzed to date, p 
 We anticipate completing our Phase 1 ReSPECT-GBM Trial for large sized tumors in mid-2025 and completing our Phase 2 ReSPECT-Recurrent GBM Trial in mid-2025 as well. 
 
 ReSPECT-LM Clinical Trials for LM 
 
 LM is a rare complication of cancer in which the disease spreads to the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The incidence of LM is growing and occurs in approximately 5 , or more, of people with late-stage cancer, or 110,000 people in the U.S. each year. It is highly lethal with an average one-year survival of just 7 . All solid cancers, particularly breast, lung, GI, and melanoma, have the potential to spread to the leptomeninges. 
 
 The ReSPECT-LM Phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05034497) was preceded with preclinical studies in which tolerance to doses of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda as high as 1,075 Gy were shown in animal models with LM without significant observed toxicity. Furthermore, treatment led to a marked reduction in tumor burden in both C6 and MDA-231 LM models. 
 
 Upon receiving acceptance of our Investigational New Drug application and Fast Track designation by the FDA for rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for the treatment of LM in November 2021, we initiated the trial and began screening patients for the ReSPECT-LM Phase 1 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 
 ReSPECT-LM is a multi-center, sequential cohort, open-label, dose escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a single-dose application of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda administered through intrathecal infusion to the ventricle of patients with LM after standard surgical, radiation, and/or chemotherapy treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence and severity of adverse events and dose limiting toxicities, together with determining the maximum tolerated and recommended Phase 2 dose. Full enrollment in the Phase 1 trial is expected by the end of 2024, with the plan to add additional clinical sites to support the trial. 
 
 On September 19, 2022, we entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract (the CPRIT Contract ), effective as of August 31, 2022, with Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas CPRIT ), pursuant to which CPRIT will provide us a grant of up to 17.6 million (the CPRIT Grant over a three-year period to fund the continued development of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for the treatment of patients with LM through Phase 2 of the ReSPECT LM clinical trial. The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions, including, but not limited to, a matching fund requirement (one dollar from us for every two dollars awarded by CPRIT), revenue sharing obligations upon commercialization of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda based on specific dollar thresholds until CPRIT receives the aggregate amount of 400 of the proceeds awarded under the CPRIT Grant, and certain reporting requirements. To date, we have received approximately 10.7 million in milestone payments under the CPRIT Contract. 
 
 Interim results showed that a single treatment with rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda resulted in a consistent decreased cerebrospinal fluid CSF tumor cell count/ml and was tolerated by all LM patients. Rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda is an outpatient administration and treatment and is easily and safely administered through a standard intraventricular catheter (Ommaya Reservoir), distributed promptly throughout the CSF, and with durable retention in the leptomeninges at least through day seven. All patients have shown well tolerated prompt and durable rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda distribution throughout the subarachnoid space. On March 11, 2024, we announced we had completed Cohort 5 of the ReSPECT-LM Phase 1/2a dose escalation trial. 
 
 A total of 26 patients have received a single-dose of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda in the ReSPECT-LM trial as of October 9, 2024. There have been no dose limiting toxicities observed to date with administered radiation doses up to 66.14 millicuries in Cohort 5, a ten-fold increase over Cohort 1. In addition, five new clinical trial sites were added to this trial over the last year, bringing the total number of sites to seven. 
 
 On August 10, 2023, we presented data from the ReSPECT-LM clinical trial of rhenium 186 Re) obismeda at the Society for Neuro Oncology ASCO CNS Cancer Conference. 
 
 In November 2023, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for the treatment of patients with breast cancer with LM. 
 
 On December 12, 2023, we announced our partnership with K2bio to implement novel analysis for CSF tumor and molecular biomarkers for CNS cancers. Initial clinical specimen processing and testing began in the first quarter 2024 in our ongoing Phase 1 ReSPECT-LM trial of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda in patients with LM. 
 
 23 

In mid-June 2024, we presented updated data from our Phase 1 ReSPECT-LM trial at the annual meeting of Society of Nuclear Medicine Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) conference. 
 
 From August 8-10, 2024, we presented data at the 2024 Society for NeuroOncology (SNO)/American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) CNS Metastases Conference. The presentation, titled, Phase 1 Dose Escalation of Rhenium 186 Re) Obisbemeda (Rhenium Nanoliposome, 186 RNL) for the Treatment of Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM): Ongoing Clinical Study Update for Initial Safety and Feasibility, provided a safety and efficacy update on the single dose trial for the first 4 cohorts (n = 16 patients). The trial is currently enrolling in Cohort 5. The study was presented by Andrew Brenner, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Kolitz/Zachry Endowed Chair Neuro-Oncology Research; Co-Leader, Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics Program, University of Texas Health, San Antonio. 
 
 We anticipate completing the Phase 1 single administration ReSPECT-LM trial this year and intend to present data at the Society for Neuro-Oncology conference in November 2024. We also anticipate beginning enrollment for a ReSPECT-LM Multi-Dose trial in the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 ReSPECT-PBC Clinical Trial for Pediatric Brain Cancer 
 
 The average annual age adjusted mortality rate for children aged 0-14 for malignant brain (and other CNS) tumors is 0.71/100,000, making it the most common cause of death and cancer death in this age group. The 2021 World Health Organization Classification of CNS Tumors classifies gliomas, glioneuronal tumors, and neuronal tumors into six different families: (1) adult-type diffuse gliomas; (2) pediatric-type diffuse low-grade gliomas; (3) pediatric-type diffuse high-grade gliomas HGG (4) circumscribed astrocytic gliomas; (5) glioneuronal and neuronal tumors; and (6) ependymomas. 
 
 In August 2021, we announced plans for treating pediatric brain cancer at the 2021 American Association of Neurological Surgeons Annual Scientific Meeting. In July 2021, we reported that we had received FDA feedback pertaining to a pre-IND meeting briefing package in which the FDA stated that we are not required to perform any additional preclinical or toxicology studies. 
 
 Given the initial FDA feedback, receipt of adult GBM data and experience with rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda and follow-up communications with the FDA, we plan to submit a pediatric brain tumor IND for our ReSPECT-PBC clinical trial to investigate the use of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda in two pediatric brain cancers, high-grade glioma and ependymoma, in the of fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Pediatric high-grade gliomas can be found almost anywhere within the CNS; however, they are most commonly found within the supratentorium. The highest incidence of supratentorial, high-grade gliomas in pediatrics appears to occur in children aged 15 to 19 years, with a median age of approximately nine years. Overall, pediatric high-grade glioma confers a three-year progression free survival PFS of 11 3 and three-year OS of 22 5 . One-year PFS is as low as 40 in recent trials. Ependymomas are slow-growing central nervous system tumors that involve the ventricular system. Diagnosis is based on MRI and biopsy and survival rate depends on tumor grade and how much of the tumor can be removed. Grade II pathology was associated with significantly improved OS compared to Grade III (anaplastic) pathology (five-year OS = 71 5 vs. 57 10 ; p = 0.026). Gross total resection compared to subtotal resection was associated with significantly improved OS (five-year OS = 75 5 vs. 54 8 ; p = 0.002). 
 
 Overall, pediatric HGG and ependymoma are extremely difficult-to-treat pediatric brain tumors, frequently aggressive, and in recurrent settings, carry an extremely poor prognosis. 
 
 Effective September 1, 2024, we entered into an agreement with the Department of Defense DoD office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs to receive a 3.0 million fund for research and development purposes DoD Award over a three-year period. The DoD Award will be used to support the planned expansion of our clinical trial for pediatric brain cancer. We anticipate beginning enrollment for our Phase 1 ReSPECT-PBC clinical trial in the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 Rhenium-188 NanoLiposome Biodegradable Alginate Microsphere Technology 
 
 In January 2022, we announced that we licensed Biodegradable Alginate Microsphere BAM patents and technology from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio UTHSCSA to expand our tumor targeting capabilities and precision radiotherapeutics pipeline. We intend to combine our Rhenium NanoLiposome technology with the BAM technology to create a novel radioembolization technology. Initially, we intend to utilize the Rhenium-188 isotope, 188 RNL-BAM for the intra-arterial embolization and local delivery of a high dose of targeted radiation for a variety of solid organ cancers such as hepatocellular cancer, hepatic metastases, pancreatic cancer and many others. 
 
 Preclinical data from an ex vivo embolization experiment in which Technetium99m-BAM was intra-arterially delivered to a bovine kidney perfusion model was presented at Society of Interventional Radiology Annual Scientific Meeting. The study concluded that the technology required for radiolabeling BAM could successfully deliver, embolize and retain radiation in the target organ. 188 RNL-BAM 
 24 

is a preclinical investigational device we intend to further develop and move into clinical trials. Specifically, in 2022 we transferred the 188 RNL-BAM technology from UTHSCSA, and began planning to develop the product and complete early preclinical studies to support a future FDA IND submission. Our intended initial clinical target is liver cancer which is the sixth most common and third deadliest cancer worldwide. It is a rare disease with increasing U.S. annual incidence (42,000) and deaths (30,000). 
 
 On July 26, 2023, the FDA responded to a Pre-IND submission that the 188 RNL-BAM product under development would likely be subject to regulation as a medical device under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA ), rather than as a drug product.

Research and development expenses increased by approximately 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase of 0.2 million in compensation expenses, an increase of approximately 0.6 million of professional research and development service fees, and an increase of 0.2 million in depreciation and other expenses, offset by a reduction of 0.6 million in clinical expenses. 
 
 Research and development expenses increased by approximately 1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase of 1.1 million increases in professional services, an increase of 0.5 million in compensation expenses, an increase of 0.2 million for depreciation and legal expenses, offset by a reduction of 0.4 million in clinical expenses. 
 
 We expect aggregate research and development expenses to increase during the remainder of 2024 as compared to the corresponding comparable period ended December 31, 2023 as we continue to advance and expand our research programs. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include costs for administrative personnel, legal and other professional expenses, and general corporate expenses.

The decrease in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to the repayment of debt principal of 1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and 4.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by interest expenses on our line of credit facility. Interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a lower average cash and investment balances in year to date 2024 offset by a higher interest rate environment and accreted income on our available-for-sale securities. 
 
 We recognized approximately 3.5 million in financing expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which represents the excess of the fair value of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants at issuance over the proceeds. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net fair value gain on warrant liability of 1.0 million and 5.7 million, respectively. The Series A and Series B Warrants were amended during the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting the warrants being reclassified from liability to equity of the balance sheet, and no longer required to be recorded at fair value at each period end with change in the fair value recorded in the statement of operations. 
 
 In addition, total offering expenses related to the May 2024 Private Placement of 0.4 million were recorded as a component of other expenses as the entire proceeds were allocated to the warrant liability, which could have been be settled with either the Company s common stock or Pre-Funded Warrants, that are exercisable into shares of common stock at any time at the holders option, but not in cash payment to the holders. 
 We expect interest expense in 2024 to increase as compared with 2023 due to an expected higher principal balance subject to interest.

We incurred net losses of 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We have an accumulated deficit of 489.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we used net cash of 9.3 million to fund our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 May 2024 Private Placement 
 
 In May 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, which was subsequently amended, with certain investors, including certain of the Company s directors and executive officers (the Purchasers ), whereby we issued and sold in a private placement (the May 2024 Private Placement ): (i) 3,591,532 shares of common stock Private Placement Share ), or, at the election of each Purchaser, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants exercisable immediately to purchase shares of common stock. Each Private Placement Share or Pre-Funded Warrant are accompanied by (i) a Series A common warrant Series A Warrants to purchase one share of common stock, for an aggregate of 3,591,532 Series A Warrants, and (ii) one Series B common warrant Series B Warrants , and together with the Pre-Funded Warrants and Series A Warrants, the Warrants to purchase one share of common stock, for an aggregate of 3,591,532 Series B Warrants. At the closing of the May 2024 Private Placement, we received aggregate up-front gross proceeds of approximately 7.3 million, before deducting fees and other expenses associated with the closing of the May 2024 Private Placement. If the Warrants are exercised in full we will receive additional gross proceeds of approximately 12.0 million. None of the Series A and Series B Warrants issued in connection with the May 2024 Private Placement have been exercised as of the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. See Note 12, Stockholders Deficit - May 2024 Private Placement, of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 CPRIT Grant 
 
 On September 19, 2022, we entered into the CPRIT Contract, pursuant to which CPRIT will provide us with the CPRIT Grant of 17.6 million subject to the terms of the CPRIT Contract, to fund approximately two-thirds of the continued development of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for the treatment of patients with LM. We received 10.4 million of the available funding under the CPRIT Grant during 2022, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of which we recognized 4.4 million, 4.9 million and 0.2 million of grant revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amounts recognized represents CPRIT s share of the costs incurred for our rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda development for the treatment of patients with LM. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.8 million of deferred revenue related to the CPRIT Grant. 
 
 DoD Award 
 
 Effective September 1, 2024, we entered into an agreement with the DoD office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) to receive a 3.0 million fund for research and development purposes over a three year period. The DoD Award will be used to support the planned expansion of our clinical trial for pediatric brain cancer. On October 4, 2024, we received the first payment under the DoD Award in the amount of 0.9 million. 
 
 Private Equity Lines 
 
 On August 2, 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement (the 2022 Purchase Agreement and registration rights agreement pursuant to which Lincoln Park Capital Fund Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to 50.0 million of shares of our common stock. Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the 2022 Purchase Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to 50.0 million of shares of our common stock, provided that we cannot sell more than 57.5 million shares pursuant to the 2022 Purchase Agreement. Sales of common stock by us are subject to certain limitations, and can occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 36-month period commencing on August 17, 2022, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Actual sales of shares of common stock to Lincoln Park under the 2022 Purchase Agreement depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of the common stock and our determinations as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. As consideration for Lincoln Park s irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of our common stock upon the terms of and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the 2022 Purchase Agreement, we paid 0.1 million in cash as an Initial Commitment Fee and issued 32,846 as the initial commitment 
 28

 During the period from August 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022, we issued 266,666 shares under the 2022 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of approximately 3.2 million. We issued 410,500 shares under the 2022 Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of approximately 1.0 million from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. No shares of common stock were purchased under the 2022 Purchase Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 On January 14, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the January 2022 Distribution Agreement with Canaccord, pursuant to which we could issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock in at-the-market offerings, having an aggregate offering price of up to 5 million, depending on market demand, with Canaccord acting as an agent for sales. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued 460,151 shares under the January 2022 Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately 4.8 million. The January 2022 Distribution Agreement was terminated after all available registered shares were fully utilized. 
 
 Nasdaq Listing Compliance 
 
 On March 8, 2024, we received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq ), notifying us that we no longer complied with the requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) to maintain a minimum of 2.5 million in stockholders equity (the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market or the alternative requirements of having a market value of listed securities of 35 million or net income from continuing operations of 500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years (the Alternative Standards ). 
 On September 5, 2024, Nasdaq notified us that we had not regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and that, as a result, unless we timely requested an appeal of this determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), Nasdaq would move to suspend trading of our common stock and to have our shares of common stock delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. We timely requested a hearing before the Panel, and the hearing was held on October 22, 2024. 
 On October 30, 2024, we received a decision from the Panel, notifying us that we had until March 4, 2025, to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. The Panel also required that we file a public disclosure on or before March 4, 2025 and describe the transactions undertaken by us to achieve compliance and demonstrate long-term compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. The Panel also noted that it is a requirement during the exception period that we provide prompt notification to the Panel of any significant events that occur during this time that may affect the our compliance with Nasdaq s requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, any event that may call into question the our ability to meet the terms of the exception granted. The Panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of its decision based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the our securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market inadvisable or unwarranted. 
 
 Funding and Material Cash Requirements 
 
 To date, our operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital from issuance of shares of our common and preferred stocks, proceeds from the now-repaid in full term loan with Oxford Finance, LLC Oxford ), the Pershing Credit Facility and grant funding. However, the Company has had, and will continue to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license or development agreements to fund our future clinical development programs and other operations in the next twelve months from the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or 
 29 

restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise additional capital in the future. Our inability to raise additional cash would have a material adverse impact on our operations, implementation of our strategy and ability to maintain compliance with 
 applicable requirements, including Nasdaq listing rules. 
 
 Our present and future funding and cash requirements will depend on many factors, including, among other things: 
 
 the progress, timing and completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and nonclinical studies; 

our ability to receive, and the timing of receipt of, future regulatory approvals for our product candidates and the costs related thereto; 

the development and utility of the CNSide Test; 

the scope, progress, results and costs of our ongoing and planned operations; 

the costs associated with expanding our operations and building our sales and marketing capabilities; 

our ability to establish strategic collaborations; 

the cost and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; 

the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved; and 

potential new product candidates that the Company identifies and attempt to develop. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Cash (used in) provided by operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is summarized as follows (in thousands):

Material Cash Obligations 
 Under the CPRIT Contract we receive matching funds for approximately two-thirds of the development costs for the development of rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda for the treatment of patients with LM, subject to various funding conditions. The CPRIT Contract is effective for three years, unless otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the contract. CPRIT may require us to repay some or all of the disbursed CPRIT grant proceeds (with interest not to exceed 5 annually) in the event of the early termination of the CPRIT Contract. 
 
 Under our Pershing Credit Facility, we have ongoing principal and interest payment obligations (see Note 6, Line of Credit Facility, of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details). In addition, we are obligated to make operating lease payments for our office and laboratory space, and we may be required to make payments under certain of our other contractual agreements. 
 
 Other than as described above, we have no purchase commitments or long-term contractual obligations, except for lease obligations as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC) that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.3 million compared to 11.0 million in the same period of 2023. Our operational cash use decreased 1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, due primarily to increased reimbursement under the CPRIT grant agreement for research and development costs related to the ReSPECT-LM program. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to purchase of Biocept assets of 0.5 million, purchase of short-term investments of 7.1 million. redemption of short-term investments of 3.7 million, and purchases of fixed assets of 0.1 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to purchases of fixed assets of 0.1 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to net proceeds of 7.3 million raised by the May 2024 Private Placement, and drawdown of 3.3 million from the Pershing Credit Facility, offset by repurchase of treasury stock for approximately 0.4 million and repayment of principle balance under the Oxford loan of 4.0 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to the net proceeds from sales of shares of common stock of 5.2 million through the September 2022 Distribution Agreement with Canaccord and the 2022 Purchase Agreement, offset by 1.2 million of principal repayment under our Term Loan. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 While our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made, our actual results may differ from our estimates, perhaps significantly. If results differ materially from our estimates, we will make adjustments to our consolidated financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment. 
 Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We perform our impairment test annually during the fourth quarter. We operate in a single operating segment and reporting unit. We monitor the fluctuations in our share price and have experienced significant volatility during the year. 
 We believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 except as described below. 
 Warrant Liability 
 Accounting for liability classified warrants requires management to exercise judgment and make estimates and assumptions regarding their fair value (for more information about the material inputs and assumptions used to value the liability classified warrants refer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, of our condensed consolidated financial statements). The warrant liabilities are initially recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, with changes recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the liability classified warrants will continue to be recognized until the warrants are exercised, expire or qualify for equity classification. 
 In May 2024, the Company issued the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants and classified them as liabilities because in certain circumstances they could have been exercised into either shares of common stock or Pre-Funded Warrants at the holder s option and thus failed the indexation guidance under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. On August 9 , 2024, the Company amended and restated the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants (the Amendment and Restatements to eliminate the ability of the holder to elect to receive Pre-Funded Warrants in this situation. 
 As a result of the Amendment and Restatements, the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, as amended, no longer fail the indexation guidance under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and the balance of the warrant liability at the amendment date, in the amount of 5.2 million, was reclassified to equity. As a result, as of the amendment date, there was a corresponding increase in our condensed statements of stockholders equity.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or furnish pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings 
 None. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 
 We have been notified by Nasdaq of our failure to comply with the minimum stockholders equity continued listing requirement and, if we are unable to regain compliance with it or other applicable continued listing requirements and standards of Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted from Nasdaq. 
 
 Shares of our common stocks are currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy continued listing requirements and standards. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the applicable listing standards of Nasdaq. 
 
 As previously disclosed, on March 8, 2024, we received the Notice from the Listing Qualifications staff of Nasdaq, notifying us that we no longer complied with the requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) to maintain the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market or the Alternative Standards. 
 
 On September 5, 2024, Nasdaq notified us that we had not regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and that, as a result, unless we timely requested an appeal of this determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), Nasdaq would move to suspend trading of our common stock and to have our shares of common stock delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. We timely requested a hearing before the Panel, and the hearing was held on October 22, 2024. 
 
 On October 30, 2024, we received a decision from the Panel, notifying us that we had until March 4, 2025, to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. The Panel also required that us to file a public disclosure on or before March 4, 2025 and describe the transactions undertaken by us to achieve compliance and demonstrate long-term compliance with the Minimum 
 32 

Stockholders Equity Requirement. The Panel also noted that it is a requirement during the exception period that we provide prompt notification to the Panel of any significant events that occur during this time that may affect our compliance with Nasdaq s requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, any event that may call into question our ability to meet the terms of the exception granted. The Panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of its decision based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the Company s securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market inadvisable or unwarranted. 
 In the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, as a result of our failure to comply with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement, or as a result of our failure to continue to comply with any other requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq, we may have to pursue trading on a less recognized or accepted market, such as the over the counter markets, our stock may be traded as a penny stock, which would make transactions in our common stock more difficult and cumbersome, and we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all, as companies trading on alternative markets may be viewed as less attractive investments with higher associated risks, such that existing or prospective institutional investors may be less interested in, or prohibited from, investing in our common stock. This may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
 
 We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities without our stockholder approval, and holders of warrants and other securities convertible into shares of our common stock may choose to exercise their warrants and other securities requiring us to issue shares of common stock; all of these actions would dilute your ownership interest and may depress the market price of our common stock. 
 
 In May 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors, including certain of our directors and executive officers, and issued and sold in a private placement: (i) an aggregate of 3,591,532 shares of common stock (or in lieu of shares of common stock, Pre-Funded Warrants), and (ii) Warrants to purchase up to 7,183,064 shares of common stock. If these Warrants are exercised, it will result in significant dilution to our stockholders. See Note 12 (Stockholders Deficit - May 2024 Private Placement) for further details regarding the May 2024 Private Placement and the terms of the Warrants. 
 
 In addition to the Warrants, we will seek additional sources of financing to continue the clinical development of our product candidates. Outstanding securities convertible into our shares of common stock may also be exercised and restricted stock units may vest resulting in the issuance of additional shares of common stock, which will result in further dilution to our stockholders. 
 
 Significant additional capital will needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including further development of our product candidates, preparing IND or equivalent filings, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our shares of common stock. 
 
 We may also issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances. The issuance of additional shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects: 
 existing stockholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease; 

the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common stock may be diminished; and 

the market price of the common stock may decline. 

We recently acquired the CNSide diagnostic portfolio, and we may not be successful in our efforts to develop, fully utilize and monetize it. 
 
 In April 2024, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the right, title and interest in CNSide , including the CNSide Test , which is designed to detect, quantify, and monitor tumor status in LM. We are currently evaluating and developing our business plan for developing the CNSide diagnostic portfolio alongside our lead radio therapeutic candidate, rhenium 186 Re) obisbemeda, and seeking partnering opportunities for CNSide but there can be no assurances that we will be able to develop the technology to allow for commercial applications, or successfully utilize and fully integrate CNSide into our operations. We may not generate revenues from or realize the anticipated benefits of CNSide within our expected timeline or at all. 
 
 188 RNL-BAM will be regulated as a medical device, which may result in additional regulatory and other risks. 
 
 33 

188 RNL-BAM was developed and tested preclinically as a drug product. The FDA has informed us that 188 RNL-BAM will, moving forward, be regulated instead as a medical device. 
 
 In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, or approval of premarket approval PMA ), from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the process of obtaining premarket clearance or approval following either of these routes, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is either substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device with similar intended uses and the same technological characteristics and risks, or that it is safe and effective for its intended use, based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life supporting or implantable devices. 
 
 Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA generally require FDA approval of the modifications through a supplemental application. Both the PMA approval and the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, lengthy and uncertain. The process of obtaining a PMA is costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical studies. Despite the time, effort and cost, a medical device may not be approved by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory approvals, they may include significant limitations on the approved and labeled indications for use for the device, which may limit the market for the device. 
 
 In addition, comparable foreign regulatory authorities to the FDA have approval policies and regulations related to the safety and performance requirements that apply to 188 RNL-BAM, either as medical devices or as drugs, depending on each jurisdiction s regulatory requirements. Accordingly, to the extent that we intend to sell medical devices in member states of the European Union or other foreign jurisdictions, the regulatory approval pathway for our product candidates, including 188 RNL-BAM, may be uncertain, complex, expensive and lengthy, and approval may not be obtained. 
 
 Failure to successfully develop or supply the 188 RNL-BAM medical device component, delays in or failure of the studies conducted by us, our collaborators, or third-party providers, or failure of our management, our collaborators, or third-party providers to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of 188 RNL-BAM as a medical device or drug, as applicable in each jurisdiction, could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval, and associated delays in 188 RNL-BAM reaching the market. Further, failure to successfully develop or supply the device, or to gain or maintain its approval, could adversely affect our operations. 
 
 Other than the risk factors set forth above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 I te m 5. Other Inform ation 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, ne of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
