abrdn Platinum ETF Trust 

Notes to the Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Shares (also referred to as Baskets in exchange for deposits of platinum and distributes platinum in connection with the redemption of Baskets. Shares
represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor
is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of abrdn Inc., which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary
of abrdn plc. The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement. 

The investment objective of the Trust is
for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical platinum, less
the Trust s expenses. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a
 Shareholder an opportunity to participate in the platinum market through an investment in securities. The fiscal
year end for the Trust is December 31. 

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance
with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial
information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q. In the opinion of the Trust's management, all adjustments (which consist of
normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations as of and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and for all periods presented have been made. 

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the Trust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. 

Effective May 23, 2024, the
Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor, entered into an Allocated Account Agreement and Unallocated Account Agreement with ICBC
Standard Bank Plc ICBC ), providing for the custody of the Trust's platinum. Effective August 8, 2024, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. no longer serves as a custodian of the Trust s platinum. At September 30, 2024, all of the Trust s platinum was held at ICBC. 

The Trust's platinum is recorded at fair value. The cost of
platinum is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the afternoon session of the twice daily
fix of an ounce of platinum administered by the London Metal Exchange LME ). Realized gains and losses on transfers
of platinum, or platinum distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between
the fair value and average cost of platinum transferred. 

The LME is responsible for the administration of the electronic
platinum price fixing system LMEbullion that replicates electronically the manual London platinum fix processes
previously employed by the London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Ltd LPPFCL ), as well as providing electronic
market clearing processes for platinum bullion transactions at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. LMEbullion,
like the previous London platinum fix processes, establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of platinum twice each
London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 9:45 a.m. London time (the LBMA Platinum Price AM and 2:00
p.m. London time (the LBMA Platinum Price PM ). 

Once the value of platinum has been determined, the
net asset value (the NAV is computed by the Trustee by deducting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities
of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsor s Fee ), from the fair value of the platinum
and all other assets held by the Trust. 

The Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment
in platinum as changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment in platinum through the Statement of Operations. 

The per Share amount of platinum exchanged for a purchase
or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee using the LME PM Fix to calculate the platinum amount in respect of any liabilities
for which covering platinum sales have not yet been made, and represents the per Share amount of platinum held by the
Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are as follows: 

Level 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 

Level 2. Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data. 

Level 3. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based on the best information available. 

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that
are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree
of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3. 

The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different
levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which
the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement in its entirety. 

The Trust s investment in platinum is classified
as a level 1 asset, as its value is calculated using unadjusted quoted prices from primary market sources. 

There
were no transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. 

platinum receivable or payable for the creation or
redemption of Shares. At December 31, 2023, the Trust had platinum receivable or payable for the creation or
redemption of Shares. 

Shares). The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to Authorized
Participants on an ongoing basis. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust.
An Authorized Participant is a person who (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank
or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions; (2) is
a participant in The Depository Trust Company; (3) has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trustee and the
Sponsor; and (4) has established an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account with the Trust s Custodian or other platinum
bullion clearing bank. An Authorized Participant Agreement is an agreement entered into by each Authorized Participant, the Sponsor
and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the platinum required
for such creations and redemptions. An Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is an unallocated platinum account established with the Custodian or a platinum bullion clearing bank by an Authorized Participant. 

The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange
for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of platinum represented by the Baskets being
created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created
or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 

Authorized Participants may, on any business day, place an order
with the Trustee to create or redeem one or more Baskets. Effective May 28, 2024, the settlement standard period for Shares is
one business day. Prior to May 28, 2024, the settlement period for Shares was two business days. In the event of a trade date at
period end, where a settlement is pending, a respective account receivable and/or payable will be recorded. When platinum
is exchanged in settlement of a redemption, it is considered a sale of platinum for financial statement purposes. 

The amount of platinum represented by the Baskets created
or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000th of an ounce. As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption
of Shares may differ from the value of platinum to be delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that
the correct amount of platinum is available at all times to back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its Sponsor
Fee in the event of any shortfall or excess on each transaction. For each transaction, this amount is not more than 1/1000th
of an ounce of platinum. 

As the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the
option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the outstanding Shares as Net Assets. Changes in the number of Shares
outstanding are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

The Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing
expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly fee and out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee
and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to per annum in legal expenses.

At September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, the fees
payable to the Sponsor were and , respectively. 

With respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor,
the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust's platinum as necessary to pay these
expenses. When selling platinum to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell the smallest amounts of platinum needed to pay
these expenses in order to minimize the Trust's holdings of assets other than platinum. Other than the Sponsor's Fee, the Trust
had expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling platinum,
the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the LBMA Platinum Price PM. The Trustee will place orders with dealers
(which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the most favorable price and execution of orders.
The Custodian may be the purchaser of such platinum only if the sale transaction is made at the next LBMA Platinum Price PM or
such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set following the sale order. A gain or loss is
recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average cost of the platinum sold. Neither the Trustee nor
the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized gains and losses result from the transfer of platinum
for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value
and average cost of platinum transferred.

Introduction 

The Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the
state of New York on December 30, 2009. The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does
not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is
not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act.
It does not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool, or subject to regulation as a commodity pool
operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing Shares. 

The Trust holds platinum and is expected to issue Baskets
in exchange for deposits of platinum and to distribute platinum in connection with redemptions of Baskets. Shares issued
by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The investment objective of the Trust
is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical platinum, less the Trust s expenses. The
Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost effective investment relative to traditional means
of investing in platinum. 

The Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants
in exchange for platinum and only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares or integral multiples thereof. A list of current
Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. 

Shares of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the
 NYSE Arca under the symbol PPLT . 

Valuation of Platinum
and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading,
as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. New York time on such day (the Evaluation Time ), the Trustee evaluates
the platinum held by the Trust and determines the NAV of the Trust. 

At the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the
Trust s platinum on the basis of that day s LBMA Platinum Price PM or, if no LBMA Platinum Price PM is made on such
day, that day s LBMA Platinum Price AM will be used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a
basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the LBMA Platinum Price PM, the LBMA Platinum Price AM or such other
publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust s platinum is not an
appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s platinum, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be
employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the LBMA
Platinum Price PM, the LBMA Platinum Price AM or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation
of the Trust s platinum or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination
is made in good faith. 

Once the value of the platinum has been determined, the
Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes
place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from
the total value of the platinum and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust s reserve
account, if established). The resulting figure is the adjusted net asset value (the ANAV of the Trust. The ANAV
of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor s Fee. 

13 

All fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place
that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets are calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day. The
Trustee subtracts from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the
Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as
of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 

Any estimate of the accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities
of the Trust for purposes of computing the NAV of the Trust and ANAV made by the Trustee in good faith shall be conclusive upon
all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required
by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those actually paid. 

The NAV of the Trust is obtained by subtracting
the Trust s liabilities on any day from the value of the platinum owned and receivable by the Trust on that day; the NAV
per Share is obtained by dividing the NAV of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding on that day. 

The Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 

The Trust's NAV decreased from 1,029,587,672
at June 30, 2024 to 1,000,603,638 at September 30, 2024, a 2.82 decrease for the quarter. The change in the Trust's NAV resulted from a decrease in the price per ounce of platinum, which fell 2.67 from 1,012.00 at June 30, 2024 to 985.00 at September
30, 2024. There was no change in outstanding Shares, which stayed the same from 11,100,000 Shares at June 30, 2024 to 11,100,000
Shares at September 30, 2024, as a result of 400,000 Shares (8 Baskets) being created and 400,000 Shares (8 Baskets) being redeemed
during the quarter. 

The NAV per Share decreased 2.82 from 92.76
at June 30, 2024 to 90.14 at September 30, 2024. The Trust's NAV per Share fell slightly more than the price per ounce of platinum
on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor's Fee, which was 1,485,499 for the quarter, or 0.60 of the Trust's ANAV on an annualized
basis. 

The NAV per Share of 93.76 at July 5, 2024
was the highest during the period, compared with a low of 83.32 at September 4, 2024. 

The decrease in net assets from operations for
the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 28,421,262, resulting from a realized gain of 15,497 on the transfer of platinum to
pay expenses, a realized gain of 261,673 on platinum distributed for the redemption of Shares, offset by a change in unrealized
loss on investment in platinum of 27,212,933, and the Sponsor's Fee of 1,485,499. Other than the Sponsor's Fee, the Trust had
no expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 

The Trust's NAV increased from 997,445,666
at December 31, 2023 to 1,000,603,638 at September 30, 2024, a 0.32 increase for the period. The change in the Trust's NAV resulted from a decrease in the price per ounce of platinum,which fell 1.50 from 1,000.00 at December 31, 2023 to 985.00 at September 30, 2024 and
an increase in outstanding Shares, which increased from 10,850,000 Shares at December 31, 2023 to 11,100,000 Shares at September 30,2024,
as a result of 1,450,000 Shares (29 Baskets) being created and 1,200,000 Shares (24 Baskets) being redeemed. 

The NAV per Share decreased 1.95 
from 91.93 at December 31, 2023 to 90.14 at September 30, 2024. The Trust's NAV per Share fell slightly more than the price per
ounce of platinum on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor's Fee, which was 4,397,789 for
the period, or 0.60 of the Trust's ANAV on an annualized basis. 

The NAV per Share of 97.68 at May 17, 2024
was the highest during the period, compared with a low of 80.08 at March 1, 2024. 

14 

The decrease in net assets from
operations for the period ended September 30, 2024 was 14,345,853, resulting from a realized loss of 29,864 on the transfer of
platinum to pay expenses and a realized loss of 84,783 on platinum distributed for the redemption of Shares, a change in unrealized
loss on investment in platinum of 9,833,417, and the Sponsor's Fee of 4,397,789 . Other than
the Sponsor's Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the period ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity 
Capital Resources 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments,
events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s
Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the
Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s Fee. 

The Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its
own discretion, sell the Trust s platinum as necessary to pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed
by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell platinum to pay the Sponsor s Fee but will pay the Sponsor s Fee through
in-kind transfers of platinum to the Sponsor. At September 30, 2024, the Trust did not have any cash balances. 

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements 

The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting
Policies 

The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These
estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies. Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements
for further information on accounting policies. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures 

The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure

controls and procedures were effective.

internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are
