As the Company had the intent and ability to hold the remaining available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, each security with an unrealized loss position in the above tables has been further assessed to determine if a credit loss exists. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not expect any credit losses in its available-for-sale debt securities and credit losses were recognized on available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s investment securities were comprised primarily of debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, with under of the investment securities comprised of collateralized loan obligations rated AA or better and obligations issued by local state and political subdivisions rated AA or better. For investment securities issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, management has concluded that the long history with no credit losses from these issuers indicates an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, and these securities are explicitly or implicitly fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. The U.S. government can print its own currency and its currency is routinely held by central banks and other major financial institutions. The dollar is used in international commerce, and commonly is viewed as a reserve currency, all of which qualitatively indicates that historical credit loss information should be minimally affected by current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For collateralized loan obligations and debt securities issued by local state and political subdivisions, these securities are investment grade and highly rated and carry either sufficient credit enhancement or days cash on hand to support timely payments of principal and interest. As a result, the Company does not expect any future payment defaults and has t recorded an allowance for credit losses for its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Residential real estate loans collateralized by properties that were in the process of foreclosure totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the course of evaluating the credit risk presented by a customer and the pricing that will adequately compensate the Company for assuming that risk, management may require a certain amount of collateral support. The type of collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, land, buildings, equipment, income-producing commercial properties and residential real estate. The Company applies the same collateral policy for loans whether they are funded immediately or on a delayed basis. The loan and lease portfolio is principally located in Hawaii and, to a lesser extent, on the U.S. Mainland, Guam and Saipan. The risk inherent in the portfolio depends upon both the economic stability of the state or territories, which affects property values, and the financial strength and creditworthiness of the borrowers.

The review provides management with periodic information as to the quality of the loan portfolio and effectiveness of the Company s lending policies and procedures. The objective of the loan review and grading or scoring procedures is to identify, in a timely manner, existing or emerging credit quality issues so that appropriate steps can be initiated to avoid or minimize future losses. Loans and leases subject to grading primarily include: commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and lease financing. Other loans subject to grading include installment loans to businesses or individuals for business and commercial purposes, overdraft lines of credit, commercial credit cards, and other credits as may be determined. Credit quality indicators for internally graded loans and leases are generally updated on an annual basis or on a quarterly basis for those loans and leases deemed to be of potentially higher risk.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized interest income of million and million, respectively, on nonaccrual loans and leases. Furthermore, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount of accrued interest receivables written off by reversing interest income was million and million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount of accrued interest receivables written off by reversing interest income was million and million, respectively. Collateral-Dependent Loans and Leases Collateral-dependent loans and leases are those for which repayment (on the basis of the Company s assessment as of the reporting date) is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of collateral-dependent loans were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, these loans were primarily collateralized by residential real estate property and borrower assets and the fair value of collateral on substantially all collateral-dependent loans were significantly in excess of their amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2023, these loans were primarily collateralized by residential real estate property and the fair value of collateral on substantially all collateral-dependent loans were significantly in excess of their amortized cost basis. Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty Commercial and industrial loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may be modified through interest rate reductions, term extensions, and converting revolving credit lines to term loans. Modifications of commercial real estate and construction loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may involve reducing the interest rate for the remaining term of the loan or extending the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. Modifications of construction loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may also involve extending the interest-only payment period. Interest continues to accrue on the missed payments and as a result, the effective yield on the loan remains unchanged. Modifications of residential real estate loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may be comprised of loans where monthly payments are lowered to accommodate the borrowers' financial needs for a period of time, including extended interest-only periods and reamortization of the balance. Modifications of consumer loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may involve interest rate reductions and term extensions. Loans modified with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, whether in default or not, may already be on nonaccrual status and in some cases, partial charge-offs may have already been taken against the outstanding loan balance. Loans modified with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are evaluated for impairment. As a result, this may have a financial effect of impacting the specific ACL associated with the loan. An ACL for impaired commercial loans, including commercial real estate and construction loans, is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral-dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs. An ACL for impaired residential real estate loans is measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs. Management exercises significant judgment in developing these estimates.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Investments The Company has a limited partnership interest or is a member in a limited liability company LLC in several low-income housing partnerships. These partnerships or LLCs provide funds for the construction and operation of apartment complexes that provide affordable housing to that segment of the population with lower family income. If these developments successfully attract a specified percentage of residents falling in that lower income range, state and/or federal income tax credits are made available to the partners or members. The tax credits are generally recognized over 5 or 10 years. In order to continue receiving the tax credits each year over the life of the partnership or LLC, the low-income residency targets must be maintained. The Company generally accounts for its interests in these low-income housing partnerships using the proportional amortization method. The Company had million and million in affordable housing and other tax credit investment partnership interests as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, included in other assets on the unaudited interim consolidated balance sheets.

 interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million, with a negative fair value totaling million. The swaps matured in April 2024. The Company received fixed rates ranging from to and paid 1-month BSBY. The Company also utilized interest rate collars to manage interest rate risk and protect against downside risk in yields associated with interest payments received on a pool of floating-rate assets. The floating-rate index of the collars (Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR corresponds to the floating-rate nature of the interest receipts being hedged (based on SOFR). Interest rate collars involve the payments of variable-rate amounts if the collar index exceeds the cap strike rate on the contract and receipts of variable-rate amounts if the collar index falls below the floor strike rate on the contract. No payments are required if the collar index falls between the cap and floor rates. By hedging with interest rate collars, the Company mitigates the adverse impact on interest income associated with possible future decreases in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company carried interest rate collars with notional amounts totaling million. As of September 30, 2024, these interest rate collars had a positive fair value of million. As of December 31, 2023, these interest rate collars had a positive fair value of million. The collars mature in 2025 and 2027. The interest rate collars had a floor strike rate of and cap strike rates ranging from to . The interest rate swaps and collars are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. To the extent that the hedge is considered highly effective, the gain or loss on the interest rate swaps and collars is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Visa Class B Restricted Shares In 2016, the Company recorded a million net realized gain related to the sale of Visa Class B restricted shares. Concurrent with the sale of the Visa Class B restricted shares, the Company entered into a funding swap agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa reduces each member bank s Class B conversion rate to unrestricted Class A common shares. During 2018 through 2023, Visa funded its litigation escrow account, thereby reducing each member bank s Class B conversion rate to unrestricted Class A common shares from to . Under the terms of the funding swap agreement, the Company will make monthly payments to the buyer based on Visa s Class A stock price and the number of Visa Class B restricted shares that were sold until the date on which the covered litigation is settled. In April 2024, Visa, Inc. commenced an initial exchange offer Visa Exchange Offer for all of its outstanding Class B shares (subsequently renamed as Class B-1 shares ), of which the buyer elected and Visa, Inc. accepted. The buyer received a combination of Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C shares in exchange for the Class B-1 shares previously owned by the Company. Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C shares have a current conversion rate to Class A common shares of and , respectively. The Company took this exchange into consideration when valuing the derivative liability Visa derivative at September 30, 2024. The Visa derivative of million was included in the unaudited interim consolidated balance sheets at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, to provide for the fair value of this liability. There were no sales of these shares prior to 2016. See Note 16. Fair Value for more information. Counterparty Credit Risk By using derivatives, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk if counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, the Company s counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset, net of cash or other collateral received, and net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty to the extent master netting arrangements exist. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value.

 million. For each counterparty, the Company reviews the interest rate swap collateral daily. Collateral for customer interest rate swap agreements, calculated as the pledged asset less loan balance, requires valuation of the pledged asset. Counterparty credit risk adjustments of were recognized during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Credit-Risk Related Contingent Features Certain of the Company s derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if the Company s credit rating were to be downgraded by certain major credit rating agencies as a result of a merger or material adverse change in the Company s financial condition, the counterparty could require an early termination of derivative instruments. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position was at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, for which the Company posted in collateral in the normal course of business. If the Company s credit rating had been downgraded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company may have been required to settle the contracts in an amount equal to their fair value. million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company also had commitments for commercial and similar letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce whereby the commitment is typically drawn upon when the underlying transaction between the customer and a third-party is consummated. The maximum amount of potential future payments guaranteed by the Company is limited to the contractual amount of these letters. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held supports those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2024 have maturities ranging from October 2024 to May 2028. Substantially all fees received from the issuance of such commitments are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the commitment. Financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows: Standby letters of credit Commercial letters of credit Guarantees The Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation that may potentially require repurchase under certain conditions. This risk is managed through the Company s underwriting practices. The Company services loans sold to investors and loans originated by other originators under agreements that may include repurchase remedies if certain servicing requirements are not met. This risk is managed through the Company s quality assurance and monitoring procedures. Management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions. Foreign Exchange Contracts The Company has forward foreign exchange contracts that represent commitments to purchase or sell foreign currencies at a future date at a specified price. The Company s utilization of forward foreign exchange contracts is subject to the primary underlying risk of movements in foreign currency exchange rates and to additional counterparty risk should its counterparties fail to meet the terms of their contracts. Forward foreign exchange contracts are utilized to mitigate the Company s risk to satisfy customer demand for foreign currencies and are not used for trading purposes. See Note 11. Derivative Financial Instruments for more information. Reorganization Transactions On April 1, 2016, a series of reorganization transactions were undertaken to facilitate FHI s initial public offering. In connection with the reorganization transactions, FHI distributed its interest in BancWest Holding Inc. BWHI ), including Bank of the West BOW ), to BNP Paribas BNPP so that BWHI was held directly by BNPP. As a result of the reorganization transactions that occurred on April 1, 2016, various tax or other contingent liabilities could arise related to the business of BOW, or related to the Company s operations prior to the reorganization transactions when it was known as BancWest Corporation, including its then wholly owned subsidiary, BOW. The Company is not able to determine the ultimate outcome or estimate the amounts of these contingent liabilities, if any, at this time. The Company recorded an increase to other noninterest expense of million and an equal offsetting decrease of million to the provision for income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to adjustments made to certain of these uncertain tax liabilities.

The guidance explicitly excludes net interest income from financial assets and liabilities as well as other noninterest income from loans, leases, investment securities, derivative financial instruments and bank-owned life insurance. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the Company s revenues under the scope of Topic 606 were related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time. The following is a discussion of revenues within the scope of Topic 606. Service Charges on Deposit Accounts Service charges on deposit accounts relate to fees generated from a variety of deposit products and services rendered to customers. Charges include, but are not limited to, overdraft fees, non-sufficient fund fees, dormant fees and monthly service charges. Such fees are recognized concurrent with the event on a daily basis or on a monthly basis depending upon the customer s cycle date. Credit and Debit Card Fees Credit and debit card fees primarily represent revenues earned from interchange fees, ATM fees and merchant processing fees. Interchange and network revenues are earned on credit and debit card transactions conducted with payment networks. ATM fees are primarily earned as a result of surcharges assessed to non-FHB customers who use an FHB ATM. Merchant processing fees are primarily earned on transactions in which FHB is the acquiring bank. Such fees are generally recognized concurrently with the delivery of services on a daily basis. Trust and Investment Services Fees Trust and investment services fees represent revenue earned by directing, holding and managing customers assets. Fees are generally computed based on a percentage of the previous period s value of assets under management. The transaction price (i.e., percentage of assets under management) is established at the inception of each contract. Trust and investment services fees also include fees collected when the Company acts as agent or personal representative and executes security transactions, performs collection and disbursement of income, and completes investment management and other administrative tasks.

 vendors in prior years and vendors in the current year, which are being amortized over the term of the respective contracts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had contract liabilities of million and million, respectively, which it expects to recognize over the remaining term of the respective contracts with the vendors. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s recognized revenues increased and contract liabilities decreased by approximately million and million, respectively, due to the passage of time. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s recognized revenues increased and contract liabilities decreased by approximately million and million, respectively, due to the passage of time. There were changes in contract liabilities due to changes in transaction price estimates.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were material receivables from contracts with customers or contract assets recorded on the Company s unaudited interim consolidated balance sheets. Other Except for the contract liabilities noted above, the Company did t have any significant performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company also did t have any material contract acquisition costs or use any significant judgments or estimates in recognizing revenue for financial reporting purposes. adjustments to net income for the purpose of computing earnings per share and there were antidilutive securities.

Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C shares have a current conversion rate to Class A common shares of and , respectively. The Visa derivative of million was included in the unaudited interim consolidated balance sheets at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to provide for the fair value of this liability. The potential liability related to this funding swap agreement was determined based on management s estimate of the timing and the amount of Visa s litigation settlement and the resulting payments due to the counterparty under the terms of the contract. As such, the funding swap agreement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s funding swap agreement are the potential future changes in the Class B-2 conversion rate, expected term and growth rate of the market price of Visa Class A common shares. Material increases (or decreases) in any of those inputs may result in a significantly higher (or lower) fair value measurement.

 Changes in Fair Value Levels For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were transfers between fair value hierarchy levels. The changes in Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized below: ) Total net losses included in other noninterest income ) ) Settlements Balance as of September 30, ) ) Total net losses included in net income attributable to the change in unrealized losses related to liabilities still held as of September 30, ) ) Nine Months Ended September 30, Balance as of January 1, ) ) Total net losses included in other noninterest income ) ) Settlements Balance as of September 30, ) ) Total net losses included in net income attributable to the change in unrealized losses related to liabilities still held as of September 30, ) ) Assets and Liabilities Carried at Other Than Fair Value The following tables summarize for the periods indicated the estimated fair value of the Company s financial instruments that are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding leases and deposit liabilities with no defined or contractual maturity.

 (1) Excludes financing leases of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. (2) Excludes deposit liabilities with no defined or contractual maturity of billion as of September 30, 2024 and billion as of December 31, 2023. Unfunded loan and lease commitments and letters of credit are not included in the tables above. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had billion of unfunded loan and lease commitments and letters of credit. The Company believes that a reasonable estimate of the fair value of these instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the related reserve for unfunded commitments, which totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. No active trading market exists for these instruments, and the estimated fair value does not include value associated with the borrower relationship. The Company does not estimate the fair values of certain unfunded loan and lease commitments that can be canceled by providing notice to the borrower. As Company-level data is incorporated into the fair value measurement, unfunded loan and lease commitments and letters of credit are classified as Level 3. Valuation Techniques Used in the Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities Carried at the Lower of Cost or Fair Value The Company applies the following valuation techniques to assets measured at the lower of cost or fair value: Mortgage servicing rights MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are therefore subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. The fair value of MSRs is determined using models which use significant unobservable inputs, such as estimates of prepayment rates, the resultant weighted average lives of the MSRs and the option-adjusted spread levels. Accordingly, the Company classifies MSRs as Level 3. Collateral-dependent loans Collateral-dependent loans are those for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. These loans are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using collateral values as a practical expedient. The fair values of collateral are primarily based on real estate appraisal reports prepared by third-party appraisers less estimated selling costs. The Company may also use another available source of collateral assessment, such as purchase offers, letters of intent, or broker price opinions, to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of other collateral such as business assets is typically ascertained by assessing inventory listings and borrower s financial statements less estimated selling costs. The Company measures the estimated credit losses on collateral-dependent loans by performing a lower of cost or fair value analysis. If the estimated credit losses are determined by the value of the collateral, the net carrying amount is adjusted to fair value on a nonrecurring basis as Level 3 by recognizing an ACL. Other real estate owned The Company values these properties at fair value at the time the Company acquires them, which establishes their new cost basis. After acquisition, the Company carries such properties at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is measured on a nonrecurring basis using collateral values as a practical expedient. The fair values of collateral for other real estate owned are primarily based on real estate appraisal reports prepared by third-party appraisers less disposition costs, and are classified as Level 3.

 The Company recognized a reduction in expected credit losses on collateral-dependent loans of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Total expected credit losses recognized on collateral-dependent loans were million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were assets with nonrecurring fair value adjustments held as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, there were nonrecurring fair value adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. business segments Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, and Treasury and Other. These segments reflect how discrete financial information is currently evaluated by the chief operating decision maker and how performance is assessed and resources allocated. The Company s internal management process measures the performance of these business segments. This process, which is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution, uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments, including allocations of income, expense, the provision for credit losses, and capital. This process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and other subjective factors. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to GAAP. The net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to the Company s overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis. The basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of the Company s assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rates and market conditions. Funds transfer pricing also serves to transfer interest rate risk to Treasury. The Company allocates the provision for credit losses from the Treasury and Other business segment (which is comprised of many of the Company s support units) to the Retail and Commercial business segments. These allocations are based on direct costs incurred by the Retail and Commercial business segments. Noninterest income and expense includes allocations from support units to the business segments. These allocations are based on actual usage where practicably calculated or by management s estimate of such usage. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment based on the consolidated effective income tax rate for the period shown. Business Segments Retail Banking Retail Banking offers a broad range of financial products and services to consumers and small businesses. Loan and lease products offered include residential and commercial mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and loans, automobile loans and leases, secured and unsecured lines of credit, installment loans and small business loans and leases. Deposit products offered include checking, savings, and time deposit accounts. Retail Banking also offers wealth management services. Products and services from Retail Banking are delivered to customers through banking locations throughout the State of Hawaii, Guam and Saipan.

Company Overview FHI is a bank holding company, which owns 100 of the outstanding common stock of FHB, its only direct, wholly owned subsidiary. FHB was founded in 1858 under the name Bishop Company and was the first successful banking partnership in the Kingdom of Hawaii and the second oldest bank formed west of the Mississippi River. The Bank operates its business through three operating segments: Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Treasury and Other. References to we, our, us, or the Company refer to the Parent and its subsidiary that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of FHI and its wholly owned subsidiary, FHB. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and accompanying notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Hawaii Economy Hawaii s economy remains relatively resilient in the wake of high consumer prices and the August 2023 wildfires that continue to affect the island of Maui. According to the State of Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, the statewide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate increased to 2.9 at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.8 at September 30, 2023. Nationally, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.1 at September 30, 2024 compared to 3.8 at September 30, 2023. Domestic visitor arrivals for the state remain stable, with the average daily domestic passenger counts for the first nine months of 2024 relatively similar to the average daily passenger counts during the first nine months of 2023, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. International visitor arrivals from Japan in the first nine months of 2024 have increased significantly as compared to the first nine months of each of the last three years, but the level of arrivals from Japan remains below pre-pandemic levels due to the weak yen.

 The local Oahu housing market has remained relatively stable, but is experiencing some softening as compared to previous years primarily due to high interest rates. According to the Honolulu Board of Realtors, the volume of single-family home sales increased by 5.8 , while condominium sales decreased by 5.6 , in each case when comparing the first nine months of 2024 with the same period in 2023. When comparing the first nine months of 2024 with the same period in 2022, however, the volume of single-family home sales decreased by 26.5 , while condominium sales decreased by 35.0 . The median price of a single-family home sold on Oahu in the first nine months of 2024 was 1,100,000, an increase of 4.8 from the same period in 2023. The median price of a condominium sold on Oahu in the first nine months of 2024 was 510,000, an increase of 1.0 from the same period in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at approximately 3.4 and 5.2 months, respectively. Effect of Recent Natural Disasters In early August of 2023, wildfires swept across several areas of Maui, impacting residents in upcountry Maui and devastating the historic town of Lahaina. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans in the Maui fire zones totaled approximately 98 million as of September 30, 2024. We require our borrowers to maintain adequate levels of insurance, including fire insurance on residential mortgages. Although we are working closely with our resident and business borrowers to navigate the post-disaster period, there still remains a great deal of uncertainty regarding their recovery, including how long it will be before rebuilding can start, the amounts of available insurance coverage, the availability of government assistance for our borrowers in the long run or whether their longer-term ability to repay their loans has been diminished. We also expect that the aftermath of the wildfires will continue to impact commercial activity throughout the island of Maui, but there remains much uncertainty as to how long it will take Maui to rebuild, return tourism to historic levels, and recover economically. Although the visitor count to Maui has been steadily increasing since August 2023, especially with the re-opening of West Maui in late 2023, visitor arrivals in the first three quarters of 2024 are still lower than visitor arrivals in the first three quarters of 2023 and before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. Since there is significant uncertainty with respect to the full extent of the negative impacts of the wildfires, the Company s estimates concerning the impact of the wildfires, including those with respect to the loan portfolio potentially impacted, are based on judgment as of the date of this report and subject to change as conditions evolve. We will continue to closely monitor the impact that the wildfires has on our customers and will adjust the means by which we assist our customers during this period of financial and emotional hardship. Other Economic Developments As of September 30, 2024, the Company was well-capitalized and met all applicable regulatory capital requirements, including a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.03 , compared to the minimum requirement of 4.50 . For additional discussions regarding our capital and liquidity positions and related risks, refer to the sections titled Liquidity and Capital Resources and Capital in this MD A. Economic conditions and therefore our results of operations may be impacted by a variety of other factors as well, such as other natural disasters, an economic slowdown or recession, financial market volatility, supply chain disruptions, monetary and fiscal policy measures, heightened geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, such as the most recently announced 0.5 interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the political and regulatory environment, including the outcome of the U.S. 2024 elections, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and potential changes in tax laws.

(2) Return on average tangible assets, return on average tangible stockholders equity, tangible book value per share and tangible stockholders equity to tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We compute our return on average tangible assets as the ratio of net income to average tangible assets. We compute our return on average tangible stockholders equity as the ratio of net income to average tangible stockholders equity. We compute our tangible book value per share as the ratio of tangible stockholders equity to outstanding shares. We compute our tangible stockholders equity to tangible assets as the ratio of tangible stockholders equity to tangible assets. We believe that these financial measures are useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate financial performance and capital adequacy relative to other financial institutions. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by shareholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

 Financial Highlights Net income was 61.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.3 million or 6 as compared to the same period in 2023. Basic and diluted earnings per share were both 0.48 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.02 per share or 4 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to a 7.2 million increase in noninterest income and a 3.2 million decrease in the provision for income taxes. This was partially offset by a 6.8 million increase in noninterest expense and a 0.4 million decrease in net interest income. Our return on average total assets was 1.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of nine basis points from the same period in 2023, and our return on average total stockholders equity was 9.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 31 basis points from the same period in 2023. Our return on average tangible assets was 1.06 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of nine basis points from the same period in 2023, and our return on average tangible stockholders equity was 15.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 149 basis points from the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in average tangible equity, which resulted in part from a decrease in net unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by higher net income. Our efficiency ratio was 59.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 58.31 for the same period in 2023. Our results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were highlighted by the following: Net interest income was 156.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.4 million or less than one percent as compared to the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin was 2.95 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of nine basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by higher earning asset yields driven by higher yields in our loan and lease portfolio and higher average balances on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks. The provision for credit losses (the Provision was 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.1 million or 1 as compared to the same period in 2023. The Provision is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses for loans and leases (the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at levels deemed adequate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio and unfunded loan and lease commitments as of the balance sheet date. Noninterest income was 53.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.2 million or 16 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to a 2.6 million increase in bank-owned life insurance BOLI income, a 2.2 million increase in other service charges and fees, a 1.8 million increase in credit and debit card fees and a 0.9 million increase in other noninterest income, partially offset by a 0.7 million decrease in trust and investment services income. Noninterest expense was 126.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.8 million or 6 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a 4.3 million increase in other noninterest expense, stemming from a 3.8 million increase due to adjustments of certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions. This increase was offset by a 3.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Increases in noninterest expense also stemmed from a 3.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and a 1.3 million increase in equipment expense, partially offset by a 1.8 million decrease in contracted services and professional fees and a 0.7 million decrease in regulatory assessment and fees. Net income was 177.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9.8 million or 5 as compared to the same period in 2023. Basic earnings per share was 1.39 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.08 per share or 5 as compared to the same period in 2023. Diluted earnings per share was 1.38 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.09 per share or 6 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a 20.3 million decrease in net interest income and an 18.2 million increase in noninterest expense. This was partially offset by a 14.0 million increase in noninterest income, a 9.0 million decrease in the provision for income taxes and a 5.8 million decrease in the Provision.

Our return on average tangible assets was 1.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of three basis points from the same period in 2023, and our return on average tangible stockholders equity was 15.43 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 325 basis points from the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in average tangible equity, which resulted in part from a decrease in net unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio, and lower net income. Our efficiency ratio was 60.38 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 56.86 for the same period in 2023. Our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were highlighted by the following: Net interest income was 464.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 20.3 million or 4 as compared to the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin was 2.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of three basis points as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by higher earning asset yields driven by higher yields in our loan and lease portfolio and higher average balances on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks. The Provision was 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5.8 million or 27 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in the provision for construction loans and home equity lines and the provision for unfunded commercial and industrial and construction commitments. This was partially offset by increases in the provision for residential mortgage loans, consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at levels deemed adequate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio and unfunded loan and lease commitments as of the balance sheet date. Noninterest income was 156.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.0 million or 10 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to a 5.0 million increase in other service charges and fees, a 3.9 million increase in other noninterest income, a 2.1 million increase in credit and debit card fees, a 1.9 million increase in BOLI income and a 1.1 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense was 377.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 18.2 million or 5 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a 7.1 million increase in equipment expense, a 6.7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a 3.7 million increase in regulatory assessment and fees, a 3.5 million increase in other noninterest expense and a 1.8 million increase in card rewards program expense, partially offset by a 3.8 million decrease in contracted services and professional fees and a 0.8 million decrease in occupancy expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to maintain high levels of liquidity and adequate reserves for credit losses. We also remained well-capitalized. Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 was 13.03 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 64 basis points from December 31, 2023. The increase in CET1 was primarily due to earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the dividends declared and paid to the Company s stockholders. Total loans and leases were 14.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 112.1 million or 1 from December 31, 2023. The decrease in total loans and leases was primarily due to decreases in residential real estate loans, consumer loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by increases in construction loans and lease financing. The ACL was 163.7 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.2 million or 5 from December 31, 2023. The ratio of our ACL to total loans and leases outstanding was 1.15 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of six basis points compared to December 31, 2023.

Total deposits were 20.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.1 billion or 5 from December 31, 2023. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to a 783.5 million decrease in demand deposit balances, a 549.1 million decrease in savings deposit balances and a 53.9 million decrease in time deposit balances, partially offset by a 281.5 million increase in money market deposit balances.

Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 157.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.8 million or 1 compared to the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin was 2.95 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of nine basis points from the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by higher earning asset yields driven by higher yields in our loan and lease portfolio and higher average balances on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Deposit funding costs were 87.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12.8 million or 17 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest rates. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 2.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 35 basis points compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to rate increases. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our investment securities portfolio was 6.0 billion, a decrease of 1.0 billion or 15 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to payments and maturities, in addition to the sale of securities in late 2023. The yield on our loan and lease portfolio was 5.74 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 35 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher rates on new loan originations. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks was 1.0 billion, an increase of 411.8 million or 68 compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, average balances, related income and expenses, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, and resulting yields and rates are presented in Table 5. An analysis of the change in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, is presented in Table 6.

 (1) The change in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns. Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 468.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 20.5 million or 4 compared to the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin was 2.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of three basis points from the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was driven by the interest rate environment and was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by higher earning asset yields driven by higher yields in our loan and lease portfolio and higher average balances on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Deposit funding costs were 257.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 81.3 million or 46 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest rates. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 2.57 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 75 basis points compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to rate increases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance of our investment securities portfolio was 6.1 billion, a decrease of 1.1 billion or 16 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to payments and maturities, in addition to the sale of securities in late 2023. The yield on our loan and lease portfolio was 5.68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 49 basis points as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily to increased yields from our adjustable-rate loans and higher rates on loans that originated during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the average balance on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks was 884.6 million, an increase of 391.0 million or 79 compared to the same period in 2023.

 The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began in 2023 at 7.50 and increased 100 basis points (25 basis points each in February, March, May and July) to end the year at 8.50 . In September 2024, the prime rate decreased 50 basis points to 8.00 , where it remained as at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the SOFR. At September 30, 2024, the one-month and three-month CME Term SOFR interest rates were 4.85 and 4.59 , respectively. At September 30, 2023, the one-month and three-month CME Term SOFR interest rates were 5.32 and 5.40 , respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began in 2023 at 4.25 to 4.50 , and increased 100 basis points to end the year at 5.25 to 5.50 . As of August 31, 2024, the federal funds rate was in the range of 5.25 to 5.50 . Effective September 19, 2024, the Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 . There continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions, including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies related to the overall macroeconomic environment. Provision for Credit Losses The Provision was 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.1 million or 1 as compared to the same period in 2023. We recorded net charge-offs of loans and leases of 3.9 million and net recoveries of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represented net charge-offs of 0.11 and net recoveries of 0.01 of average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Provision was 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5.8 million or 27 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in the provision for construction loans and home equity lines and the provision for unfunded commercial and industrial and construction commitments. This was partially offset by increases in the provision for residential mortgage loans, consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans. We recorded net charge-offs of loans and leases of 10.2 million and 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represented net charge-offs of 0.10 and 0.06 of average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The ACL was 163.7 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.2 million or 5 from December 31, 2023 and represented 1.15 of total outstanding loans and leases as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.09 of total outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments was 33.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 35.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at levels deemed adequate by management based on the factors noted in the Risk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Credit Risk section of this MD A.

This was partially offset by a 2.8 million decrease in ATM interchange and surcharge fees, a 1.1 million decrease in merchant service revenues and a 0.6 million decrease in rental fees from credit card terminals. Other service charges and fees were 11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.2 million or 24 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 2.1 million increase in fees from annuities and securities. Other service charges and fees were 32.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.0 million or 18 as compared to the same period in 2023.

BOLI income was 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.6 million as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 2.4 million increase in BOLI earnings and a 0.3 million increase in death benefit proceeds from life insurance policies. BOLI income was 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.9 million or 18 as compared to the same period in 2023.

 Other noninterest income was 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.9 million or 56 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 1.5 million tax refund received during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 0.7 million increase in customer-related interest rate swap fees, a 0.3 million increase in income due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions, 0.2 million in insurance proceeds received in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and a 0.2 million increase in net credit card equipment sales.

 Salaries and employee benefits expense was 59.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.6 million or 6 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 3.7 million increase in incentive compensation, a 0.7 million increase in retirement plan expenses and a 0.4 million increase in other compensation, primarily related to adjustments made to the deferred compensation plan as a result of market conditions, partially offset by a decrease in nonrecurring separation agreements and severance costs . Additionally, these increases were partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in base salaries and related payroll taxes and a 0.6 million decrease in state unemployment tax expense. Salaries and employee benefits expense was 176.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.7 million or 4 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 5.9 million increase in incentive compensation, a 2.0 million decrease in payroll and benefit costs being deferred as loan origination costs, a 1.1 million increase in retirement plan expenses, a 0.7 million increase in group health plan costs and a 0.5 million increase in base salaries and related payroll taxes. This was partially offset by a 1.6 million decrease in other compensation, primarily related to nonrecurring separation agreements and severance costs recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by adjustments made to the deferred compensation plan as a result of market conditions. Other decreases included a 0.8 million decrease in employee overtime pay expense and a 0.7 million decrease in state unemployment tax expense. Contracted services and professional fees were 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.8 million or 11 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 1.3 million decrease in outside services, primarily attributable to technology-related projects, marketing and new customer services and a 0.5 million decrease in audit, legal and consultant fees. Contracted services and professional fees were 46.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 3.8 million or 7 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 3.5 million decrease in outside services, primarily attributable to non-technology-related projects, marketing and new customer services and a 0.3 million decrease in audit, legal and consultant fees. Occupancy expense was 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.2 million or 3 as compared to the same period in 2023. Occupancy expense was 21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.8 million or 4 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 0.6 million increase in net sublease rental income and a 0.3 million decrease in building depreciation. Equipment expense was 13.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.3 million or 11 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 1.3 million increase in technology-related amortization and licensing and maintenance fees. Equipment expense was 39.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.1 million or 22 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 7.0 million increase in technology-related amortization and licensing and maintenance fees. Regulatory assessment and fees were 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.7 million or 18 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment. Regulatory assessment and fees were 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.7 million or 32 as compared to the same period in 2023. During 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule for a special assessment to replenish the deposit insurance fund following bank failures occurring earlier in the year. As a result, the Company previously recorded a related loss of 16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the FDIC issued a notice that the original loss estimate related to the 2023 bank failures was subsequently increased and that this increase would result in an additional assessment expense to affected institutions. The Company estimated a related loss of 4.1 million, which was recorded in the first quarter of 2024 . This estimate was later adjusted by 0.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 to bring the net loss related to the special assessment to 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Advertising and marketing expense was 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.5 million or 21 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a 0.5 million decrease in advertising costs. Advertising and marketing expense was 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a minimal change as compared to the same period in 2023.

This increase was primarily due to a 1.3 million increase in credit card cash reward redemptions and a 1.0 million increase in interchange fees paid to our credit card partners, partially offset by a 0.4 million decrease in international transaction fees. Other noninterest expense was 18.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.3 million or 31 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 3.8 million increase in expense due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and a 1.7 million increase in operational losses and other charge-offs, partially offset by a 0.6 million decrease in business privilege tax expense and a 0.4 million decrease in losses incurred due to natural disasters. Other noninterest expense was 45.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.5 million or 8 as compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 3.8 million increase in expense due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions, a 2.4 million increase in operational losses and other charge-offs and 0.7 million in costs associated with a fund acquired by the Company. This was partially offset by a 1.1 million decrease in business privilege tax expense, a 0.9 million decrease in pension-related expenses, a 0.6 million decrease in losses incurred due to natural disasters and a 0.4 million decrease in other insurance expense. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was 15.0 million (an effective tax rate of 19.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a provision for income taxes of 18.1 million (an effective tax rate of 23.76 for the same period in 2023. The provision for income taxes was 50.2 million (an effective tax rate of 22.04 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a provision for income taxes of 59.2 million (an effective tax rate of 24.00 for the same period in 2023. The change in the effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 3.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes due to the aforementioned adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions.

 Net income for the Retail Banking segment was 58.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 9.5 million or 20 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net income for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to a 7.3 million increase in net interest income, a 4.9 million decrease in noninterest expense and a 1.8 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a 3.3 million increase in the provision for income taxes and a 1.0 million increase in the Provision. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit spreads. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Retail Banking segment and a decrease in business privilege tax expense, partially offset by an increase in operational losses. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to an increase in other service charges and fees, partially offset by a decrease in trust and investment services income. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher allocated provision expenses to the Retail Banking segment.

The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit and loan spreads. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Retail Banking segment, partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits expense and regulatory assessment and fees. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in other service charges and fees, service charges on deposit accounts and net mortgage servicing rights income. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher allocated provision expenses to the Retail Banking segment. Commercial Banking. Our Commercial Banking segment includes our corporate banking related products, commercial real estate loans, commercial lease financing, secured and unsecured lines of credit, automobile loans and auto dealer financing, business deposit products and credit cards that we provide primarily to middle market and large companies locally, nationally and internationally. Net income for the Commercial Banking segment was 34.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.3 million or 22 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to a 3.3 million decrease in noninterest expense, a 2.8 million increase in noninterest income and a 1.3 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a 1.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Commercial Banking segment and a decrease in salaries and benefits expense. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in credit and debit card fees, a tax refund received during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an increase in customer-related interest rate swap fees, partially offset by a decrease in volume-based incentives. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit spreads and average balances, partially offset by lower loan and lease spreads. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax income. Net income for the Commercial Banking segment was 91.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 19.4 million or 27 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to a 9.8 million decrease in noninterest expense, a 9.3 million increase in net interest income, a 2.4 million increase in noninterest income and a 1.3 million decrease in the Provision, partially offset by a 3.5 million increase in the provision for income taxes.

 Treasury and Other. Our Treasury and Other segment includes our treasury business, which consists of corporate asset and liability management activities, including interest rate risk management. The assets and liabilities (and related interest income and expense) of our treasury business consist of interest-bearing deposits, investment securities, federal funds sold and purchased, government deposits, short- and long-term borrowings and bank-owned properties. Our primary sources of noninterest income are from bank-owned life insurance, net gains from the sale of investment securities, foreign exchange income related to customer driven cross-border wires for business and personal reasons and management of bank-owned properties. The net residual effect of the transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in Treasury and Other, along with the elimination of intercompany transactions. Other organizational units (Technology, Operations, Credit and Risk Management, Human Resources, Finance, Administration, Marketing and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) provide a wide range of support to our other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the applicable business segments through an internal cost allocation process. Net loss for the Treasury and Other segment was 30.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of 18.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss for the Treasury and Other segment was primarily due to a 14.9 million increase in noninterest expense and a 9.0 million increase in net interest expense. This was partially offset by a 7.5 million increase in the benefit for income taxes, a 2.6 million increase in noninterest income and a 1.3 million decrease in the Provision. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower credit allocations to the Treasury and Other segment, an increase in salaries and benefits expense, an increase in expense due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and an increase in equipment expense. This was partially offset by a decrease in contracted services and professional fees. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in net transfer pricing charges that reside in the Treasury and Other segment and a decrease in interest income from investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from public deposits and borrowings and an increase in interest income from interest-bearing deposits in other banks. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was partially due to the adjustments of certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to an increase in BOLI income. The decrease in the Provision was primarily due to the decrease in the provision for unfunded commercial and industrial commitments, partially offset by increases in the provision for home equity line and construction commitments. Net loss for the Treasury and Other segment was 86.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss of 11.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a 76.5 million increase in net interest expense and a 37.1 million increase in noninterest expense. This was partially offset by a 27.7 million increase in the benefit for income taxes, a negative Provision of 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a Provision of 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a 5.5 million increase in noninterest income. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in net transfer pricing charges that reside in the Treasury and Other segment and a decrease in interest income from investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from public deposits and borrowings and an increase in interest income from interest-bearing deposits in other banks. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower credit allocations to the Treasury and Other segment, an increase in equipment expense, an increase in expense due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and increases in salaries and benefits expense and regulatory assessment and fees. This was partially offset by a decrease in contracted services and professional fees. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was partially due to the adjustments of certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions. The decrease in the Provision was primarily due to the decreases in the provision for unfunded commercial and industrial and construction commitments. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to insurance proceeds received in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in BOLI income. Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity refers to our ability to maintain cash flow that is adequate to fund operations and meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or by obtaining additional funding through liability management. We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength. Our objective is to manage our cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. 

 72 

Table of Contents 
 Liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit, deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory and internal guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability and off-balance sheet positions. The Company s Asset Liability Management Committee ALCO monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk. Immediate liquid resources are available in cash, which is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco FRB ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were 1.1 billion and 1.7 billion, respectively. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio and held-to-maturity portfolio. The carrying values of our available-for-sale investment securities and held-to-maturity investment securities were 2.1 billion and 3.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, respectively. The carrying values of our available-for-sale investment securities and held-to-maturity investment securities were 2.3 billion and 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we maintained our excess liquidity primarily in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Municipal Housing Authorities and non-agency entities. As of September 30, 2024, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with a weighted average life of approximately 4.3 years and our held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with a weighted average life of approximately 7.5 years. These funds offer substantial resources to meet either new loan demand or to help offset reductions in our deposit funding base as they provide quick sources of liquidity by pledging to obtain secured borrowings and repurchase agreements or sales of our available-for-sale securities portfolio. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines FHLB and the FRB. As of September 30, 2024, we have borrowing capacity of 2.9 billion from the FHLB and 3.1 billion from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged. Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost of funding. Our core deposits, defined as all deposits exclusive of time deposits exceeding 250,000, totaled 18.8 billion and 19.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented 93 and 91 of our total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company; however, deposit levels could decrease if interest rates increase significantly or if corporate customers increase investing activities, including alternative investment options, that reduce deposit balances. The Company s routine funding requirements are expected to consist primarily of general corporate needs and capital to be returned to our shareholders. We expect to meet these obligations from dividends paid by the Bank to the Parent. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include selling residential real estate loans in the secondary market, taking out short- and long-term borrowings and issuing long-term debt and equity securities. We typically have contractual obligations representing required future payments on certificates of deposits, borrowings, noncancelable operating leases, postretirement benefit contributions, purchase obligations and funding commitments on low-income housing tax credit investments. Our short-term borrowings decreased from 500.0 million as of December 31, 2023 to 250.0 million as of September 30, 2024. See Short-term Borrowings for further details. Other than this change, there have been no material changes to the cash requirements from our current and long-term contractual obligations previously reported as of December 31, 2023. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments, and cash expected to be generated from operations, are still sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond. Potential Demands on Liquidity from Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have off-balance sheet arrangements, such as variable interest entities, guarantees, and certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, that may affect the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Table of Contents 
 Variable Interest Entities We hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities VIEs ). These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low-income housing tax credit investments in partnerships and limited liability companies. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity s net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. Based on our analysis, we have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs. Unfunded commitments to fund these low-income housing tax credit investments were 112.3 million and 80.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Guarantees We sell residential mortgage loans on the secondary market, primarily to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and other matters. The unpaid principal balance of our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold was 1.3 billion as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met in the origination of those loans. Upon receipt of a repurchase request, we work with investors to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution. Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred. We manage the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through our underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a 0.6 million pending repurchase request of a residential mortgage loan, however there were no completed repurchases. In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, substantially all of the loans we sell to investors are sold with servicing rights retained. We also service loans originated by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans, or loan modifications or short sales. Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor. These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company. Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had no repurchase requests related to loan servicing activities, nor were there any pending repurchase requests as of September 30, 2024. Although to-date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions and servicing activities have been limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency as investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. However, as of September 30, 2024, management believes that this exposure is not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends and thus has not established a liability for losses related to mortgage loan repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, 99 of our residential mortgage loans serviced for investors were current. We maintain ongoing communications with investors and continue to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in loans sold to investors.

 (1) Weighted-average yields were computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. (2) Maturities for mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations anticipate future prepayments. The carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was 5.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 387.1 million or 6 compared to December 31, 2023. Our available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income or through the Provision. Our held-to-maturity investment securities are carried at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024, we maintained all of our investment securities in either the available-for-sale category (recorded at fair value) or the held-to-maturity category (recorded at amortized cost) in the unaudited interim consolidated balance sheets, with 3.2 billion invested in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our investment securities portfolio also included 2.3 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Municipal Housing Authorities and non-agency entities, 208.9 million in collateralized loan obligations, 83.5 million in debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, government agencies (U.S. International Development Finance Corporation bonds) and government-sponsored enterprises and 54.5 million in debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions. We continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities and change the composition of our investment securities portfolio.

 Gross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were 0.7 million and 0.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Gross unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio were 614.1 million and 770.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in unrealized loss was primarily due to lower market interest rates as of September 30, 2024, relative to December 31, 2023, resulting in a higher valuation. Additionally, the decrease in unrealized loss positions were primarily related to our collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed securities, the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. For our available-for-sale investment securities, we conduct a regular assessment of our investment securities portfolio to determine whether any securities are impaired. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through the allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not record any credit losses related to our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. For our held-to-maturity investment securities, we utilize the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses. Substantially all of our held-to-maturity securities are issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. These securities have a long history of no credit losses and carry the explicit or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we did not record an allowance for credit losses related to our held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio. We are required to hold non-marketable equity securities, comprised of FHLB stock, as a condition of our membership in the FHLB system. Our FHLB stock is accounted for at cost, which equals par or redemption value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 21.3 million and 32.6 million in FHLB stock, respectively, which is recorded as a component of other assets in our unaudited interim consolidated balance sheets. See Note 2. Investment Securities contained in our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for more information on our investment securities portfolio. Loans and Leases Table 14 presents the composition of our loan and lease portfolio by major categories as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

Loans and Leases Table 14 September 30, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Commercial and industrial 2,110,077 2,165,349 Commercial real estate 4,265,289 4,340,243 Construction 1,056,249 900,292 Residential: Residential mortgage 4,187,060 4,283,315 Home equity line 1,159,823 1,174,588 Total residential 5,346,883 5,457,903 Consumer 1,030,044 1,109,901 Lease financing 432,828 379,809 Total loans and leases 14,241,370 14,353,497 Total loans and leases were 14.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, a nominal decrease of 1 from December 31, 2023. The decrease in total loans and leases was primarily due to decreases in residential real estate loans, consumer loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by increases in construction loans and lease financing.

 Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily to corporations, middle market and small businesses for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital and other general business purposes. We also offer a variety of automobile dealer flooring lines to our customers in Hawaii and California to assist with the financing of their inventory. Commercial and industrial loans were 2.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 55.3 million or 3 from December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate loans are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan to value LTV ratios generally not exceeding 75 and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1. The commercial properties are predominantly apartments, neighborhood and grocery anchored retail, industrial, office, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels. The primary source of repayment for investor property and owner-occupied property is cash flow from the property and operating cash flow from the business, respectively. Commercial real estate loans were 4.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 75.0 million or 2 from December 31, 2023. Construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property. Loans in this portfolio are primarily for the purchase of land, as well as for the development of commercial properties, single family homes and condominiums. We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase. Following completion of the construction phase, if a loan is retained by the Bank, the loan is converted to the commercial real estate or residential real estate classes of loans. Construction loans were 1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 156.0 million or 17 from December 31, 2023. The increase in construction loans was primarily due to draws on existing lines during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Residential real estate loans are generally secured by 1-4 unit residential properties and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income DTI ratios, liquidity and credit scores. LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80 , although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. We offer fixed rate mortgage products and variable rate mortgage products including home equity lines of credit. Since our transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR in late 2021, we now offer variable rate mortgage products based on SOFR with interest rates that are subject to change every six months after the third, fifth, seventh or tenth year, depending on the product. Prior to this, we offered variable rate mortgage products based on LIBOR with interest rates that were subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth or tenth year, depending on the product. Variable rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. We generally do not offer interest-only, payment-option facilities, Alt-A loans or any product with negative amortization. Residential real estate loans were 5.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 111.0 million or 2 from December 31, 2023. Consumer loans consist primarily of open- and closed-end direct and indirect credit facilities for personal, automobile and household purchases as well as credit card loans. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in consumer lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines, which include an evaluation of personal credit history, cash flow and collateral values based on existing market conditions. Consumer loans were 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 79.9 million or 7 from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to runoffs in the indirect automobile loan portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Lease financing consists of commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases. Underwriting of new lease transactions is based on our lending policy, including but not limited to an analysis of customer cash flows and secondary sources of repayment, including the value of leased equipment, the guarantors cash flows and/or other credit enhancements. No new leveraged leases are being added to the portfolio and all remaining leveraged leases are running off. Lease financing was 432.8 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 53.0 million or 14 from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the closing of several large lease transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 3. Loans and Leases and Note 4. Allowance for Credit Losses contained in our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the discussion in Analysis of Financial Condition Allowance for Credit Losses of this MD A for more information on our loan and lease portfolio.

For unsecured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on the location where the majority of the borrower s business operations are conducted. Our lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii. However, we also have lending activities on the U.S. mainland, Guam and Saipan. Our commercial lending activities on the U.S. mainland include automobile dealer flooring activities in California, participation in the Shared National Credits Program and selective commercial real estate projects based on existing customer relationships. Our lease financing portfolio includes commercial leveraged and single investor lease financing activities both in Hawaii and on the U.S. mainland. However, no new leveraged leases are being added to the portfolio and all remaining leveraged leases are running off. Our consumer lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii and, to a smaller extent, in Guam and Saipan.

 Credit Quality We perform an internal loan review and grading or scoring procedures on an ongoing basis. The review provides management with periodic information as to the quality of the loan portfolio and effectiveness of our lending policies and procedures. The objective of the loan review and grading or scoring procedures is to identify, in a timely manner, existing or emerging credit quality issues so that appropriate steps can be initiated to avoid or minimize future losses. For purposes of managing credit risk and estimating the ACL, management has identified three portfolio segments (commercial, residential and consumer) that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the ACL. The categorization of loans for the evaluation of credit risk is specific to our credit risk evaluation process and these loan categories are not necessarily the same as the loan categories used for other evaluations of our loan portfolio. See Note 4. Allowance for Credit Losses contained in our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for more information about our approach to estimating the ACL. The following tables and discussion address non-performing assets and loans and leases that are 90 days past due but are still accruing interest. Non-Performing Assets and Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest Table 19 presents information on our non-performing assets and accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 Table 20 presents the activity in Non-Performing Assets NPAs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Non-Performing Assets Table 20 Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Balance at beginning of period 18,595 11,996 Additions 8,311 8,025 Reductions Payments (6,234) (2,745) Return to accrual status (1,834) (2,289) Sales of other real estate owned (75) (91) Charge-offs/write-downs (929) (273) Total Reductions (9,072) (5,398) Balance at end of period 17,834 14,623 The level of NPAs represents an indicator of the potential for future credit losses. NPAs consist of non-accrual loans and leases and other real estate owned OREO ). Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to held for sale classification, transferred to OREO or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities. Total NPAs were 17.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.8 million or 4 from December 31, 2023. The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases and OREO was 0.13 as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The decrease in NPAs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a decrease in commercial real estate non-accrual loans of 2.8 million, partially offset by increases in residential mortgage non-accrual loans of 1.5 million and home equity line non-accrual loans of 0.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, commercial real estate non-accrual loans were 0.2 million, a decrease of 2.8 million or 95 from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to payments totaling 2.5 million and charge-offs of 0.4 million, partially offset by additions of 0.1 million. The largest component of our NPAs is typically residential mortgage loans. The level of these NPAs can remain elevated due to a lengthy judicial foreclosure process in Hawaii. As of September 30, 2024, residential mortgage non-accrual loans were 9.1 million, an increase of 1.5 million or 19 from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to additions of 3.8 million, partially offset by payments of 1.7 million and returns to accrual status of 0.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 37 loans with a weighted average current LTV ratio of 39 . As of September 30, 2024, home equity line non-accrual loans were 7.6 million, an increase of 0.6 million or 8 from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to additions totaling 3.4 million, partially offset by payments of 1.5 million and returns to accrual status of 1.3 million. OREO represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. OREO is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations. There was no OREO held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest. Loans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection. Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were 4.5 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.0 million or 30 from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in residential mortgage loans of 0.9 million and commercial real estate loans of 0.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans of 0.2 million, that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest.

 As of September 30, 2024, the ACL was 163.7 million or 1.15 of total loans and leases outstanding, compared with an ACL of 156.5 million or 1.09 of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments was 33.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 35.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs of loans and leases were 3.9 million or 0.11 of total average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net recoveries of loans and leases of 0.3 million or 0.01 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs in our commercial lending portfolio were 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net recoveries of 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net recoveries in our residential lending portfolio were 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net charge-offs in our consumer lending portfolio were 2.6 million and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolio segment include those related to credit cards, automobile loans, installment loans and small business lines of credit and reflect the inherent risk associated with these loans. Net charge-offs of loans and leases were 10.2 million or 0.10 of total average loans and leases on an annualized basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.5 million or 0.06 of total average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs in our commercial lending portfolio were 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net recoveries of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net recoveries in our residential lending portfolio were 0.3 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net charge-offs in our consumer lending portfolio were 8.0 million and 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolio segment include those related to credit card, automobile loans, installment loans and small business lines of credit and reflect the inherent risk associated with these loans. Although we determine the amount of each component of the ACL separately, the ACL as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024, the ACL was considered adequate based on our ongoing analysis of estimated expected credit losses, credit risk profiles, current economic outlook, coverage ratios and other relevant factors. The ACL anticipates cyclical losses consistent with a recession and includes a qualitative overlay for potential macroeconomic impacts. We will continue to monitor factors that drive expected credit losses including the uncertainty of the economy, inflation and geopolitical instability. See Note 4. Allowance for Credit Losses contained in our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for more information on the ACL. Goodwill Goodwill was 995.5 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our goodwill originated from the acquisition of the Company by BNP Paribas in December of 2001. Goodwill generated in that acquisition was recorded on the balance sheet of the Bank as a result of push down accounting treatment, and remains on our consolidated balance sheets. The Company s policy is to assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or between annual assessments if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. There was no impairment in our goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Future events, including geopolitical concerns, inflation concerns, global supply chain issues, and other factors affecting the economy, that could cause a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in our business or the business climate may necessitate taking charges in future reporting periods related to the impairment of our goodwill.

 Other Assets Other assets were 860.4 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.7 million or 2 from December 31, 2023. The increase in other assets was primarily due to increases of 33.7 million in low-income housing tax credit LIHTC investments, 14.7 million in accounts receivable and suspense accounts and 13.0 million in prepaid assets. This was partially offset by decreases of 34.5 million in municipal advances and 11.3 million in FHLB stock. Deposits Deposits are the primary funding source for the Bank and are acquired from a broad base of local markets, including both individual and corporate customers. We obtain funds from depositors by offering a range of deposit types, including demand, savings, money market and time. Table 25 presents the composition of our deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 

Deposits Table 25 September 30, December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 U.S.: Demand 6,006,013 6,609,483 Savings 5,430,112 5,986,066 Money Market 3,729,837 3,583,191 Time 2,985,792 3,162,658 Foreign (1) : Demand 794,015 974,079 Savings 465,917 459,018 Money Market 399,544 264,662 Time 416,472 293,500 Total Deposits (2) 20,227,702 21,332,657 

 (1) Foreign deposits were comprised of Guam and Saipan deposit accounts. (2) Public deposits were 1.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 778.4 million or 44 compared to December 31, 2023. Total deposits were 20.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.1 billion or 5 from December 31, 2023. The decrease in deposit balances stemmed primarily from a 788.8 million decrease in non-public demand deposit balances, a 647.6 million decrease in public time deposit balances, a 330.5 million decrease in non-public savings deposit balances and a 218.6 million decrease in public savings deposit balances. These decreases were partially offset by a 593.7 million increase in non-public time deposit balances, a 199.0 million increase in non-public money market deposit balances and a 82.5 million increase in public money market deposit balances. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of deposits that exceeded FDIC insurance limits were estimated to be 9.9 billion, or 49 of total deposits, and 10.8 billion, or 51 of total deposits, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 1.0 billion and 1.8 billion, respectively, of public deposits, all of which were fully collateralized with investment securities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of deposits excluding public deposits that exceeded FDIC insurance limits were estimated to be 8.9 billion, or 44 of total deposits, and 9.1 billion, or 42 of total deposits, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deposit accounts above 250,000 were estimated to be 11.6 billion and 12.6 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deposit balances over 250,000 in corporate operating accounts were estimated to be 1.9 billion and 2.3 billion, respectively.

 (1) Includes 257.0 million in public time deposits that are fully collateralized with investment securities. Short-term Borrowings As of September 30, 2024, the Company s short-term borrowings consisted of a 250.0 million short-term FHLB fixed-rate advance with a weighted average interest rate of 4.16 maturing in September 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Company s short-term borrowings consisted of 500.0 million in short-term FHLB fixed-rate advances with a weighted average interest rate of 4.71 that matured in September 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a remaining line of credit of 2.9 billion and 2.5 billion, respectively, available from the FHLB. The FHLB borrowing capacity was secured by commercial real estate and residential real estate loan collateral as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Pension and Postretirement Plan Obligations We have a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan, an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan SERP ), a directors retirement plan (a non-qualified pension plan for eligible directors) and a postretirement benefit plan providing life insurance and healthcare benefits that we offer to our directors and employees, as applicable. The noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan, the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan and the directors retirement plan are all frozen to new participants. On March 11, 2019, the Company s board of directors approved an amendment to the SERP to freeze the SERP. As a result of such amendment, effective July 1, 2019, there are no new accruals of benefits, including service accruals. To calculate annual pension costs, we use the following key variables: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate. Pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations, net of pension plan assets, were 91.2 million as of September 30, 2024, a nominal decrease from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to payments of 6.2 million, offset by net periodic benefit costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.7 million. See Note 15. Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense contained in our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Capital The bank regulators currently use a combination of risk-based ratios and a leverage ratio to evaluate capital adequacy. The Company and the Bank are subject to the federal bank regulators final rules implementing Basel III and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Capital Rules ). The Capital Rules, among other things impose a capital measure called CET1, to which most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital must be made. In addition, the Capital Rules specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain specified requirements. 

 87 

Table of Contents 
 Under the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are as follows: 4.5 CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 6.0 Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets, 8.0 Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets, and 4.0 Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets. 
 The Capital Rules also require a 2.5 capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7 CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 10.5 total capital to risk-weighted assets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s capital levels remained characterized as well-capitalized under the Capital Rules. Our regulatory capital ratios, calculated in accordance with the Capital Rules, are presented in Table 27 below. There have been no conditions or events since September 30, 2024 that management believes have changed either the Company s or the Bank s capital classifications. CET1 was 13.03 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 64 basis points from December 31, 2023. The increase in CET1 was primarily due to earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the dividends declared and paid to the Company s stockholders.

The increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to earnings for the period of 177.6 million and other comprehensive income, net of tax, of 77.6 million, primarily due to changes in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by dividends declared and paid to the Company s stockholders of 99.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In January 2024, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to 40.0 million of its outstanding common stock during 2024. The Company did not repurchase any common stock outstanding under this stock repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and, as a result, 40.0 million remained of the 40.0 million total repurchase amount authorized under the stock repurchase program for 2024 as of September 30, 2024. The timing and exact amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be subject to management s discretion and various factors, including the Company s capital position and financial performance, as well as market conditions. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. In October 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.26 per share on our outstanding shares. The dividend will be paid on November 29, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2024.

 Future Application of Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not adopted by us as of September 30, 2024, see Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for more information. Risk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Managing risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business. Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management and operational risk. See Analysis of Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources and Capital sections of this MD A for further discussions of liquidity risk management and capital management, respectively. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial, real estate and consumer credit policies, risk ratings and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history. Management has identified three categories of loans that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the ACL: commercial, residential and consumer. Commercial lending is further categorized into four distinct classes based on characteristics relating to the borrower, transaction and collateral. These classes are: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, construction and lease financing. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital and other general business purposes by medium to larger Hawaii based corporations, as well as U.S. mainland and international companies. Commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by non-real estate assets whereby the collateral is trading assets, enterprise value or inventory. As with many of our customers, our commercial and industrial loan customers are heavily dependent on tourism, government expenditures and real estate values. Commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate, including but not limited to structures and facilities to support activities designated as retail, health care, general office space, warehouse and industrial space. Our Bank s underwriting policy generally requires that net cash flows from the property be sufficient to service the debt while still maintaining an appropriate amount of reserves. Commercial real estate loans in Hawaii are characterized by having a limited supply of real estate at commercially attractive locations, long delivery time frames for development and high interest rate sensitivity. Our construction lending portfolio consists primarily of land loans, single family and condominium development loans. Financing of construction loans is subject to a high degree of credit risk given the long delivery time frames for such projects. Construction lending activities are underwritten on a project financing basis whereby the cash flows or lease rents from the underlying real estate collateral or the sale of the finished inventory is the primary source of repayment. Market feasibility analysis is typically performed by assessing market comparables, market conditions and demand in the specific lending area and general community. We require presales of finished inventory or preleasing requirements prior to loan funding. However, because this analysis is typically performed on a forward looking basis, real estate construction projects typically present a higher risk profile in our lending activities. Lease financing activities include commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases used to purchase items ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. Underwriting of new leasing arrangements typically includes analyzing customer cash flows, evaluating secondary sources of repayment, such as the value of the leased asset, the guarantors net cash flows as well as other credit enhancements provided by the lessee.

Table of Contents 
 Residential lending is further categorized into the following classes: residential mortgages (loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties and home equity loans) and home equity lines of credit. Our Bank s underwriting standards typically require LTV ratios of not more than 80 , although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance. First mortgage loans secured by residential properties generally carry a moderate level of credit risk, with an average loan size of approximately 393,000 at September 30, 2024. Residential mortgage loan production is added to our loan portfolio or is sold in the secondary market, based on management s evaluation of our liquidity, capital and loan portfolio mix as well as market conditions. Changes in interest rates, the economic environment and other market factors have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, the marketability and value of collateral and the financial condition of our borrowers which impacts the level of credit risk inherent in this portfolio, although we remain in a supply constrained housing environment in Hawaii. Geographic concentrations exist for this portfolio as nearly all residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are for residences located in Hawaii, Guam or Saipan. These island locales are susceptible to a wide array of potential natural disasters including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes. We offer home equity lines of credit with variable rates; fixed rate lock options may be available post-closing. All lines are underwritten at 0.95 of the credit line amount. Our procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of an applicant s overall financial capacity and repayment ability. Decisions are primarily based on repayment ability via debt-to-income ratios, LTV ratios and an evaluation of credit history. Consumer lending is further categorized into the following classes of loans: credit cards, automobile loans and other consumer-related installment loans. Consumer loans are either unsecured or secured by the borrower s personal assets. The average loan size is generally small, and risk is diversified among many borrowers. We offer a wide array of credit cards for business and personal use. In general, our customers are attracted to our credit card offerings on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs and other product features. Credit card underwriting decisions are generally based on repayment ability of our borrower via DTI ratios, credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO, and analysis of financial capacity. Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate the majority of our automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant s overall financial capacity and repayment ability, credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan or lease. Although an applicant s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured. Installment loans consist of open and closed end facilities for personal and household purchases. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in installment lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines which include an evaluation of personal credit history and cash flow. Market Risk Market risk is the potential of loss arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates. The potential cash flows, sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In the banking industry, changes in interest rates can significantly impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. Interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. This occurs when our interest earning loans and interest-bearing deposits mature or reprice at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rates may also affect loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, pre- payment speeds and other items affecting earnings. Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.

 Market Risk Measurement We primarily use net interest income simulation analysis to measure and analyze interest rate risk. We run various hypothetical interest rate scenarios and compare these results against a measured base case scenario. Our net interest income simulation analysis incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments on and off-balance sheet, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices and (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset liability management strategies to manage our interest rate risk. Table 28 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an estimate of the changes in net interest income that would result from ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (immediate changes) in market interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. Ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across the yield curve relative to the base case scenario. Shock scenarios assume an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates across the entire yield curve, relative to the base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged. We evaluate the sensitivity by using a static forecast, where the balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are held constant. 

Net Interest Income Sensitivity Profile - Estimated Percentage Change Over 12 Months Table 28 Static Forecast Static Forecast September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Gradual Change in Interest Rates (basis points) +200 2.2 3.8 +100 1.1 1.9 +50 0.6 1.0 (50) (0.6) (1.0) (100) (1.2) (2.1) Immediate Change in Interest Rates (basis points) +200 5.5 7.3 +100 2.8 3.6 +50 1.5 1.8 (50) (1.5) (2.0) (100) (3.2) (4.0) The table above shows the effects of a simulation which estimates the effect of a gradual and immediate sustained parallel shift in the yield curve of 100, 50, +50, +100 and +200 basis points in market interest rates over a twelve-month period on our net interest income. Currently, our interest rate profile, assuming a constant balance sheet, is such that we project net interest income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities. Other factors such as changes in balance sheet composition or deposit rate behavior could result in a change in repricing sensitivity. Under the static balance sheet forecast as of September 30, 2024, our net interest income sensitivity profile is slightly lower in higher interest rate scenarios compared to similar forecasts as of December 31, 2023. The sensitivity outcome described above is primarily due to the impact of changes in deposit mix from December 31, 2023. The comparisons above provide insight into the potential effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income. The Company believes that its approach to interest rate risk has appropriately considered its susceptibility to both rising and falling rates and has adopted strategies which minimize the impact of such risks.

Table of Contents 
 We also have longer term interest rate risk exposures which may not be appropriately measured by net interest income simulation analysis. We use market value of equity MVE sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. MVE involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our MVE. MVE analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario, which will impact the discounted present value. The amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing option risk in the balance sheet. Limitations of Market Risk Measures The results of our simulation analyses are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from those projected, our net interest income might vary significantly. Non parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or steepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads would also cause our net interest income to be different from that depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other short-term liabilities re-price faster than expected or faster than our assets re-price. Actual results could differ from those projected if we grow assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated if we experience a net outflow of deposits or if our mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. For example, while we maintain relatively high levels of liquidity, a faster than expected withdrawal of deposits out of the bank may cause us to seek higher cost sources of funding. Actual results could also differ from those projected if we experience substantially different prepayment speeds in our loan portfolio than those assumed in the simulation analyses. Finally, these simulation results do not consider all the actions that we may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to our loan, investment, deposit, funding or hedging strategies. Market Risk Governance We seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from changes in market interest rates. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to increase net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. To manage the impact on net interest income, we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates through our asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our ALCO and approved by our board of directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposures. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. Through review and oversight by the ALCO, we attempt to engage in strategies that neutralize interest rate risk as much as possible. Our use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in Note 11. Derivative Financial Instruments to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, has generally been limited. This is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO. We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk. Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses to formulate strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the parameters of our capital and liquidity guidelines.

 In addition, our business relied upon a large volume of loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments with attributes that were either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value. According to the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings have ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. We transitioned our financial instruments associated to LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative on December 31, 2021, to alternative reference rates (collectively, Alternative Rates ), with limited exceptions. As such, effective December 31, 2021, we have ceased the use of U.S Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate on all new contracts and continue to increase the usage of Alternative Rates such as the SOFR. A working group of key stakeholders from throughout the Company spearheaded the transition from LIBOR to Alternative Rates. There are risks inherent with the transition to any Alternative Rate as the rate may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary, market and economic events. The working group disbanded after the conclusion of the transition in December 2023. Our LIBOR transition plan included work to ensure that our technology systems were prepared for the transition, our loan documents that reference LIBOR-based rates were appropriately amended to reference other methods of interest rate determinations and internal and external stakeholders were apprised of the transition. We have implemented certain Prime Rate and SOFR conventions as we transitioned our products and transaction agreements to reference rates other than LIBOR. Commercial loans and investment securities have fully transitioned to SOFR rates. Residential mortgages with adjustable rates will fully transition off LIBOR during the fourth quarter of 2024. To see the recorded investment in our loan and lease portfolio by rate type, refer to Table 15 in the section titled Loans and Leases in this MD A. Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (such as natural disasters), or compliance, reputational or legal matters, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. Operational risk is inherent in all of our business ventures and the management of that risk is important to the achievement of our objectives. We have a framework in place that includes the reporting and assessment of any operational risk events, and the assessment of our mitigating strategies within our key business lines. This framework is implemented through our policies, processes and reporting requirements. We measure and report operational risk using the seven operational risk event types projected by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel II: (1) external fraud; (2) internal fraud; (3) employment practices and workplace safety; (4) clients, products and business practices; (5) damage to physical assets; (6) business disruption and system failures; and (7) execution, delivery and process management. Our operational risk review process is also a core part of our assessment of material new products or activities.
