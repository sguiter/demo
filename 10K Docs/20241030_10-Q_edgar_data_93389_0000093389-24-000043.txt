 Investment in Foshan GWO YNG SMP Vehicle Climate Control Cooling Products Co. Ltd. 
 In April 2014, we formed Foshan GWO YNG SMP Vehicle Climate Control Cooling Products Co. Ltd. Gwo Yng ), a / joint venture with Gwo Yng Enterprise Co., Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of air conditioner accumulators, filter driers, hose assemblies and switches. We acquired our interest in the joint venture for approximately million. In March 2018, we acquired an additional equity interest in the joint venture for Chinese yuan renminbi (approximately million), thereby increasing our equity interest in the joint venture to . While we increased our equity interest in the joint venture to , the minority shareholder maintained substantive participating rights that allowed it to participate in certain significant financial and operating decisions that occur in the ordinary course of business. As a result, we continued to account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. 
 In July 2023, we acquired an additional equity interest in the joint venture for Chinese yuan renminbi (approximately million), thereby increasing our equity interest in Gwo Yng to . In connection with the transaction, we amended and restated the charter documents of Gwo Yng to remove all minority shareholder substantive participating rights, giving SMP control of Gwo Yng. As a result, as of the closing date of the transaction, Gwo Yng was accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages a step acquisition ). Accordingly, commencing on the closing of the transaction, we reported the results of Gwo Yng on a consolidated basis with the minority ownership interest reported as a noncontrolling interest.

 As part of the Plan, we currently grant shares of restricted stock to eligible employees and our independent directors and performance-based shares to eligible employees. We grant eligible employees types of restricted stock (standard restricted shares and long-term retention restricted shares). Standard restricted shares granted to employees become fully vested no earlier than after the date of grant. Long-term retention restricted shares granted to selected executives vest at a rate on or within approximately of an executive reaching the ages 60 and 63, and become fully vested on or within approximately of an executive reaching the age 65. Restricted shares granted to directors become fully vested upon the first anniversary of the date of grant. 
 Performance-based shares issued to eligible employees are subject to a measuring period and the achievement of performance targets and, depending upon the achievement of such performance targets, they may become vested no earlier than after the date of grant. Each period we evaluate the probability of achieving the applicable targets, and we adjust our accrual accordingly. Restricted shares (other than long-term retention restricted shares) and performance shares issued to certain key executives and directors are subject to a one or holding period upon the lapse of the vesting period. Forfeitures on stock grants are estimated at for employees and for executives and directors based on our evaluation of historical and expected future turnover.

 We maintain a defined contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for key employees. Under the plan, these employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation and, in addition, we may at our discretion make contributions to the plan on behalf of the employees. In March 2024, we made company contributions to the plan of million related to calendar year 2023. 
 We also have an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust for employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In connection therewith, we maintain an employee benefits trust to which we contribute shares of treasury stock. We are authorized to instruct the trustees to distribute such shares toward the satisfaction of our future obligations under the plan. The shares held in trust are not considered outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share until they are committed to be released. The trustees will vote the shares in accordance with their fiduciary duties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we contributed to the trust an additional shares from our treasury and released shares from the trust leaving shares remaining in the trust as of September 30, 2024.

 Cash equivalents consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months, or less. These securities are accounted for as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost, which approximates their fair values. The fair value of the underlying assets held by the deferred compensation plan are based on the quoted market prices of the underlying funds which are held by registered investment companies. The carrying value of our variable rate short-term borrowings and long-term debt under our credit facilities approximates fair value as the variable interest rates in the facilities reflect current market rates. The fair value of our cash flow interest rate swap agreement is obtained from an independent third party, is based upon market quotes, and represents the net amount required to terminate the interest rate swap, taking into consideration market rates and counterparty credit risk. The fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts is based on observable market transactions of spot and forward rates. Short-term and long-term investments consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities occurring within the next twelve months or in excess of twelve months, respectively. These certificates of deposit are securities accounted 
 for as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost, which approximates their fair values at September 30, 2024.

 cases were outstanding for which we may be responsible for any related liabilities. Since inception in September 2001 through September 30, 2024, the amounts paid for settled claims and awards of asbestos-related damages, including interest, were approximately million. We do not have insurance coverage for the indemnity and defense costs associated with the claims we face. 
 In evaluating our potential asbestos-related liability, we have considered various factors including, among other things, an actuarial study of the asbestos related liabilities performed by an independent actuarial firm, our settlement amounts and whether there are any co-defendants, the jurisdiction in which lawsuits are filed, and the status and results of such claims. As is our accounting policy, we consider the advice of actuarial consultants with experience in assessing asbestos-related liabilities to estimate our potential claim liability; and perform an actuarial evaluation in the third quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. The methodology used

 million to million for the period through 2065. The change from the prior year study, which was as of August 31, 2023, was a million increase for the low end of the range and a million increase for the high end of the range. The increase in the estimated undiscounted liability from the prior year study at both the low end and high end of the range reflects our actual experience, our historical data and certain assumptions with respect to events that may occur in the future. 
 Based upon the results of the August 31, 2024 actuarial study, in September 2024 we increased our asbestos liability to million, the low end of the range, and recorded an incremental pre-tax provision of million in loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Future legal costs, which are expensed as incurred and reported in loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations, are estimated, according to the August 31, 2024 study, to range from million to million for the period through 2065. Total operating cash outflows related to discontinued operations, which include settlements, awards of asbestos-related damages and legal costs, net of taxes, were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We plan to perform an annual actuarial evaluation during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that additional provisions may be necessary. Given the uncertainties associated with projecting such matters into the future and other factors outside our control, we can give no assurance that additional provisions will not be required. We will continue to monitor events and changes in circumstances surrounding these potential liabilities in determining whether to perform additional actuarial evaluations and whether additional provisions may be necessary. At the present time, however, we do not believe that any additional provisions would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position. 
 Other Litigation 
 We are currently involved in various other legal claims and legal proceedings (some of which may involve substantial amounts), including claims related to commercial disputes, product liability, employment, and environmental. Although these legal claims and legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may at any time determine that settling any of these matters is in our best interests, which settlement may include substantial payments. Although we cannot currently predict the specific amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, we will record provisions when the liability is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability related to these matters. Such revisions of the potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Overview 
 We are a leading manufacturer and distributor of premium replacement parts in the automotive aftermarket and a custom-engineered solutions provider to vehicle and equipment manufacturers in diverse non-aftermarket end markets. Our business is organized into three operating segments. Our automotive aftermarket business is comprised of two segments, Vehicle Control and Temperature Control , while our Engineered Solutions Segment offers a broad array of conventional and future-oriented technologies. We sell our products primarily to retailers, warehouse distributors, original equipment manufacturers and original equipment service part operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Mexico and other Latin America countries. 
 Our Vehicle Control operating segment services our core automotive aftermarket customers, deriving its sales from three major product groups: (1) Ignition, Emissions Fuel Delivery , which includes the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) dependent categories; (2) Electrical Safety , which includes powertrain neutral vehicle technologies such as electrical switches/relays, safety related products such as anti-lock brake and vehicle speed sensors, tire pressure monitoring, park assist sensors, and advanced driver assistance components; and (3) Wire Sets Other , which includes spark plug wire sets and other related products, and are product categories we have noted to be in secular decline based upon product life cycle. 
 Our Temperature Control operating segment services our core automotive aftermarket customers with thermal products, and is poised to benefit from the broader adoption of air conditioning and other thermal systems. These systems will provide passenger comfort regardless of the vehicles powertrain, and are being developed to cool batteries and other products used on electric vehicles. Segment offerings include sales from thermal products in the aftermarket business under two major product groups: (1) AC System Components, which includes compressors, connecting lines, heat exchangers, and expansion devices; and 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 (2) Other Thermal Component s, which includes parts that provide engine, transmission, electric drive motor, and battery temperature management. 
 Our Engineered Solutions operating segment supplies custom-engineered solutions to vehicle and equipment manufacturers in highly diversified global end-markets such as commercial and light vehicles, construction, agriculture, power sports and marine. Segment offerings include product categories that offer a broad array of conventional and future-oriented technologies, including those that are specific to vehicle electrification as well as those that are powertrain-neutral. 
 
 Overview of Financial Performance 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 Net sales 399,265 386,413 Gross profit 121,366 114,760 Gross profit 30.4 29.7 Operating income 37,139 34,806 Operating income 9.3 9.0 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 36,123 32,917 Provision for income taxes 9,267 7,995 Earnings from continuing operations 26,856 24,922 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (22,771) (18,200) Net earnings 4,085 6,722 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest 275 63 Net earnings attributable to SMP 3,810 6,659 Per share data attributable to SMP Diluted: Earnings from continuing operations 1.20 1.12 Discontinued operations (1.03) (0.82) Net earnings per common share 0.17 0.30 
 Consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 399.3 million, an increase of 12.9 million, or 3.3 , compared to net sales of 386.4 million in the same period in 2023. Net sales increased in all our operating segments, when compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 The increase in net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year reflects the impact of multiple factors including: 
 stable demand in the automotive aftermarket business across our major product groups, 
 warmer year-over-year weather conditions increasing demand for our Temperature Control products, and 
 strong customer demand in our Engineered Solutions operating segment with growth coming from business wins as well as successful cross-selling efforts. 
 Gross margins as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.4 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 29.7 in the third quarter of 2023. The gross margin percentage in our Temperature Control and Vehicle Control segments increased year-over-year, while the gross margin percentage decreased in our Engineered Solutions segment. While all segments benefited from favorable manufacturing cost absorption due to higher production levels, the gross margin percentage increase in our Vehicle Control segment also reflects the impact of increased pricing and saving initiatives, despite lingering inflationary

 increases in material and labor costs. The gross margin percentage increase in our Temperature Control segment also results from the impact of higher sales volumes, customer mix and the impact of cost control measures. The Engineered Solutions gross margin percentage also continued to be negatively impacted by inflationary cost increases. While we anticipate continued margin pressure resulting from inflationary headwinds, we believe that our annual cost savings initiatives should help to offset this impact to our gross margins. 
 Operating margin as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 9.3 as compared to 9.0 for the same period in 2023. Included in our operating margin were selling, general and administrative expenses of 81.2 million, or 20.3 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 79.8 million, or 20.6 of net sales, for the same period in 2023. The 1.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 is principally due to (1) increased rent and incremental expenses of approximately 1.1 million as we transition away from our Edwardsville, Kansas distribution center to our new distribution facility in Shawnee, Kansas, (2) higher distribution and freight costs of 0.5 million related to higher sales, and (3) higher interest related costs of 0.3 million incurred in our supply chain financing arrangements, (4) partially offset by 1.0 million of derivative gains from forward foreign exchange contracts executed during the third quarter to economically hedge the purchase price on the pending Nissens Automotive acquisition. 
 Overall, our core automotive aftermarket business remains stable, and we continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth potential of the complementary markets served in our Engineered Solutions operating segment. 
 
 New Distribution Facility in Shawnee, Kansas 
 In May 2023, we signed a lease for a new distribution facility in Shawnee, Kansas with a lease commencement date of July 1, 2023. The new facility will expand our total distribution network square footage to meet our growing demands in the automotive aftermarket industry. The new 575,000 square foot facility will replace our current 363,000 square foot facility in Edwardsville, Kansas, and integrate state-of-the-art technologies to deliver improved logistics capabilities, operational efficiencies, as well as enhanced employee, customer and supplier experiences. The new facility is located just five miles away from our Edwardsville facility, enabling us to retain our existing workforce avoiding the additional costs of hiring and training. The facility will have a phased opening that began in 2024 and will be fully operational in early 2025. We will incur additional costs in 2024 and 2025 during the phase-in period while we operate the two facilities. 
 
 Separation Program 
 During the second quarter of 2024, as part of our commitment to optimize our cost structure and provide professional development opportunities to our employees, we offered a voluntary retirement incentive package of severance and other benefit enhancements to eligible employees in the United States and Canada. The offer period ended on June 14, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we expanded the program to include involuntary separations. We recorded expenses of 5.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, with additional expenses to be recorded of approximately 1.3 million in the remainder of 2024, 0.6 million in 2025, and 0.1 million in 2026 for an aggregate cost of approximately 7.6 million. It is anticipated that the overall separation program will reduce operating expenses for the remainder of 2024. Expenses incurred pursuant to the program are recorded in restructuring and integration expenses in our statement of operations. 
 We continue to look for opportunities to reduce our operating cost structure to remain competitive while continuing to grow our business.

 Impact of Global Supply Chain Disruption and Inflation 
 Disruptions in the global economy have impeded global supply chains, resulted in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts and raw materials, and resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. In response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary cost increases, we have taken, and continue to take, several actions to mitigate the impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts on our business, including implementing cost savings initiatives and the pass through of higher costs to our customers in the form of price increases, and maintaining inventory at levels to minimize potential disruptions from out-of-stock raw materials and components to ensure higher fill rates with our customers. We believe that we have also benefited from our geographically diversified manufacturing footprint and our strategy to bring more product manufacturing in-house, especially with respect to product availability and fill rates. We expect these inflationary trends to continue for some time, and while we believe that we will be able to somewhat offset the impact, there can be no assurances that unforeseen future events in the global supply chain affecting the availability of materials and components, and/or increasing commodity pricing, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Sustainability 
 Our Company was founded in 1919 on the values of integrity, common decency and respect for others. These values are embodied in our Code of Ethics, which has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company to serve as a statement of principles to guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business. These values also serve as the foundation for our continued focus on many important sustainability issues. 
 We have made significant strides with respect to our sustainability initiatives, building awareness of the environmental impact of our operations, and challenging ourselves to reduce our impact by reducing our usage of energy and water, reducing our generation of waste, increasing our recycling efforts and reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, we believe our product offering contributes to a greener car parc through several key product categories that are critical components in automotive systems designed to improve fuel economy and reduce harmful emissions, such as fuel injectors, exhaust gas recirculation valves, sensors and tubes, and evaporative emission control system components. We also bring to market alternative energy products, which utilize cleaner burning fuels or are designed for electric or hybrid electric vehicles, and we remanufacture key categories within our product portfolio, such as air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors and diesel pumps, through processes that save energy and reduce waste. 
 With each year, we intend to further our commitment to sustainability initiatives, improving our environmental stewardship, finding ways to give back to our communities, and enhancing the diversity and inclusion of our workforce while offering opportunities for development. Information on our sustainability initiatives can be found in our most current sustainability report and on our corporate website at ir.smpcorp.com under Sustainability and at smpcares.smpcorp.com. Information in our sustainability report and on our corporate websites regarding our sustainability initiatives are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated by reference in this Report.

 While all segments benefited from favorable manufacturing cost absorption due to higher production levels, the gross margin percentage increase in our Vehicle Control operating segment also reflects the impact of increased pricing and saving initiatives, despite lingering inflationary increases in material and labor costs. The gross margin percentage increase in our Temperature Control operating segment also results from the impact of higher sales volumes, customer mix and the impact of cost control measures. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales in our Engineered Solutions operating segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the comparable period in 2023 driven primarily by inflationary cost increases. While we anticipate continued margin pressure resulting from inflationary headwinds, we believe that our annual cost savings initiatives should help to offset much of this impact to our gross margins. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 81.2 million, or 20.3 of consolidated net sales, in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 79.8 million, or 20.6 of consolidated net sales, in the third quarter of 2023. The 1.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023 is principally due to (1) increased rent and incremental expenses of approximately 1.1 million as we transition away from our Edwardsville, Kansas distribution center to our new distribution facility in Shawnee, Kansas, (2) higher distribution and freight costs of 0.5 million related to higher sales, and (3) higher interest related costs of 0.3 million incurred in our supply chain financing arrangements, (4) partially offset by 1.0 million of derivative gains from forward foreign exchange contracts executed during the third quarter to economically hedge the purchase price on the pending Nissens Automotive acquisition.

 Restructuring and Integration Expenses. Restructuring and integration expenses were 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.2 million in the same period of 2023. Restructuring and integration expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2024 relate primarily to the Separation Program announced in the second quarter of 2024 and expanded to encompass involuntary separations in the third quarter of 2024 as part of our commitment to optimizing our cost structure and providing professional development opportunities to our employees. Expenses in the third quarter of 2024 of approximately 3.0 million related to the program consists of severance and other benefit enhancements. 
 Restructuring and integration expenses of 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 relate to the Cost Reduction Initiative announced in the fourth quarter of 2023. We anticipate that the Cost Reduction Initiative will be substantially completed by the end of 2024. 
 Operating Income. Operating income was 37.1 million , or 9.3 of consolidated net sales, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 34.8 million, or 9 of consolidated net sales, in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase in operating income of 2.3 million is primarily the result of higher net sales and gross margin percentage, offset, in part, by higher restructuring and integration expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Other Non-Operating Income, Net. Other non-operating income, net was 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase in other non-operating income, net primarily results from the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to 3.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease in interest expense reflects the impact of lower average outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the write off of 1.3 million of unamortized financing costs related to the refinancing of our 2022 Credit Agreement . 
 Income Tax Provision . The income tax provision in the third quarter of 2024 was 9.3 million at an effective tax rate of 25.7 compared to 8 million at an effective tax rate of 24.3 for the same period in 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to higher earnings and taxes in foreign jurisdictions and taxes withheld on cash repatriated from foreign jurisdictions. 
 Loss from Discontinued Operations. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 of 22.8 million and 18.2 million, respectively, reflects information contained in the actuarial studies performed as of August 31, 2024 and 2023, other information available and considered by us, and legal expenses associated with our asbestos related liability. The loss from discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 primarily consists of a 29.3 million and 23.8 million pre-tax provision, respectively, to increase our indemnity liability in line with the August 31, 2024 and 2023 actuarial studies; As discussed more fully in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (unaudited), we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products. 
 Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest relates to the minority shareholders interest in our 70 owned joint venture in Hong Kong, with operations in Shanghai and Wuxi, China Trombetta Asia, Ltd. and, in our 80 ownership in Gwo Yng, commencing in July 2023 upon the completion of our step acquisition. Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were 0.3 million and 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 While all segments benefited from favorable manufacturing cost absorption due to higher production levels, the gross margin percentage in our Vehicle Control operating segment also reflects the impact of the lingering inflationary increases in material and labor costs, which offset the positive impact of pricing and saving initiatives. The gross margin percentage increase in our Temperature Control operating segment also reflects the impact of higher sales volumes, customer mix and the impact of cost control measures. Gross margins as a percentage of net sales in our Engineered Solutions operating segment decreased in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the comparable period in 2023 driven primarily by unfavorable customer sales mix and inflationary cost increases. While we anticipate continued margin pressure resulting from inflationary headwinds, we believe that our annual cost savings initiatives should help to offset much of this impact to our gross margin. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 239.8 million , or 21.4 of consolidated net sales, in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to 223.3 million, or 20.9 of consolidated net sales in the first nine months of 2023. The 16.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as compared to the first nine months of 2023 is principally due to (1) higher distribution and freight costs of 5.9 million related to higher sales, (2) increased rent and incremental expenses of approximately 3.5 million as we transition away from our Edwardsville, Kansas distribution center to our new distribution facility in Shawnee, Kansas, (3) 3.9 million higher general and administrative largely driven by higher accrued employee bonuses, (4) 2.4 million of due diligence, legal and other professional fees related to our planned acquisition of Nissens Automotive, and (5) higher interest related costs of 2.2 million incurred in our supply chain financing arrangements, (6) partially offset by 1.0 million of derivative gains from forward foreign exchange contracts executed during the third quarter to economically hedge the purchase price on the pending Nissens Automotive acquisition. 
 Restructuring and Integration Expenses. Restructuring and integration expenses were 5.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.4 million in the comparable period of 2023. Restructuring and integration expenses incurred in the first nine months of 2024 relate primarily to the Separation Program announced in the second quarter of 2024 and expanded to encompass involuntary separations in the third quarter of 2024 as part of our commitment to optimizing our cost structure and provide professional development opportunities to our employees. Expenses in the first nine months of 2024 of approximately 5.6 million related to the program consists of severance and other benefit enhancements.

Table of Contents 

 Restructuring and integration expenses of 1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relate to the Cost Reduction Initiative announced in the fourth quarter of 2023. We anticipate that the Cost Reduction Initiative will be substantially completed by the end of 2024 . 
 Operating Income.

The year-over-year decrease in operating income of 6.0 million is primarily the result of higher selling, general and administrative expenses, and higher restructuring and integration expenses, offset, in part, by the impact of higher net sales. 
 Other Non-Operating Income, Net. Other non-operating income, net was 5.1 million in the nine months of 2024, compared to 2.8 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase in other non-operating income, net results from the increase in year-over-year equity income from our joint ventures and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Equity income from our joint ventures increased irrespective of the year-over-year decline in the equity income of Gwo Yng, reflecting the impact of our acquisition of an additional 15 equity interest in Gwo Yng in July 2023. Commencing on the date of our equity interest increase, the financial results of Gwo Yng were no longer accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Instead, Gwo Yng s financial results are reported on a consolidated basis. As such, other non-operating income, net includes equity income of Gwo Yng of 0.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to 8.0 million in the nine months of 2024, compared to 10.8 million for the same period in 2023.

 Restructuring and Integration Programs 
 For a detailed discussion on the restructuring and integration costs, see Note 4, Restructuring and Integration Expenses, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements (unaudited). 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary cash requirements include working capital, capital expenditures, regular quarterly dividends, stock repurchases, principal and interest payments on indebtedness and acquisitions. The following table summarizes our primary sources of funds including ongoing net cash flows from operating activities and availability under our Credit Agreement. 
 September 30, December 31, (In thousands) 2024 2023 2023 Operating cash flows 78,200 132,893 144,260 Total debt 142,848 147,596 156,211 Cash 26,348 28,485 32,526 Net debt 116,500 119,111 123,685 Remaining borrowing capacity (a) 287,680 343,981 334,180 Total liquidity 314,028 372,466 366,706

 Operating Activities. During the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by operating activities was 78.2 million compared to 132.9 million in the same period of 2023. 
 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the lower year-over-year decrease in inventory of 2.9 million compared to 54.3 million in the same period of 2023, the larger increase in accounts receivable of 59.0 million compared to 38.9 million in the same period of 2023 due to higher net sales, and the lower year-over-year increase in accounts payable of 4.5 million compared to 15.9 million in the same period of 2023, partially offset by a larger increase in sundry receivables and accrued expenses of 45.5 million compared to 12.3 million in the same period of 2023. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated significant operating cash flow by reducing our inventory to more normalized levels while actively managing our accounts receivable and accounts payable. We continue to actively manage our working capital to maximize our operating cash flow. 
 Investing Activities . Cash used in investing activities was 34.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 15.1 million in the same period of 2023. Investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of 34.1 million and 18.0 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase in capital expenditures primarily relates to the implementation of upgraded automation equipment, racking and other equipment, as we invest in the start-up of our new distribution facility in Shawnee, Kansas. 
 Financing Activities . Cash used in financing activities was 47.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 111 million in the same period of 2023.

 Liquidity. 
 Our primary sources of funds are ongoing net cash flows from operating activities and availability under our 2024 Credit Agreement (as detailed below). 
 In May 2024 and July 2024, the Company amended it's then-existing Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders ("2022 Credit Agreement"), to transition from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate CDOR to the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA for benchmark borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars and to provide for a new 125 million term loan and the use of funds available under the revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of Nissens Automotive and related transaction costs. For additional information on our agreement to acquire Nissens Automotive see Note 3, Business Acquisitions and Investments. 
 In September 2024, the Company refinanced its existing 2022 Credit Agreement with a new five-year Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders 2024 Credit Agreement ). The 2024 Credit Agreement matures on September 16, 2029 and provides for an approximately 750 million credit facility, comprised of a 430 million multi-currency revolving credit facility ("global tranche"); (ii) a 10 million multi-currency revolving credit facility, that will be available to one or more wholly-owned Danish subsidiaries of the Company ("Danish tranche"); (iii) a 200 million delayed draw term loan facility in U.S. dollars; and (iv) a 100 million euros delayed draw term loan facility. The revolving credit facility has a 25 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit, and a 30 million sublimit for the borrowing of swingline loans. 
 Borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement and will be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, and to finance the Company s acquisition of Nissens Automotive and related transaction costs. The term loans amortize in quarterly installments of 1.25 in each of the first two years following the funding, 1.875 for the next two years, and 2.50 in each quarter thereafter. The Company may request up to two one-year extensions of the maturity date. 
 The Company may, subject to customary conditions, increase the global tranche or obtain incremental term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed (x) the greater of (i) 168 million and (ii) 100 of consolidated EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters ended most recently before such date, plus (y) any voluntary prepayment of term loans, plus (z) any amount that, after giving effect to the increase, the pro forma First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) does not exceed 2.75 to 1.00. The Company may also, subject to customary conditions, request to increase the Danish tranche by up to 5 million. 
 Borrowings bear interest at the applicable interest rate index selected by the Company based on the particular currency borrowed plus a credit spread adjustment depending on the index, and a margin ranging from 1.25 to 2.25 per annum based on the total net leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. The Company may select interest periods of one, three or six months depending on the index. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. 
 The Company may prepay the borrowings, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.

 The Company s obligations under the 2024 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by its material domestic subsidiaries (each, a Guarantor ), and secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The collateral security described above also secures certain banking services obligations and interest rate swaps and currency or other hedging obligations of the Company owing to any of the then existing lenders or any affiliates thereof. 
 Outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024 under the credit agreements were 140 million of long-term debt and at December 31, 2023 were 156 million, consisting of current borrowings of 5 million and long-term debt of 151 million. Letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreements were 2.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate under the 2024 Credit Agreement was 5.0 , which consisted of 140 million in borrowings under Term SOFR, adjusted for the impact of the interest rate swap agreement on 100 million of borrowings. At December 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate under the 2022 Credit Agreement was 5 , which consisted of 156 million in borrowings at 5 under Term SOFR, adjusted for the impact of the interest rate swap agreement on 100 million of borrowings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average daily alternative base rate loan balance was 1 million, compared to a balance of 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a balance of 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the creation of liens, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends and other payments in respect of equity interests, acquisitions, investments, loans and guarantees, subject, in each case, to customary exceptions, thresholds and baskets. The 2024 Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. 
 In November 2023, our Polish subsidiary, SMP Poland sp. z.o.o., further amended its overdraft facility with HSBC Continental Europe (Spolka Akcyjna) Oddzial w Polsce. The overdraft facility, as amended, provides for borrowings under the facility in euros and U.S. dollars. Under the amended terms, the overdraft facility provides for borrowings of up to Polish zloty 30 million (approximately 7.5 million) if borrowings are solely in Polish zloty, or up to 85 of the Polish zloty 30 million limit (approximately 6.4 million) if borrowings are in euros and/or U.S. dollars. The overdraft facility had an original maturity date in March 2024, with automatic three-month renewals until June 2027, subject to cancellation by either party, at its sole discretion, at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the three-month renewal period. The facility automatically renewed in September 2024 to a December 2024 maturity date. Borrowings under the amended overdraft facility will bear interest at a rate equal to (1) the one month Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate WIBOR + 1.0 for borrowings in Polish zloty, (2) the one month Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR + 1.0 for borrowings in euros, and (3) the Mid-Point of the Fed Target Range + 1.25 for borrowings in U.S. dollars. Borrowings under the overdraft facility are guaranteed by Standard Motor Products, Inc., the ultimate parent company. There were 1.3 million in borrowings outstanding under the overdraft facility at September 30, 2024 no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023. 
 In order to reduce our accounts receivable balances and improve our cash flow, we are party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers trade accounts receivable to such customers financial institutions. We sell our undivided interests in certain of these receivables at our discretion when we determine that the cost of these arrangements is less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing debt. Under the terms of the agreements, we retain no rights or interest, have no obligations with respect to the sold receivables, and do not service the receivables after the sale. As such, these transactions are accounted for as a sale.

Table of Contents 

 Pursuant to these agreements, we sold 285.4 million and 686.3 million of receivables during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 260.4 million and 643 million for the comparable periods in 2023. Receivables presented at financial institutions and not yet collected as of September 30, 2024 were approximately 1.8 million and remained in our accounts receivable balance as of that date. All receivables sold were reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale. A charge in the amount of 14.9 million and 38.3 million related to the sale of receivables was included in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 14.6 million and 36.1 million for the comparable periods in 2023. 
 To the extent that these arrangements are terminated, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected by extended payment terms, or delays or failures in collecting trade accounts receivable. The utility of the supply chain financing arrangements also depends upon a benchmark reference rate for the purpose of determining the discount rate applicable to each arrangement. If the benchmark reference rate increases significantly, we may be negatively impacted as we may not be able to pass these added costs on to our customers, which could have a material and adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In July 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 30 million of our common stock under a stock repurchase program. Stock will be purchased from time to time in the open market, or through private transactions, as market conditions warrant. Under this program, there were no repurchases of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 321,229 shares of our common stock at a total cost of 10.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, there was approximately 19.6 million available for future stock purchases under the program. From the end of the third quarter through October 28, 2024, there have been no additional repurchases of our common stock under the program. 
 Material Cash Commitments 
 Material cash commitments as of September 30, 2024 consist of required cash payments to service our outstanding borrowings of 140 million under our Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, the future minimum cash requirements of 126.7 million through 2034 under operating leases, and expected future cash payments relating to our restructuring activities of 7.1 million with approximately 3.3 million paid in the remainder of 2024, approximately 3.2 million in 2025 and approximately 0.6 million thereafter. All of our other known cash commitments as of September 30, 2024 are not material. For additional information related to our material cash commitments, see Note 4, Restructuring and Integration Expenses , Note 8, Leases, and Note 9, Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (unaudited). 
 We anticipate that our cash flow from operations, available cash, and available borrowings under our Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that we will be able to mitigate the future impact, if any, of disruptions in the supply chain caused by geo-political risks, future increases in interest rates, and significant inflationary cost increases in raw materials, labor and transportation that we are unable to pass through our customers, macroeconomic uncertainty, and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements. If material adverse developments were to occur in any of these areas, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Agreement in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, if we default on any of our indebtedness, or breach any financial covenant in our Credit Agreement, our business could be adversely affected. 
 For further information regarding the risks in our business, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have identified the accounting policies and estimates surrounding the Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill, and Asbestos Litigation as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies and estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, where such policies and estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. There have been no material changes to these and other accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 You should be aware that preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We can give no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Although we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates, or in the assumptions that we use in calculating the estimates, the uncertain future effects, if any, of the disruptions in the supply chain caused by geo-political risks, future increases in interest rates, inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, and other unforeseen changes in the industry, or business, could materially impact the estimates, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a detailed discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements (unaudited). 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by management. Our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs, revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency. Similarly, we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates, which may affect the cost of our financing. It is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Exchange Rate Risk 
 We have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Polish zloty, the Hungarian forint, the Mexican peso, the Taiwan dollar, the Chinese yuan renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our monetary assets and liabilities which are subject to this exposure are immaterial, therefore, the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. This sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable 10 fluctuation in the exchange rates affecting the foreign currencies in which monetary assets and liabilities are denominated and does not take into account the incremental effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues. To reduce our potential exposure to exchange rate risk due to our planned acquisition of Nissens Automotive in euros, we executed 100 million of forward foreign exchange contracts that mature in November 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio. To reduce our market risk to changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings, and to manage a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates, we occasionally enter into interest rate swap agreements. 
 In June 2022, we entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million that is to mature in May 2029. The interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge of interest payments on 100 million of borrowings under our 2024 Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the swap agreement, we will receive monthly variable interest payments based on one month Term SOFR and will pay interest based upon a fixed rate of 2.683 per annum. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 140 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2024 Credit Agreement, of which approximately 40 million bears interest at variable rates of interest and 100 million bears interest at fixed rates, after consideration of the interest rate swap agreement entered into in June 2022. Additionally, we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short-term investments. Based upon our current level of borrowings under our facilities and our excess cash, the effect of a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate may have an approximate 0.1 million annualized negative impact on our earnings or cash flows. 
 In addition, we are party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers trade accounts receivable to such customers financial institutions. We sell our undivided interests in certain of these receivables at our discretion when we determine that the cost of these arrangements is less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing debt. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 285.4 million and 686.3 million of receivables, respectively. Depending upon the level of sales of receivables pursuant these agreements, the effect of a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the margin rate may have an approximate 2.9 million and 6.9 million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The charge related to the sale of receivables is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 Other than the aforementioned, there have been no significant changes to the information presented in Item 7A (Market Risk) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have not made any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, 
 the Company s internal control over financial reporting. We review, document and test our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. We may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. These efforts may lead to various changes in our internal control over financial reporting.
