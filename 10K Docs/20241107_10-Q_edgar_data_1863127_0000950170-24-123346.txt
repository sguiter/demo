square feet of office and lab space at 2656 State Street in Carlsbad, California, for the Company s headquarters (the Original Lease). The Original Lease commenced in May 2021 and had an original term of months, with an option to extend for additional -month periods. In March 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately square feet of additional office and laboratory space at 2676 State Street in Carlsbad, California (the Expansion Lease). The Expansion Lease commenced for accounting purposes when the Company gained access to the premises in May 2023.

The landlord completed improvements on the Expansion Lease premises, and the Company paid million of these costs prior to the Expansion Lease commencement. The Company has concluded that the landlord is the accounting owner of these improvements, and therefore this payment has been included in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. The Company is entitled to certain rent abatement for delays related to the landlord's delivery of the Expansion Lease premises to the Company. The Expansion Lease has a lease term of months, starting on the day the landlord delivered possession of the Expansion Lease premises. The Company has an option to renew the Expansion Lease for two additional -month periods. The Original Lease was also amended to have the same lease expiration as the Expansion Lease. The Company did not include the renewal periods in determining the lease term, as the Company was not reasonably certain to exercise either the amended Original Lease or the Expansion Lease renewal options. In connection with the Company's lease agreements, the Company paid security deposits of million and is required to maintain a letter of credit of million. The letter of credit may be reduced to million in 2027 and further reduced to million in 2028.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing next-generation precision medicines that target large opportunities in Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) biology. Our in-house precision medicine platform, SN P, enables rapid and precise drug design through iterative molecular SN Pshots that help predict genetic alterations most likely to cause acquired resistance to existing therapies. Our initial focus is on applying our accelerated small molecule drug discovery engine to develop therapies in targeted oncology and genetically defined conditions. 
 In oncology, the widespread availability of approved targeted treatments, such as kinase inhibitors, has transformed the cancer treatment landscape. Despite the therapeutic benefit that targeted oncology treatments have created for some patients, the response rate and duration of efficacy is often limited by acquired drug resistance, off-target toxicities and other shortcomings of existing therapies. We are using our proprietary SN P platform in order to generate novel product candidates that are specifically designed to limit off-target toxicities and address acquired drug resistance to provide next-generation treatment options. 
 Our lead product candidate, TYRA-300, is an investigational, oral, FGFR3-selective inhibitor currently being evaluated in an international, multi-center, open label Phase 1 clinical trial, SURF301 (Study in Untreated and Resistant FGFR3+ Advanced Solid Tumors). SURF301 (NCT05544552) was designed to determine the optimal and maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TYRA-300, as well as to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TYRA-300. SURF301 is currently enrolling adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and other advanced solid tumors with FGFR3 gene alterations. We expect that the Phase 1 portion of SURF301 will provide data to inform the dosing schedule of TYRA-300 we intend to evaluate in potential future studies in mUC and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). The Part A, Phase 1 portion of SURF301 has completed dose escalation without determining an MTD, and the current expansion cohorts in Part B are evaluating potentially therapeutic once daily and twice daily doses in preparation for potential future Phase 2 studies in NMIBC and 
 16 

mUC. In October 2024, we announced that we plan to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study of TYRA-300 in NMIBC by year-end 2024. 
 In October 2024, we also announced interim clinical proof-of-concept data for TYRA-300 in patients with mUC from our ongoing SURF301 Phase 1/2 study. These data were presented at a late-breaking oral presentation at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Barcelona, Spain. As of the August 15, 2024 data cutoff, 41 patients were enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the SURF301 Phase 1/2 study. Eligible participants were adults with advanced malignancies with or without FGFR3 alterations, including those with prior treatment with Erdafitinib. The enrolled patient population was heavily pre-treated, with 44 of patients receiving 3 lines of therapy prior to receiving TYRA-300, and 76 of FGFR3+ mUC patients receiving 3 lines of therapy. Treatment with TYRA-300 was evaluated across six dose levels, ranging from 10 mg-120 mg once daily (QD). Preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis in 41 patients as of the data cutoff date was as follows: TYRA-300 plasma concentrations indicate adequate target coverage at 90 mg QD, with further pharmacokinetic characterization ongoing. 
 In patients with FGFR3+ mUC who received doses 90 mg QD, anti-tumor activity was observed in all patients: (i) 6 out of 11 (54.5 patients at 90 mg QD achieved a confirmed partial response (PR), 3 of which are still ongoing; (ii) 5 out of 10 (50 patients at 90 mg QD achieved a PR; (iii) 1 out of 1 (100 patient at 120 mg QD achieved a PR; and (iv) a 100 disease control rate (DCR) was achieved for all patients at 90 mg QD (PR + stable disease). TYRA-300 has demonstrated favorable interim safety results as of the data cutoff date: (i) preliminary data from SURF301 suggest TYRA-300 to be generally well-tolerated, with infrequent FGFR2- and FGFR1-associated toxicities; (ii) in doses from 10 mg up to 120 mg QD, there were 4 (10 serious adverse events related to TYRA-300, 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade (Gr) 3 diarrhea at 90 mg QD, and 1 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) leading to discontinuation of treatment (Gr3 ALT, 90 mg QD); (iii) there were no Gr4 TRAEs; and (iv) the 120 mg QD dose was the highest dose evaluated with no DLTs reported. 
 Beyond oncology, FGFR3 is implicated in many genetically-defined conditions, such as achondroplasia (ACH) and other skeletal dysplasias, due to its role in regulating bone and cartilage formation. In March 2023, we announced we were expanding development of TYRA-300 into ACH based on positive preclinical results demonstrated in a study performed in collaboration with the Imagine Institute in Paris, France. Data from the study showed that TYRA-300 increased body length in mice by 17.9 compared to the vehicle (p 
 In October 2024, we announced that the FDA allowed the Company s IND application for TYRA-300 to proceed with a Phase 2 clinical trial of TYRA-300 for children with achondroplasia (BEACH301). BEACH301 will be a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study evaluating TYRA-300 in children ages 3 to 10 with achondroplasia with open growth plates. The study will enroll children who are treatment-na ve (Cohort 1) and those who have received prior growth-accelerating therapy (Cohort 2) at multiple sites across the globe. Each of these cohorts is expected to enroll up to 10 participants per dose level (0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.50 mg/kg) for up to 12 months. Prior to initiation of Cohorts 1 and 2, the study will enroll a safety sentinel cohort of up to 3 treatment-na ve participants per dose level in children ages 5 to 10. The primary objectives of the study will be to assess safety and tolerability in children with achondroplasia and evaluate change from baseline in annualized growth velocity to determine the dose(s) for further development. Secondary objectives will include evaluating change from baseline in height z-score, proportionality and PK. The Company is also planning exploratory assessments of clinical outcomes such as functional improvements, changes in the spine, and quality of life measures. The Company expects to dose the first child with achondroplasia in the BEACH301 study in the first quarter of 2025. In July 2023 and January 2024, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) and Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) Designation to TYRA-300, respectively, for the treatment of ACH. 
 In July 2024, we announced the expansion of development of TYRA-300 into hypochondroplasia (HCH) based on positive preclinical results. In a preclinical HCH model, TYRA-300 demonstrated increases in long bone length and binding against the HCH altered protein. HCH is a skeletal dysplasia closely related to ACH. HCH is most commonly caused by the N540K mutation (~70-80 in the FGFR3 gene. The design of TYRA-300 may inhibit the alteration driving FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasias including ACH, HCH and others. 
 Our second oncology product candidate, TYRA-200, is an investigational, oral, FGFR1/2/3 inhibitor with potency against activating FGFR2 gene alterations, as well as clinically important molecular brake and gatekeeper resistance mutations. TYRA-200 is currently being evaluated in a multi-center, open label Phase 1 clinical study, SURF201 (Study in PrevioUsly treated and Resistant FGFR2+ Cholangiocarcinoma and Other Advanced Solid Tumors) (NCT06160752) that is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
 17 

and PK of TYRA-200 and determine the optimal dose for further development and the MTD and RP2D, as well as evaluate preliminary antitumor activity. 
 We nominated our third candidate for clinical development, TYRA-430, an investigational FGFR4/3 biased inhibitor for FGF19+/FGFR4-driven cancers. In August 2024, we announced that the FDA allowed our IND to proceed with a Phase 1 clinical study of TYRA-430. The Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study of TYRA-430 in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid tumors with activating FGF/FGFR pathway aberrations (SURF431). We believe TYRA-430 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in HCC, where there are no approved biomarker-driven, targeted therapies. 
 Since the commencement of our operations in 2018, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing the company, business planning, raising capital, developing our proprietary SN P platform, undertaking research and development activities for our development programs, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, and providing general and administrative support for our operations. We have not generated any revenue to date and have funded our operations primarily from our initial public offering (IPO), private placements of our convertible preferred stock, and the issuance of Simple Agreements for Future Equity. Our net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 60.9 million and 46.3 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 225.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 360.1 million. 
 In February 2024, we completed a private placement of 9,286,023 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,087,230 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 200 million (the 2024 Private Placement) before deducting offering expenses of 0.4 million. 
 We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical development activities, other research and development activities and capital expenditures. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future particularly if and as we conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials, continue our research and development activities, utilize third parties to manufacture our product candidates and related raw materials, hire additional personnel, expand and protect our intellectual property, and incur additional costs associated with being a public company. 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures through at least 2026. We have never generated any revenue and do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, which will not be for several years, if ever. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or enter into such arrangements when needed, we could be forced to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 To date, our research and development expenses consist primarily of external and internal costs related to the development of our SN P platform and our product candidates and development programs. Our research and development expenses primarily include: 
 external costs, including: 

expenses incurred in connection with conducting clinical trials, including investigator grants and site payments for time and pass-through expenses and expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (CROs), central laboratories and other vendors and service providers engaged to conduct our trials; 

18 

expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and CROs; 

costs associated with consultants for chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) development, and other services; 

the cost of manufacturing compounds for use in our preclinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and third-party manufacturers; and 

costs related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements; and 

internal costs, including: 

employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits, travel and share-based compensation expenses for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials; and 

facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, and supplies. 

We expense research and development expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. External expenses are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. We track external expenses on a development program and other program specific basis. However, we do not track internal costs on a program specific basis because these costs primarily relate to compensation, early research and consumable costs, which are deployed across multiple programs under development. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. There are numerous factors associated with the successful development of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. In addition, future regulatory factors beyond our control may impact our clinical development programs. Product candidates in later stages of development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially over the next several years as we advance our product candidates through preclinical studies into and through clinical trials, continue to discover and develop additional product candidates and expand our pipeline, maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, and hire additional personnel. 
 Our future research and development expenses may vary significantly based on a wide variety of factors such as: 
 the number and scope, rate of progress, expense and results of our discovery and preclinical development activities and clinical trials; 

the number of trials required for approval; 

the number of sites included in each of our trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; 

the number of patients that participate in the trials; 

the ability to identify appropriate patients eligible for our clinical trials; 

the number of doses that patients receive; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; 

potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies; 

19 

the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; 

the phase of development of the product candidate; 

the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate; 

the timing, receipt, and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities including the FDA and non-U.S. regulators; 

maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates following approval, if any; 

the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates; 

significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the ability to attract and retain personnel; 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of the third parties with whom we work; 

geopolitical instability, such as the war and other conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; 

adverse effects on the financial markets, the global economy, the supply chain and our expenses due to pandemic or epidemic diseases, geopolitical instability, inflation, interest rates and other factors; and 

the extent to which we establish additional strategic collaborations or other arrangements. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. 
 The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates or any future candidates may be affected by a variety of factors. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or any future candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including employee salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation charges, for personnel in executive and administrative functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, tax and consulting services and insurance costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future to support our increased research and development activities, manufacturing activities, and the increased costs associated with operating as a public company. These increased costs will likely include increased expenses related to hiring of additional personnel, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 On September 17, 2021, we completed our IPO and issued 12,420,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately 181.2 million. Prior to our IPO, we funded our operations primarily through private placements of our convertible preferred stock with net proceeds of 157.2 million excluding issuance costs of 0.4 million. 
 On February 6, 2024, we completed the 2024 Private Placement for gross proceeds of approximately 200 million, before deducting offering expenses of 0.4 million. On March 19, 2024, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 registering the resale of the shares of common stock and shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of pre-funded warrants issued in the private placement, which registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 22, 2024. 
 Our primary uses of cash to date have been to fund our research and development activities, including with respect to TYRA-300, TYRA-300 ACH, TYRA430 and TYRA-200 and other research programs, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, hiring personnel, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 On October 3, 2022, we entered into an ATM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement) with Virtu Americas LLC (the Agent), under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 150.0 million in at the market offerings through the Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the Agent. The Agent will receive a commission from us of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sales Agreement. 
 We are not obligated to sell, and the Agent is not obligated to buy or sell, any shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement. No assurance can be given that we will sell any shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement, or, if we do, as to the price or amount of shares of common stock that we may sell or the dates when such sales will take place. As of September 30, 2024, we have not sold any shares under the Sales Agreement.

 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 1.2 million, related to proceeds from issuances of common stock under benefit plans. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures through at least 2026. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of conducting preclinical studies and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these studies and trials is uncertain. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the initiation, type, number, scope, results, costs and timing of, our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials of existing product candidates or clinical trials of other potential product candidates we may choose to pursue in the future, including based on feedback received from regulatory authorities; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing for current or future product candidates, including commercial scale manufacturing if any product candidate is approved; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of current or future product candidates; 

the costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our business grows, including additional executive officers and clinical development personnel, as well as retaining personnel; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any current or future product candidate is approved; 

our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire; and 

delays or issues with any of the above, including that the risk of each may be exacerbated by any future pandemics or epidemic diseases, potential geopolitical instability and war, inflation or rising interest rates. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise 
 24 

additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidates ourselves.

 Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

 9. 	 Golden Parachute Excise Tax . 
 (a) 	 Best Pay . Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any payment or benefit Executive would receive from the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise Payment would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment will be equal to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). The Reduced Amount will be either (A) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment (after reduction) being subject to the Excise Tax or (B) the entire Payment, whichever amount after taking into account all applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from a deduction of such state and local taxes), results in Executive s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in a Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is determined pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the Reduction Method that results in the greatest economic benefit for Executive. If more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be reduced pro rata (the Pro Rata Reduction Method ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Reduction Method or the Pro Rata Reduction Method would result in any portion of the Payment being subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A (as defined below) that would not otherwise be subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A, then the Reduction Method and/or the Pro Rata Reduction Method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to avoid the imposition of taxes pursuant to Section 409A as follows: (1) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to the greatest extent possible, the greatest economic benefit for Executive as determined on an after-tax basis; (2) as a second priority, Payments that are contingent on future events e.g ., being terminated without cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not contingent on future events; and (3) as a third priority, 
 7 | 

Payments that are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A. 
 (b) 	 Accounting Firm . All determinations regarding the application of this Section 9 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). The Company will bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by the 280G Firm required to be made hereunder. The 280G Firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder will provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company within thirty (30) days before the consummation of a Change in Control (if requested at that time by the Company) or such other time as requested by the Company. If the 280G Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it will furnish the Company with documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment. Any good faith determinations of the 280G Firm made hereunder will be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 
 10. 	 Section 409A . 
 (a) 	 General . The intent of the Parties is that the payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date, Section 409A and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. If Executive notifies the Company that Executive has received advice of tax counsel of a national reputation with expertise in Section 409A that any provision of this Agreement would cause Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Section 409A (with specificity as to the reason therefor) or the Company independently makes such determination, the Company and Executive shall take commercially reasonable efforts to reform such provision to try to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A through good faith modifications to the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with Section 409A, provided that any such modifications shall not increase the cost or liability to the Company. To the extent that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A, such modification shall be made in good faith and shall, to the maximum extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and economic benefit to Executive and the Company of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A. 
 (b) 	 Separation from Service . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) no amount that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be payable pursuant to Section 6(c) above unless the termination of Executive s employment constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Department of Treasury Regulations Separation from Service ); (ii) for purposes of Section 409A, Executive s right to receive installment payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments; and (iii) to the extent that any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A, such reimbursement or benefit shall be provided no later than December 31st of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of expenses reimbursed in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement in any subsequent year. The amount of any in-kind benefits provided in one year shall not affect the amount of in-kind benefits provided in any other year. 
 (c) 	 Specified Employee . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executive s Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A, such portion of Executive s benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of Executive s Separation from Service with the Company or (ii) the date of Executive s death. Upon the first business day following the expiration of the applicable Section 409A period, all payments deferred pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive (or Executive s estate or beneficiaries), and any remaining payments due to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein.

The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement any federal, state, local, or foreign withholding or other taxes or charges which the Company is required to withhold.

None of Executive s rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred by Executive, other than Executive s rights to payments hereunder, which may be transferred only by will, operation of law, or as otherwise provided herein. 
 (c) 	 Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed, construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with its express terms, and otherwise in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction, and where applicable, the laws of the United States, that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 (e) 	 Amendments; Waivers . This Agreement may not be modified, amended, or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by Executive and a duly authorized representative of the Company. By an instrument in writing similarly executed, Executive or a duly authorized officer of the Company, as applicable, may waive compliance by the other Party with any specifically identified provision of this Agreement that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform; provided , however , that such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other or subsequent failure.

 (f) 	 Dispute Resolution . Unless otherwise prohibited by law or specified below, all disputes, claims and causes of action, in law or equity, arising from or relating to this Agreement or its enforcement, performance, breach, or interpretation, including any dispute regarding the existence of Cause or Good Reason for Executive s termination of employment, shall be resolved solely and exclusively by final and binding arbitration held in San Diego, California, before a single, mutually-agreed neutral arbitrator, through Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services JAMS under the then existing JAMS arbitration rules.

Seeking any such relief shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such Party s right to compel arbitration. In resolving any matter submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator will strictly follow the substantive law applicable to the dispute, claim or controversy and the arbitrator s authority and jurisdiction will be limited to determining the dispute in conformity with applicable law as to liability, damages and remedies, to the same extent as if the dispute was determined by a court without a jury. The arbitrator will issue a written decision that contains the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the decision is based, which may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Company shall pay all costs of arbitration, including without limitation, arbitration administrative fees, arbitrator compensation and expenses, and costs of any witnesses called by the arbitrator. Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator under applicable law, the Company and Executive shall each bear its or his own expenses, such as attorneys fees, costs and disbursements.

Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically as part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid, and enforceable. 
 (h) 	 Entire Agreement . The terms of this Agreement and the other agreements referenced herein, including the Proprietary Information Agreement, are intended by the Parties to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the employment of Executive by the Company and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, regarding Executive s employment with the Company, including the Prior Agreement. The Parties further intend that this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any judicial, administrative, or other legal proceeding to vary the terms of this Agreement. 
 (i) 	 Executive Acknowledgement . Executive acknowledges that Executive has read and understands this Agreement, is fully aware of its legal effect, has not acted in reliance upon any representations or promises made by the Company other than those contained in writing herein, and has entered into this Agreement freely based on Executive s own judgment.

8 	 	 

(e) Other Protections .

In addition, Executive acknowledges receipt of the following notice of immunity rights under the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act, which states: (1) An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; and (2) an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose a trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and (B) does not disclose a trade secret, except pursuant to court order. 

9. Golden Parachute Excise Tax . 

(a) Best Pay . Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any payment or benefit Executive would receive from the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise Payment would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment will be equal to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). The Reduced Amount will be either (i) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment (after reduction) being subject to the Excise Tax or (ii) the entire Payment, whichever amount after taking into account all applicable federal, state, and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from a deduction of such state and local taxes), results in Executive s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in a Payment is required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the Reduced Amount is determined pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the Reduction Method that results in the greatest economic benefit for Executive. If more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be reduced pro rata (the Pro Rata Reduction 

9 	 	 

Method ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Reduction Method or the Pro Rata Reduction Method would result in any portion of the Payment being subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A (as defined below) that would not otherwise be subject to taxes pursuant to Section 409A, then the Reduction Method and/or the Pro Rata Reduction Method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to avoid the imposition of taxes pursuant to Section 409A as follows: (A) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to the greatest extent possible, the greatest economic benefit for Executive as determined on an after-tax basis; (B) as a second priority, Payments that are contingent on future events e.g ., being terminated without cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not contingent on future events; and (C) as a third priority, Payments that are deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be reduced (or eliminated) before Payments that are not deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A. 

(b) Accounting Firm . All determinations regarding the application of this Section 9 shall be made by an independent accounting firm or consulting group with nationally recognized standing and substantial expertise and experience in performing calculations regarding the applicability of Section 280G of the Code and the Excise Tax retained by the Company prior to the date of the applicable change in ownership or control (the 280G Firm ). The Company will bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by the 280G Firm required to be made hereunder. The 280G Firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder will provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Company within thirty days before the consummation of a Change in Control (if requested at that time by the Company) or such other time as requested by the Company. If the 280G Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable with respect to a Payment, either before or after the application of the Reduced Amount, it will furnish the Company with documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Payment. Any good faith determinations of the 280G Firm made hereunder will be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company and Executive. 

10. Section 409A . 

(a) General . The intent of the Parties is that the payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date, Section 409A and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. If Executive notifies the Company that Executive has received advice of tax counsel of a national reputation with expertise in Section 409A that any provision of this Agreement would cause Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Section 409A (with specificity as to the reason therefor) or the Company independently makes such determination, the Company and Executive shall take commercially reasonable efforts to reform such provision to try to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A through good faith modifications to the minimum extent reasonably appropriate to conform with Section 409A, provided that any such modifications shall not increase the cost or liability to the Company. To 

10 	 	 

the extent that any provision hereof is modified in order to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A, such modification shall be made in good faith and shall, to the maximum extent reasonably possible, maintain the original intent and economic benefit to Executive and the Company of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A. 

(b) Separation from Service . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) no amount that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A shall be payable pursuant to Section 6(c) or Section 6(d) above unless the termination of Executive s employment constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Department of Treasury Regulations Separation from Service ); (ii) for purposes of Section 409A, Executive s right to receive installment payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments; and (iii) to the extent that any reimbursement of expenses or in-kind benefits constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A, such reimbursement or benefit shall be provided no later than December 31st of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of expenses reimbursed in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement in any subsequent year. The amount of any in-kind benefits provided in one year shall not affect the amount of in-kind benefits provided in any other year. 

(c) Specified Employee . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executive s Separation from Service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A, such portion of Executive s benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executive s Separation from Service with the Company or (ii) the date of Executive s death. Upon the first business day following the expiration of the applicable Section 409A period, all payments deferred pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive (or Executive s estate or beneficiaries), and any remaining payments due to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein. 

11. Withholding . The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement any federal, state, local, or foreign withholding or other taxes or charges which the Company is required to withhold. The Company shall be entitled to rely on an opinion of counsel if any questions as to the amount or requirement of withholding shall arise. 

12. Miscellaneous Provisions . 

(a) Prior Employment . Executive represents and warrants that Executive s acceptance of employment with the Company has not breached, and the performance of Executive s duties hereunder will not breach, any duty owed by Executive to any prior employer or other person. Executive further represents and warrants to the Company that: (i) the performance of Executive s obligations hereunder will not violate any agreement between Executive and any other person, firm, organization, or other entity; (ii) Executive is not bound by 

11 	 	 

the terms of any agreement with any previous employer or other party to refrain from competing, directly or indirectly, with the business of such previous employer or other party that would be violated by Executive entering into this Agreement and/or providing services to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) Executive s performance of Executive s duties under this Agreement will not require Executive to, and Executive shall not, rely on in the performance of Executive s duties or disclose to the Company or any other person or entity or induce the Company in any way to use or rely on any trade secret or other confidential or proprietary information or material belonging to any previous employer of Executive. 

(b) Assignment and Successors . The Company shall assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all of the business or the assets of the Company (by merger or otherwise). This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, Executive, and their respective successors, assigns, personnel, and legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees, as applicable. None of Executive s rights or obligations may be assigned or transferred by Executive, other than Executive s rights to payments hereunder, which may be transferred only by will, operation of law, or as otherwise provided herein. 

(c) Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed, construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with its express terms, and otherwise in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction, and where applicable, the laws of the United States, that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. 

(d) Validity . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 

(e) Amendments; Waivers . This Agreement may not be modified, amended, or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by Executive and a duly authorized representative of the Company. By an instrument in writing similarly executed, Executive or a duly authorized officer of the Company, as applicable, may waive compliance by the other Party with any specifically identified provision of this Agreement that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform; provided , however , that such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other or subsequent failure. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, remedy, or power hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise of any other right, remedy, or power provided herein or by law or in equity. 

(f) Dispute Resolution . Unless otherwise prohibited by law or specified below, all disputes, claims and causes of action, in law or equity, arising from or relating to this Agreement or its enforcement, performance, breach, or interpretation, including any dispute regarding the existence of Cause or Good Reason for Executive s termination of employment, shall be resolved solely and exclusively by final and binding arbitration held in Los Angeles, California, before a 

12 	 	 

single, mutually-agreed neutral arbitrator, through Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services JAMS under the then existing JAMS arbitration rules. The rules may be found online at www.jamsadr.com or upon written request to the Company. This Section 12(f) is intended to be the exclusive method for resolving any and all claims by the Parties against each other relating to Executive s employment; provided that Executive will retain the right to file administrative charges with or seek relief through any government agency of competent jurisdiction, and to participate in any government investigation, including but not limited to (i) claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance or unemployment insurance; (ii) claims for unpaid wages or waiting time penalties brought before the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement provided that any appeal from an award or from denial of an award of wages and/or waiting time penalties shall be arbitrated pursuant to the terms of this paragraph); and (iii) claims for administrative relief from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and/or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (or any similar agency in any applicable jurisdiction other than California); provided , further , that, except as otherwise provided by law, Executive will not be entitled to obtain any monetary relief through such agencies other than workers compensation benefits or unemployment insurance benefits. Further, nothing in this Section 12(f) is intended to prevent either Party from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration, including without limitation injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure 1281.8 or any similar statute of an applicable jurisdiction. Seeking any such relief shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such Party s right to compel arbitration. In resolving any matter submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator will strictly follow the substantive law applicable to the dispute, claim or controversy and the arbitrator s authority and jurisdiction will be limited to determining the dispute in conformity with applicable law as to liability, damages and remedies, to the same extent as if the dispute was determined by a court without a jury. The arbitrator will issue a written decision that contains the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the decision is based, which may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Company shall pay all costs of arbitration, including without limitation, arbitration administrative fees, arbitrator compensation and expenses, and costs of any witnesses called by the arbitrator. Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator under applicable law, the Company and Executive shall each bear its or his own expenses, such as attorneys fees, costs and disbursements. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other dispute between the Parties will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs, in addition to any other relief. Each Party warrants that it has had the opportunity to be represented by counsel in the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, including the attorneys fees provision herein. Both Executive and the Company expressly waive his and its right to a jury trial. Executive furthers waives his right to pursue claims against the Company on a class basis; provided , however , that Executive does not waive his right, to the extent preserved by law, to pursue representative claims against the Company under the California Private Attorney General Act. 

(g) Enforcement . If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under present or future laws, such provision shall be fully severable; this 

13 	 	 

Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never comprised a portion of this Agreement; and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically as part of this Agreement a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid, and enforceable. 

(h) Entire Agreement . The terms of this Agreement and the other agreements referenced herein, including the Proprietary Information Agreement, are intended by the Parties to be the final expression of their agreement with respect to the employment of Executive by the Company and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, regarding Executive s employment with the Company. The Parties further intend that this Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive statement of their terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may be introduced in any judicial, administrative, or other legal proceeding to vary the terms of this Agreement. 

(i) Executive Acknowledgement . Executive acknowledges that Executive has read and understands this Agreement, is fully aware of its legal effect, has not acted in reliance upon any representations or promises made by the Company other than those contained in writing herein, and has entered into this Agreement freely based on Executive s own judgment. 

(j) Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same Agreement. Signatures delivered by facsimile shall be deemed effective for all purposes. 

(k) Notices . All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified; (ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and if not, then on the next business day; (iii) five days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) one day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of receipt.
