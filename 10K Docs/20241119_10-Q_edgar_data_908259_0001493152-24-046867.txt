Principles
of Consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Oncotelic, its wholly owned subsidiaries, Oncotelic Inc. and PointR, and Edgepoint
our non-controlled interest entity. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Basis
of Presentation 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission including Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
has incurred net accumulated losses of approximately million since inception of Oncotelic Inc., as the Company s historical
financial statements before the Merger have been replaced with the historical financial statements of Oncotelic Inc. The Company also
has a negative working capital of approximately million at September 30, 2024, of which approximately million contingent liability
of issuance of common shares of the Company to PointR shareholders upon achievement of certain milestones in accordance with the PointR
Merger Agreement. The Company has negative cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 
million. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one
year from the date of this filing Management expects to incur significantly lower costs and losses in the foreseeable future, as a majority
of the costs related with the development of OT-101 will be incurred by the JV, but the Company also recognizes the need to raise capital
to remain viable. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s long-term plans include continued development of its current pipeline of products, in addition to continue the development
of OT-101 which is exclusively out-licensed to the JV and the JV will be responsible for the funding required to support the development
in entirety, to generate sufficient revenues, through either technology transfer or product sales, or raise additional financing to cover
its anticipated expenses. Until the Company is able to generate sufficient revenues from its current pipeline, the Company plans on funding
its operations through the sale of equity and/or the issuance of debt, combined with or without warrants or other equity instruments. 

The
Company obtained short terms loans of approximately million from Autotelic Inc., a related party, during the nine months ended September
30, 2024. In addition, the Company obtained a short-term loan of thousand from Amit Shah, it s CFO during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. 

Although
no assurances can be given as to the Company s ability to deliver on its revenue plans, or that unforeseen expenses may arise,
management believes that the potential equity and debt financing or other potential financing will provide the necessary funding for
the Company to continue as a going concern. Also, management cannot guarantee any potential debt or equity financing will be available
on favorable terms or at all. As such, management does not believe the Company has sufficient cash for 12 months from the date of this
report. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, the Company will need to curtail operations, or cease operations
completely.

 Change in fair value 

Balance at September 30, 2024 and December
 31, 2023 

As
of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company estimated the fair value of the conversion feature derivatives embedded in
the convertible debentures based on assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model. The key valuation assumptions used consists,
in part, of the price of the Company s Common Stock, a risk-free interest rate based on the yield of a Treasury note and expected
volatility of the Company s Common Stock all as of the measurement dates. The Company used the following assumptions to estimate
fair value of the derivatives as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively: 

- 
 
 - 
 
 Market price of share 
 
 - 
 
 - 
 
 Life of instrument in years 

Volatility 
 
 - 
 - 
 
 Dividend yield 

When
the Company changes its valuation inputs for measuring financial liabilities at fair value, either due to changes in current market conditions
or other factors, it may need to transfer those liabilities to another level in the hierarchy based on the new inputs used. The Company
recognizes these transfers at the end of the reporting period that the transfers occur. For the periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively, there were no transfers of financial assets or financial liabilities between the hierarchy levels. 

The
 of contingent consideration, of shares issuable to PointR shareholders which was recorded and associated with the PointR Merger,
is also classified as Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company initially recorded the contingency based on a valuation conducted
by a third-party valuation expert. The valuation was based on a probability of the completion of certain milestones by PointR for the
shareholders to earn additional shares. The Company evaluated the probability of the earning of the milestones and concluded that the
probability of achievement of the milestones had not changed, primarily due to the shifting of focus by the Company to develop AI technologies
for the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other AI technologies. As such, the Company did not record any change to the valuation during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023, respectively. 

For
warrants issued in connection with fund raising activities, the Company estimates the grant date fair value of each warrant using the
Black-Scholes pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to
the expected term of the warrant, the expected volatility of the Common Stock consistent with the expected life of the warrant, risk-free
interest rates and expected dividend yields of the Common Stock. If the warrants are issued upon termination or cancellation of prior
issued warrants, then the Company estimates the grant date fair value of the new warrants using the Black-Scholes pricing model and evaluates
whether the new warrants are deemed as equity instruments or liability instruments. If the warrants are deemed to be equity instruments,
the Company records stock compensation expense and an addition to additional paid in capital. If, however, the warrants are deemed to
be liability instruments, then the fair value is treated as a deemed dividend and credited to additional paid in capital.

and , respectively. The VIE s net assets were less than million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

When
we sell or contribute properties to unconsolidated arrangements and retain a non-controlling ownership interest in such assets, we recognize
the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the asset sold or contributed when its derecognition criteria
are met. The equity method investment we retain in such partial sale transactions is noncash consideration and is measured at fair value.
As a result, the accounting for a partial sale will result in the recognition of a full gain or loss. 

When
circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is
other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at
fair value. 

The
Company elected the fair value option under the fair value option Subsection of Section 825-10-15 to account for its equity-method investment
as the Company believes that the fair value option is most appropriate for a company in the biotechnology industry, The fair value option
is more appropriate for companies that are involved in extensive and usually very expensive research and development efforts, which are
not appropriately reflected in the market value or reflective of the true value of the development activities of the company.

million. Upon the non-financial sale of our asset as contribution to our
equity method investment, we derecognized the balance of the carrying value of our goodwill of approximately million from the Oncotelic
Merger in accordance with our policy and authoritative accounting guidance. 

Further,
we added goodwill of upon the completion of the Merger with PointR. 

We
have one operating segment and reporting unit. Accordingly, our review of goodwill impairment indicators was performed at the entity-wide
level. In performing our annual impairment assessment, we determined if we should qualitatively assess whether it was more likely than
not the fair value of goodwill was less than its carrying amount (the qualitative impairment test). The factors we considered in the
assessment included our market capitalization, general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market and whether
there had been sustained declines in our share price. If we concluded, it was more likely than not, the fair value of the reporting unit
was less than its carrying amount, or elected not to use the qualitative impairment test, a quantitative impairment test would be performed. 

We
used our market capitalization as an indicator of fair value. While we believe the fair value measurement need not be based solely on
the quoted market price of an individual share of our Common Stock, and that we also could consider the impact of a control premium in
measuring the fair value of its reporting unit. In the absence of any other valuation metrics, the Company believed using a control premium
utilized would not be appropriate under the current circumstances. We also considered some other market comparables trends in
our stock price as well as the industry over a period of two successive quarters and prospective quarter to evaluate whether the fair
value of our reporting unit was greater than our carrying amount. As such, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill
for our single reporting unit at the end of 2023, due to a sustained decline in our market capitalization and an increase in negative
economic outlook for biotech markets We estimated and reconciled the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing our market capitalization
based on the stock price of our Common Stock as of December 31, 2023. Before completing our goodwill impairment test, we first tested
our indefinite-lived intangible asset then our remaining long-lived assets for impairment. We concluded our indefinite-lived intangible
assets were not impaired. Based on the market capitalization, we further concluded the fair value of our single reporting unit was less
than its carrying value and therefore recognized an impairment charge of million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The calculation
of the impairment charge included substantial fact-based determinations and estimates. The Company evaluated if it needed to record any
additional goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2024, based solely on the market capitalization of the Company and concluded that
an additional impairment of approximately million was required to be recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Less: Goodwill impairment

Balance at September 30, 2024 and December

In
general, the goodwill is tested on an annual impairment date of December 31, unless we observe any further deterioration in our market
capitalization in any interim periods, in which case we may, depending on the materiality of the impairment, record an impairment at
the end of other reporting periods, as we did during the course of the year ended December 31, 2023.

Company
Overview 

We
are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our goal is to advance our drug candidates
into late-stage pivotal clinical trials and either sell marketing rights to a larger pharmaceutical company or seek FDA approval ourselves. 

The
Company is currently developing OT-101, through its joint venture JV with Dragon Overseas Capital Limited Dragon and GMP Biotechnology Limited GMP Bio ), both affiliates of Golden Mountain Partners GMP ),
for various cancers and COVID-19, Artemisinin for COVID-19 and AI technologies for manufacturing, COVID-19 and other AI technologies.
The Company is also independently planning to develop OT-101 for certain animal health indications and contemplating using crypto currencies
for that platform. The Company has acquired apomorphine for Parkinson s Disease, erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.
In addition, the Company is evaluating the further development of its product candidates OXi4503 as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia
and myelodysplastic syndromes and CA4P in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. 

In
2020, the Company had entered into an agreement and supplemental agreement with GMP for a total of 1.2 million to render services for
the development of OT-101 for COVID-19 and such amount was recorded as revenue upon completion of all performance obligations under the
agreement. The Company secured various financings from GMP between 2020 and early 2022. For information on the GMP financings, please
refer to GMP Note purchase agreements and unsecured notes below. 

For
more information on the GMP debt financing and the JV, refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the unaudited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In
November 2022, the Company formed a Decentralized autonomous organization DAO entity, Pet2DAO, Inc. Pet2DAO ),
as a wholly owned subsidiary. For more information on Pet2DAO, refer to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April
12, 2024. 

Since
April 2019, we have been operating under significant capital constraints, which has curtailed our ability to achieve meaningful progress
in either of the Company s two clinical programs one of which is developing OXi4503 as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia
and myelodysplastic syndromes and the other of which is developing CA4P in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment
of advanced metastatic melanoma. We believe that the merger of Oncotelic and Oncotelic Inc. creates a combined company that has potential
to generate shareholder value through a promising pipeline of next generation immunotherapies targeting several significant cancer markets
where there is a lack of therapeutic options and lack of an effective immunotherapy protocol.

Forever
Prosperity (previously GMP) Note purchase agreements and unsecured notes

with the US FDA, and other regulatory bodies outside of the United States, moving into clinical programs with the ultimate goal of commercializing
the products, assuming a successful outcome for the products. While the Company believes that its expectations are reasonable and that
the product development for the nanomedicine platform by GMP Bio will be successful, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels
of activity, success of the development or clinical trials, future performance or the ultimate success of GMP Bio endeavors related
to the success of its efforts ultimately, resulting in any change in valuation for the Company on account of its ownership in GMP Bio.

December 2023, the Company received 50,000 from the company s CEO. As such, 50,000 was outstanding to the Company s CEO
at September 30, 2024. 

Equity
Purchase Agreement 

In
May 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the EPL and Registration Rights Agreement (the
 Registration Rights Agreement with Peak One Opportunity Fund, L.P. Peak One ), pursuant to
which the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct Peak One to purchase up to 10.0 million (the Maximum
Commitment Amount in shares of the common stock, par value 0.01 per share Common Stock in multiple
tranches. The Company filed a post-effective amendment for the EPL on April 12, 2024 with the SEC and the SEC has made the post-effective
amendment effective on April 22, 2024. The Company filed a prospectus under rule 424b3 with the SEC on April 26, 2024. For more information
on the EPL, refer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mosaic
ImmunoEngineering, Inc. Term Sheet 

In
April 2024, the Company entered into a binding term sheet (the Term Sheet with Mosaic ImmunoEngineering, Inc. Mosaic ).
For more information on the Term Sheet, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024. In August 2024,
Mosaic and the Company mutually agreed to extend the date of the Term Sheet to expire at the earlier of (1) the signing of definitive
agreements or (2) December 31, 2024. This was to allow for both Companies to complete due diligence as well as agree and finalize the
definitive agreements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expense during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time we make such
estimates. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We periodically review our
estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in
the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described
in Note 2 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

We
define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about
matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial
statements that require significant estimates and judgments are the following: 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

The
Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing
the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount. If the operation is determined
to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then these assets are written down first, followed by other long-lived assets
of the operation to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature
of the assets. 

Intangible
Assets 

The
Company records its intangible assets at cost in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The Company reviews
the intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not
that they are impaired. These events could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, a decline in operating
performance, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors. 

41 

Goodwill 

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired business over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least once annually, at the reporting unit level or more frequently if events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is applied by performing a qualitative
assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit. If, on the basis of qualitative factors, it is considered not more
likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, further testing of goodwill for impairment
would not be required. Otherwise, goodwill impairment is tested using a two-step approach. 

The
first step involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
determined to be greater than its carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the reporting unit s carrying amount is determined
to be greater than the fair value, the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. The second step involves
calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill,
of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one. The implied fair value of the goodwill in
this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of
the goodwill, an impairment loss equivalent to the difference is recorded. 

Convertible
Instruments 

The
Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives
and Hedging . 

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and
account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic
characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and
risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported
in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered
a derivative instrument. Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional
as defined under professional standards. 

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from
their host instruments) in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Accordingly,
the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments
based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the
effective conversion price embedded in the note. Original issue discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the
related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of
conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the
commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. 

ASC
815-40 Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity provides that, among other things, generally,
if an event is not within the entity s control could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an
asset or a liability. 

Derivative
Financial Instruments Indexed to the Company s Common Stock 

We
have generally issued derivative financial instruments, such as warrants, in connection with our equity offerings. We evaluate the terms
of these derivative financial instruments in order to determine their accounting treatment in our financial statements. Key considerations
include whether the financial instruments are freestanding and whether they contain conditional obligations. If the warrants are freestanding,
do not contain conditional obligations and meet other classification criteria, we account for the warrants as an equity instrument. However,
if the warrants contain conditional obligations, then we account for the warrants as a liability until the conditional obligations are
met or are no longer relevant. Because no established market prices exist for the warrants that we issue in connection with our equity
offerings, we must estimate the fair value of the warrants, which is as inherently subjective as it is for stock options, and for similar
reasons as noted in the stock-based compensation section above. For financial instruments which are accounted for as a liability, we
report any changes in their estimated fair values as gains or losses in our Consolidated Statement of Income. 

42 

Variable
Interest Entity (VIE) Accounting 

We
evaluate our ownership, contractual relationships and other interests in entities to determine the nature and extent of the interests,
whether such interests are variable interests and whether the entities are VIEs in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidations. These evaluations
can be complex and involve Management judgment as well as the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical information,
among other factors. Based on these evaluations, if the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the entity is
consolidated into the financial statements. 

Investments
- Equity Method 

The
Company accounts for equity method investments at cost, adjusted for the Company s share of the investee s earnings or losses,
which are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company periodically reviews the investments for other than temporary
declines in fair value below cost and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
asset may not be recoverable. 

The
Investment in GMP Bio represents the investment into equity securities for which the Company elected the fair value option pursuant to
ASC 825-10-15 and subsequent fair value changes in the GMP Bio shares are included in the result from continuing operations. Refer to
Note 6 to these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Joint
Venture agreement 

We
have equity interest in unconsolidated arrangement that is primarily engaged in the business of drug discovery, development, and commercialization,
including but not limited to development and commercialization of TGF-beta therapeutics as well as establishing and operating contract
development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) facilities and capabilities. The Company first review the arrangement to determine
if it meets the definition of an accounting joint venture pursuant to ASC 323-10-20. In order to meet the definition of a joint venture,
the arrangement must have all of the following characteristics, (i) the arrangement is organized within a separate legal entity, (ii)
the entity is under the joint control of the venturers, (iii) the venturers must be able to exercise joint control through their equity
investments, (iv) the qualitative characteristics of the entity, including its purpose and design must be consistent with the definition
of a joint venture 

We
consolidate arrangements that are considered to be VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We analyze our investments in joint ventures
to determine if the joint venture is considered a VIE and would require consolidation. We (i) evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity
investment at risk, (ii) review the voting rights and decision-making authority of the equity investment holders as a group and whether
there are limited partners (or similar owning entities) that lack substantive participating or kick out rights, guaranteed returns, protection
against losses, or capping of residual returns within the group and (iii) establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf
of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this VIE determination. 

To
the extent that we own interests in a VIE and we (i) have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic
performance of the VIE and (ii) have the obligation or rights to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant
to the VIE, then we would be determined to be the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the VIE. To the extent that we own interests
in a VIE, then at each reporting period, we re-assess our conclusions as to which, if any, party within the VIE is considered the primary
beneficiary. 

To
the extent that our arrangements do not qualify as VIEs, they are consolidated if we control them through majority ownership interests
or if we are the managing entity (general partner or managing member) and our partner does not have substantive participating rights.
Control is further demonstrated by our ability to unilaterally make significant operating decisions, refinance debt, and sell the assets
of the joint venture without the consent of the non-managing entity and the inability of the non-managing entity to remove us from our
role as the managing entity. 

43 

We
use the equity method of accounting for those arrangements where we exercise significant influence but do not have control. Under the
equity method of accounting, our investment in each arrangement is included on our consolidated balance sheet; however, the assets and
liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our consolidated balance sheet. 

When
we sell or contribute properties to unconsolidated arrangements and retain a non-controlling ownership interest in such assets, we recognize
the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the asset sold or contributed when its derecognition criteria
are met. The equity method investment we retain in such partial sale transactions is noncash consideration and is measured at fair value.
As a result, the accounting for a partial sale will result in the recognition of a full gain or loss. 

When
circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is
other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at
fair value. 

The
Company elected the fair value option under the fair value option Subsection of Section 825-10-15 to account for its equity-method investment. 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development expense consist of costs we incur for the development of our investigational drugs and, to a lesser extent, for preclinical
research activities. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expense include clinical trial
costs, salaries and benefits of employees, including associated stock-based compensation, payments to clinical investigators, drug manufacturing
costs, laboratory supplies and facility costs. Clinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expense,
and these can be difficult to accurately estimate. Included in clinical trial costs are fees paid to other entities that conduct certain
research and development activities on our behalf, such as clinical research organizations, or CROs. We estimate clinical trial expense
based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions such as CROs and the actual clinical investigators.
These estimates are based on actual time and expenses incurred by the CRO and the clinical investigators. Also included in clinical trial
expense are costs based on the level of patient enrollment into the clinical trial and the actual services performed under the related
clinical trial agreement. Changes in clinical trial assumptions, such as the length of time estimated to enroll all patients, rate of
screening failures, patient drop-out rates, number and nature of adverse event reports and the total number of patients enrolled can
impact the average and expected cost per patient and the overall cost of the clinical trial. Based on patient enrollment reports and
services provided, we may periodically adjust estimates for the clinical trial costs. If we do not identify costs that we have begun
to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed, the length of time for these services or the costs of
these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. 

Share-Based
Compensation 

We
record the estimated fair value of all share-based payments issued to employees and other service providers. Our share-based payments
consist primarily of stock options. The valuation of stock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are not available
for any stock options in our equity securities. Market values are also not available on long-term, non-transferable stock options in
other equity securities. With no market values on options to trade in our common stock and no comparable market values on any long-term
non-transferable stock options, the process of valuing our stock options is even more uncertain and subjective. Accordingly, we use a
Black-Scholes option pricing model to derive an estimated fair value of the stock options which we issue. The Black-Scholes option pricing
model requires certain input assumptions, including the expected term of the options and the expected volatility of our common stock.
Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value that we record for share-based payments that we
issue. We determine the term of the options based on the simplified method, which averages the vesting period and the contractual life
of the stock option. We determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate
with the option s expected term. The Black-Scholes option pricing model also requires assumptions for risk-free interest rates
and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, but we feel that these values are more objective and note that changes in these
values do not have a significant impact on the estimated value of the options when compared to the volatility and term assumptions. 

44 

We
are also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards
that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting,
and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate.

Net
Income (Loss 

We
recorded a net loss of approximately 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loss of approximately
 41 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary difference in net loss, of approximately 3.4 million, between
the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to higher goodwill impairment of approximately
 3.2 million, higher other operating expenses of approximately 30 thousand, higher change in value of derivatives on debt of approximately
 0.2 million, and offset by lower loss on debt conversion of approximately 0.1 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development R D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in
2023 were lower by approximately 21 thousand, primarily due to other operational expenses related to OT-101 being borne by the JV. 

As
previously disclosed, and as a result of our JV, we expect our R D expense to decrease for the remainder of the year 2024, specifically
for activities related to OT-101, including the initiation of new clinical trials. Any other development expenses will be subject to
our continuing ability to secure sufficient funding to continue planned operations. 

45 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative G A expenses increased by approximately 46 thousand for the three months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher legal and professional expenses of approximately
 140 thousand, offset by lower other expenses by approximately 94 thousand. 

As
previously disclosed and as a result of our JV, we expect our G A activities to remain steady or marginally increase for the remainder
of 2024. Any other G A expenses will be subject to our continuing ability to secure sufficient funding to continue planned operations. 

Goodwill
Impairment 

We
recorded goodwill impairment of 3.2 million, on the approximately 12.0 million goodwill which we recorded upon our acquisition of PointR,
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to no impairment during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, we observed a decline of our stock price, the market capitalization of our Company, and the general economic
conditions, which adversely impacted the majority of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. These were indicative of a potential
impairment of our goodwill. While we evaluated and concluded that the AI technologies related to the PointR acquisition are not adversely
impacted as the Company continues to develop other AI technologies, the significant reduction of our market capitalization required us
to record an impairment on the goodwill to the extent of the difference between the net assets of the Company over the fair value, solely
based on the market capitalization, and consistently with the methodology we used during the prior periods. 

Interest
Expense, Net 

We
recorded interest expense, including amortization of debt costs, of approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30,
2024, compared to similar expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily in connection with debt raised from convertible
notes and the JH Darbie Financing, March 2022 and May/June 202 financing. For more information on debt raised from convertible notes
and the JH Darbie Financing, see Note 5 and Note 7 of the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. 

Change
in Value of Derivatives 

During
the three months ended September, 2024, we recorded approximately 0.1 million change in value upon conversion of certain debt owed on the
convertible promissory notes issued to our CEO and a bridge investor (collectively, the Convertible Notes ). The
Company recorded approximately 0.3 million change during the same period in 2023. The Convertible Notes became convertible 180 days
after issuance, and as such the CEO and the bridge investor had the ability to convert that debt into equity at a variable conversion
price, giving rise to a derivative feature within the debt instrument resulting in the recording of a derivative liability and change
in value of the derivative. For more information on value of derivatives, refer to the Note 5 of the Unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements of this Quarterly Report.

Net
Income 

We
recorded a net loss of approximately 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of approximately
 7.4 million for the same period ended September 30, 2023. The difference in net loss, of approximately 3.3 million, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023, was primarily due to lower goodwill impairment of approximately 2.8
million, lower operating expense of approximately 0.2 million, lower interest cost of approximately 0.2 million, lower change in value
of derivatives on debt of approximately 0.2 million, offset by lower reimbursement of expenses by a related party of approximately 50
thousand and lower service revenue of approximately 70 thousand, compared to the same period in 2024. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development R D expenses decreased by approximately 48 thousand for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to reduced operational costs. As a result of our JV with Dragon and GMP Bio,
the JV absorbed most of the compensation costs as well as some of the operational costs. 

As
a result of our JV, we expect our R D expense to decrease for the remainder of the year 2024, specifically for activities related
to OT-101, including the initiation of new clinical trials. Any other development expenses will be subject to our continuing ability
to secure sufficient funding to continue planned operations. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative G A expenses decreased by approximately 0.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the same period ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower operational costs. 

As
a result of our JV, we expect our G A activities to remain steady or marginally increase for the remainder of 2024. Any other G A
expenses will be subject to our continuing ability to secure sufficient funding to continue planned operations. 

Goodwill
Impairment 

We
recorded goodwill impairment of 3.2 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to goodwill impairment of approximately
 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, on the approximately 12.0 million goodwill which we recorded upon our acquisition
of PointR. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, we observed a further decline of our stock price, the market capitalization of our Company, and the general
economic conditions, which adversely impacted the majority of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. These were indicative of
a potential impairment of our goodwill. While we evaluated and concluded that the AI technologies related to the PointR acquisition are
not adversely impacted as the Company continues to develop other AI technologies, the significant reduction of our market capitalization
required us to record an impairment on the goodwill to the extent of the difference between the net assets of the Company over the fair
value, solely based on the market capitalization, and consistently with the methodology we used during the prior periods. 

47 

Interest
Expense, Net 

We
recorded interest expense, including amortization of debt costs, of approximately 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 as compared to 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily in connection with debt raised from convertible
notes, JH Darbie Financing, March 2022 and May/June 2022 Financing. Interest expense was lower for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 due to some of the outstanding loans being partially or fully retired. For more information
on debt raised from convertible notes and the JH Darbie Financing, see Note 5 and Note 7 of the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
of this Quarterly Report. 

Reimbursement
of expenses 

The
Company was reimbursed 23 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 72 thousand, by Autotelic
Inc. a related party, on behalf of our JV. 

Change
in Value of Derivatives 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately 0.1 million gain in value upon conversion of the debt to liabilities
as a derivative as well as new debt converting to liabilities on the Convertible Notes as compared to approximately 0.3 million gain
during the same period of 2023. The Convertible Notes became convertible 180 days after issuance, and as such Peak One, TFK, the CEO
and the bridge investor had the ability to convert that debt into equity at: (i) the variable conversion price of 65 of the Company s
lowest traded price after the first 180 days, or (ii) at the lower of 0.10 per share or 55 of the Company s traded stock price
under certain circumstances. This gave rise to a derivative feature within the debt instrument which resulted in the recording of a derivative
liability and change in value of the derivative. 

Loss
on Conversion of Debt 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a loss of 0.1 million on conversion of debt. related to the difference in fair
value to the price at which the debt was converted, compared to a 0.1 million loss on conversion of debt during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023.

The
Company has experienced net losses every year since inception and as of September 30, 2024 had an accumulated deficit of approximately
 37.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 0.2 million in cash, and current liabilities of approximately
 16.1 million. Of the approximately 16.1 million in current liabilities, of which approximately 1.3 million are net assumed liabilities
of the Company as part of the Oncotelic Inc. reverse merger, 4.7 million was debt for conducting clinical trials for OT-101 from GMP
and 2.6 million related to contingent liability to issue Common Stock of the Company to PointR shareholders upon achievement of certain
milestones. The Company does not expect to generate any meaningful revenue from product sales or licensing in the near future and expects
to incur additional operating losses over the next several years, primarily as a result of the Company s plans to continue clinical
trials for its investigational drugs. Since the Company successfully formed the joint venture with Dragon Overseas and GMP Bio, all costs
associated with developing the assets licensed to the JV and a substantial portion of the G A expenses will shift over to the JV
and hence the Company may be able to reduce its expenses. The Company s limited capital resources, history of recurring losses
and uncertainties as to whether the Company s operations will become profitable raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements contained in this report do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of
assets or classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

48 

The
principal source of the Company s working capital deficit to date has been the issuance of convertible notes, a substantial part
of which has been provided by officers and certain insiders, and sale of equity under the EPA with Peak One. The Company will need to
raise additional capital in order to fund its operations and continue development of product candidates. The Company is evaluating the
options to further the development of the Company s product candidates, AL-101, Artemisinin for COVID-19, developing AI technologies
to support the COVID-19 therapies; in addition to evaluating the development pathway of its product candidates; OXi4503 and/or CA4P.
The Company is also independently planning to develop OT-101 for certain animal health indications and contemplating using crypto currencies
for that platform. 

The
Company anticipates raising substantial additional capital through the sale of equity securities and/or debt, but no other financing
arrangements are in place at this time. 

If
the Company is unable to access additional funds when needed, it may not be able to continue the development of these investigational
drugs and the Company could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its development programs and operations. Any
additional equity financing, if available, would be dilutive to the current stockholders and may not be available on favorable terms.
Additional debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could also be dilutive. The Company s ability to
access capital is not assured and, if access is not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm the Company s financial condition,
the value of its Common Stock and its business prospects.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was due to the net
loss of approximately 4.1 million, and primarily offset by approximately 3.2 million of amortization of goodwill, approximately 88
thousand from loss on conversion of debt, approximately 0.1 million of change in fair value of derivative, approximately 0.1 million
due to amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs and changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately 0.2
million. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was approximately 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was due to the net
loss of approximately 7.4 million, primarily offset by non-cash goodwill impairment of approximately 6.1 million, non-cash loss on
debt conversion of approximately 0.1 million, change in pair value of derivatives of approximately 21,000 and changes in operating
assets and liabilities of approximately 0.3 million. 

Financing
Activities 

For
the nine months ended September 30,2024, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 0.6 million, primarily due to receipt
of a short term loan from a related party. 

49 

For
the nine months ended September 30,2023, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 1.0 million, primarily due to short
term loans and convertible debt of approximately 1.1 million, offset by repayments to one PPM debt holder and short term loans of approximately
 0.1 million 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Effects
of Inflation 

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Our
current drug development programs are based on a series of compounds called combretastatins, which we have exclusively licensed from
Arizona State University, or ASU. If our current drug candidates are approved, we will be required to pay low to mid-single-digit royalties
on future net sales of products associated with the ASU patent rights until these patent rights expire. 

We
also have an exclusive license from Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, for certain patent rights to particular combretastatins, including
CA4P. If CA4P is approved, we will be required to pay low-single-digit royalties on future net sales of products associated with the
BMS patent rights until these patent rights expire. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Our
cash is maintained in U.S. dollar accounts. We have adopted a policy for the cash that we hold, and also for any cash equivalents and
investments that we may hold, the primary objective of which is to preserve principal, while also maintaining liquidity to meet our operating
needs and maximize yields to the extent possible. Although our investments can be subject to credit risk, we follow procedures to limit
the amount of credit exposure in any single issue, issuer or type of investment. Our investments are also subject to interest rate risk
and would be likely to decrease in value if market interest rates increase. However, due to the generally conservative nature of our
investments and relatively short duration, we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated. 

Although
we may from time-to-time manufacture drugs and conduct preclinical or clinical trials outside of the United States, we believe our exposure
to foreign currency risk to be immaterial. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls
and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. 

50 

As
required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act our Chief Executive
Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO conducted an evaluation as of the end of
the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and our CFO each concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act, (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
CEO and our CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the framework
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Registrant s internal control over financial reporting
as of June 30, 2023 was not effective as a result of certain material weaknesses. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

The
ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which are observed in many
small companies with a small number of accounting and financial reporting staff: 

Lack
 of formal policies and procedures; 

Lack
 of a functioning audit committee and independent directors on the Company s board of directors to oversee financial reporting
 responsibilities; 

Inadequate
 or lack of segregation of duties; 

Lack
 of dedicated resources and experienced personnel to design and implement internal control procedures to support financial reporting
 objectives; 

Lack
 of qualified accounting personnel to prepare and report financial information in accordance with GAAP; and 

Lack
 of risk assessment procedures on internal controls to detect financial reporting risks on a timely manner. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 

Management
has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness
are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions planned include: 

Continue
 to search for, evaluate and recruit qualified independent outside directors; 

Hire
 qualified accounting personnel to prepare and report financial information in accordance with GAAP; 

Identify
 gaps in our skills base and the expertise of our staff required to meet the financial reporting requirements of a public company;
 and 

Continue
 to develop policies and procedures on internal control over financial reporting and monitor the effectiveness of operations on existing
 controls and procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to execute upon our planned remediation actions which are all intended to strengthen
our overall control environment. While we have made progress in our planned remediation efforts and we expect the Company to complete
its planned execution of internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2023, however, our ability to
do so would greatly depend on our ability to obtain financial and other resources to complete the remediation. 

We
are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believe that these remediation efforts will represent significant
improvements in our control environment. Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the relevance of our risk-based approach
and the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking
further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

The
Company had disputed a judgement of 20,000 for a non-payment to a third service provider. The Company considered the claim to be immaterial
to the financial position of the Company. The Company had filed a counter claim on the third-party service provider as the Company believed
the claim to be false and malicious to the interests of the Company. The Honorable Court overruled the previous judgement and the Company
had sued the third-party service provider. In March 2024, the Honorable Court s decision was in favor of the Company due to the
reasons described above and the matter has been dismissed. The third party service provider had filed an appeal with the Honorable Court,
and the Honorable Court dismissed their appeal. 

Other
claims 

One
of the Company s ex-employees has made a breach of employment contract claim against the Company. The Company and its legal counsel
are evaluating the validity of the claim, as the Company believes that such claim has limited merits and is hopeful to attain a positive
outcome for such claim. Since the Company and its legal counsel are still evaluating the claim, we are unable to quantify the amount
such claim would be settled at, if at all settled. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Please
see the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 12,
2024 and other SEC filings. The risks described below and in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds
