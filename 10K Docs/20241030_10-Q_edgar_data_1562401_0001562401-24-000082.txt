EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of American Homes 4 Rent and American Homes 4 Rent, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to AMH or the General Partner mean American Homes 4 Rent, a Maryland real estate investment trust REIT ), and references to the Operating Partnership or the OP mean American Homes 4 Rent, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. References to the Company, we, our and us mean collectively AMH, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by AMH and/or the Operating Partnership. 
 
 AMH is the general partner of, and as of September 30, 2024 owned approximately 87.7 of the common partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership. The remaining 12.3 of the common partnership interest was owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, AMH has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management. The Company s management operates AMH and the Operating Partnership as one business, and the management of AMH consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 
 enhances investors understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 
 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between AMH and the Operating Partnership in the context of how AMH and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. AMH s primary function is acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership. The only material asset of AMH is its partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. As a result, AMH generally does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. AMH itself is not directly obligated under any indebtedness, but guarantees some of the debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership owns substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in its joint ventures, either directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts the operations of the Company s business and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity. AMH contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions, AMH receives Operating Partnership units OP units equal to the number of shares it has issued in the equity offering. Based on the terms of the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, as amended, OP units can be exchanged for shares on a one-for-one basis. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by AMH, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of OP units. 
 
 Shareholders equity, partners capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements. The differences between shareholders equity and partners capital result from differences in the equity and capital issued at the Company and Operating Partnership levels. 
 
 To help investors understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate condensed consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Operating Partnership; a single set of notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity s debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders equity or partners capital, as applicable; and a combined Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity. 
 
 This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that the 

Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 18 U.S.C. 1350. 
 
 In order to highlight the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the Company is one business and the Company operates that business through the Operating Partnership. The separate discussions of the Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Various statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may relate to beliefs, expectations or intentions and similar statements concerning matters that are not of historical fact and are generally accompanied by words such as estimate, project, predict, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, potential, plan, goal, outlook, guidance or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 
 
 These and other important factors, including those discussed or incorporated by reference under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 
 
 While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, assumptions and expectations, they are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not unduly rely on them. The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to update or revise these statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by applicable law.

 AMH is the general partner of, and as of September 30, 2024 owned approximately of the common partnership interest in, the Operating Partnership. The remaining of the common partnership interest was owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, AMH has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management. The Company s management operates AMH and the Operating Partnership as one business, and the management of AMH consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. AMH s primary function is acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership. The only material asset of AMH is its partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. As a result, AMH generally does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership. AMH itself is not directly obligated under any indebtedness, but guarantees some of the debt of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership owns substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in its joint ventures, either directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts the operations of the Company s business and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity. One difference between the Company and the Operating Partnership was million of asset-backed securitization certificates issued by the Operating Partnership and purchased by AMH in connection with the Operating Partnership s AMH 2014-SFR2 securitization debt offering. The asset-backed securitization certificates were recorded as an asset-backed securitization certificates receivable by the Company and as an amount due from affiliates by the Operating Partnership prior to the Operating Partnership s payoff of the AMH 2014-SFR2 securitization during the first quarter of 2024 (see Note 8. Debt). AMH contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to the Operating Partnership. In return for those contributions, AMH receives Operating Partnership units OP units equal to the number of shares it has issued in the equity offering. Based on the terms of the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Operating Partnership, as amended, OP units can be exchanged for shares on a -for-one basis. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by AMH, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of OP units.

To date, the guarantees have not been invoked, and we believe that the actions that would trigger a guarantee would generally be disadvantageous to the joint ventures and us and therefore are unlikely to occur. However, there can be no assurances that actions that could trigger the guarantee will not occur.

 During the third quarter of 2024, in anticipation of a potential debt issuance and in order to hedge interest rate risk, the Company entered into treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million based on the treasury note rates at the time. The treasury locks were designated as cash flow hedging instruments and had an aggregate fair value of million as of September 30, 2024, which was included in escrow deposits, prepaid expenses and other assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding unrealized gain reflected in other comprehensive income. The treasury locks will be settled upon the issuance of debt and the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the debt. The treasury locks are the only financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated financial statements and are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy as their fair values are estimated using observable inputs based on the treasury note rate.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
 
 We are a Maryland REIT focused on acquiring, developing, renovating, leasing and managing single-family homes as rental properties. The Operating Partnership is the entity through which we conduct substantially all of our business and own, directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. We commenced operations in November 2012 and we have elected to be taxed as a REIT. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we owned 59,902 single-family properties in select submarkets of metropolitan statistical areas in 21 states, including 1,003 properties held for sale, compared to 59,332 single-family properties in 21 states, including 862 properties held for sale, as of December 31, 2023 and 59,092 single-family properties in 21 states, including 700 properties held for sale, as of September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 55,726 of our total properties (excluding properties held for sale) were occupied, compared to 55,768 of our total properties (excluding properties held for sale) as of December 31, 2023 and 55,949 of our total properties (excluding properties held for sale) as of September 30, 2023. Also, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an additional 3,271 properties held in unconsolidated joint ventures, compared to 2,978 properties held in unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2023 and 2,936 properties held in unconsolidated joint ventures as of September 30, 2023. Our portfolio of single-family properties, including those held in our unconsolidated joint ventures, is internally managed through our proprietary property management platform.

 We believe these key single-family property and leasing metrics provide useful information to investors because they allow investors to understand the composition and performance of our properties on a market by market basis. Management also uses these metrics to understand the composition and performance of our properties at the market level. 
 
 Factors That Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include the pace at which we identify and acquire suitable land and properties, the time and cost required to renovate the acquired properties, the pace and cost of our property developments, the time to lease newly acquired or developed properties at acceptable rental rates, occupancy levels, rates of tenant turnover, the length of vacancy in properties between tenant leases, our expense ratios, property taxes including changes in rates and valuation assessments of our properties, our ability to raise capital and our capital structure. Additionally, further supply chain disruptions, inflationary increases in labor and material costs and labor shortages may have the potential to impact certain aspects of our business, including our AMH Development Program, our renovation program associated with acquired properties and our maintenance program. 
 
 Property Acquisitions, Development and Dispositions 
 
 Since our formation, we have rapidly but systematically grown our portfolio of single-family properties. Our ability to identify and acquire homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in our target markets, the inventory of properties available-for-sale through traditional acquisition channels, availability of bulk portfolio acquisition opportunities, competition for our target assets and our available capital. We are also focused on developing built-for-rental homes through our internal AMH Development Program. In addition, we acquire newly constructed homes from third-party developers through our National Builder 
 
 33 

Program. Opportunities from these new construction channels are impacted by the availability of vacant developed lots, development land assets and inventory of homes currently under construction or newly developed. Our level of investment activity has fluctuated based on the number of suitable opportunities and the level of capital available to invest. We have strategically scaled back acquisitions of single-family properties through our National Builder Program and traditional acquisition channels as the housing market adjusts to the current macroeconomic environment. We will continue to evaluate all of our growth channels and grow accordingly, if and when, acquisition opportunities are attractive relative to the condition of capital markets. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we developed or acquired 656 homes, including 640 newly constructed homes delivered to our operating portfolio through our AMH Development Program and 16 homes acquired through our traditional acquisition channel, partially offset by 617 homes identified for sale. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we also developed an additional 113 newly constructed homes which were delivered to our unconsolidated joint ventures, aggregating to 753 total home deliveries through our AMH Development Program. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we developed or acquired 1,706 homes, including 1,661 newly constructed homes delivered to our operating portfolio through our AMH Development Program and 45 homes acquired through our National Builder Program and traditional acquisition channel, partially offset by 1,277 homes identified for sale or contributed to unconsolidated joint ventures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also developed an additional 232 newly constructed homes which were delivered to our unconsolidated joint ventures, aggregating to 1,893 total home deliveries through our AMH Development Program. 
 
 Our properties and land held for sale were identified based on individual asset-level review, as well as submarket analysis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 1,003 and 862 properties, respectively, as well as certain land lots, classified as held for sale. We will continue to evaluate our properties and land for potential disposition going forward as a normal course of business. 
 
 Property Operations 
 
 Homes added to our portfolio through new construction channels include properties developed through our internal AMH Development Program and newly constructed properties acquired from third-party developers through our National Builder Program. Rental homes developed through our AMH Development Program involve substantial up-front costs, time to acquire and develop land, time to build the rental home, and time to lease the rental home before the home generates income. This process is dependent upon the nature of each lot acquired and the timeline varies primarily due to land development requirements. Once land development requirements have been met, historically it has taken approximately four to six months to complete the rental home vertical construction process. However, delivery of homes may be staggered to facilitate leasing absorption. Our internal construction program is managed by our team of development professionals that oversee the full rental home construction process including all land development and work performed by subcontractors. We typically incur costs between 250,000 and 450,000 to acquire and develop land and build a rental home. Homes added through our AMH Development Program are available for lease immediately upon or shortly after receipt of a certificate of occupancy. Rental homes acquired from third-party developers through our National Builder Program are dependent on the inventory of newly constructed homes and homes currently under construction. 
 
 Homes added to our portfolio through traditional acquisition channels require expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price, including property inspections, closing costs, liens, title insurance, transfer taxes, recording fees, broker commissions, property taxes and homeowner association HOA fees, when applicable. In addition, we typically incur costs between 20,000 and 40,000 to renovate a home acquired through traditional acquisition channels to prepare it for rental. Renovation work varies, but may include paint, flooring, cabinetry, appliances, plumbing hardware and other items required to prepare the home for rental. The time and cost involved to prepare our homes for rental can impact our financial performance and varies among properties based on several factors, including the source of acquisition channel and age and condition of the property. Historically, it has taken approximately 20 to 90 days to complete the renovation process, which will fluctuate based on our overall acquisition volume as well as availability of construction labor and materials. 
 
 Our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property, which can vary greatly among properties, and is impacted by local demand, our marketing techniques and the size of our available inventory. Typically, it takes approximately 10 to 50 days to lease a property after acquiring or developing a new property through our new construction channels and 20 to 40 days after completing the renovation process for a traditionally acquired property. Lastly, our operating results are impacted by the length of stay of our tenants and the amount of time it takes to prepare and re-lease a property after a tenant vacates. This process, which we refer to as turnover, is impacted by numerous factors, including the condition of the home upon move-out of the previous tenant, and by local demand, our marketing techniques and the size of our available inventory at the time of the turnover. Typically, it takes approximately 20 to 50 days to complete the turnover process. 

34 

Revenues 
 
 Our revenues are derived primarily from rents collected from tenants for our single-family properties under lease agreements which typically have a term of one year. Our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and property-level factors, including market conditions, seasonality and tenant defaults, and the amount of time it takes to turn properties when tenants vacate. Additionally, our ability to collect revenues and related operating results are impacted by the credit worthiness and quality of our tenants. Typically, our incoming residents have household incomes ranging from 80,000 to 140,000 and primarily consist of families with approximately two adults and one or more children. 
 
 Our rents and other single-family property revenues are comprised of rental revenue from single-family properties, fees from our single-family property rentals and tenant charge-backs, which are primarily related to cost recoveries on utilities. 
 
 Our ability to maintain and grow revenues from our existing portfolio of homes will be dependent on our ability to retain tenants and increase rental rates. Based on our Same-Home population of properties (defined below), the year-over-year increase in Average Monthly Realized Rent per property was 5.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and we experienced turnover rates, which represents the number of tenant move-outs during the period divided by the total number of properties, of 8.0 and 8.4 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Based on our Same-Home population of properties, the year-over-year increase in Average Monthly Realized Rent per property was 5.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we experienced turnover rates of 21.8 and 23.4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 We monitor the following categories of expenses that we believe most significantly affect our results of operations. 
 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 
 Once a property is available for lease for the first time, which we refer to as rent-ready, we incur ongoing property-related expenses which may not be subject to our control. These include primarily property taxes, repairs and maintenance R M ), turnover costs, HOA fees (when applicable) and insurance. 
 
 Property Management Expenses 
 
 As we internally manage our portfolio of single-family properties through our proprietary property management platform, we incur costs such as salary expenses for property management personnel, lease expenses and operating costs for property management offices and technology expenses for maintaining as well as enhancing our property management platform. As part of developing our property management platform, we continue to make significant investments in our personnel, infrastructure, systems and technology that will impact expenses based on investment programs during the year. We believe that these investments will enable our property management platform to become more efficient over time, especially as our portfolio grows. Also included in property management expenses is noncash share-based compensation expense related to centralized and field property management employees. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We believe that our business and related operating results will be impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. Historically, we have experienced higher levels of tenant move-outs and move-ins during the late spring and summer months, which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs. Our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets for expenses such as HVAC repairs, turn costs and landscaping expenses during the summer season. Additionally, our single-family properties are at greater risk in certain markets for adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the late summer months and extreme cold weather in the winter months. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense primarily consists of corporate payroll and personnel costs, federal and state taxes, trustees and officers insurance expenses, audit and tax fees, trustee fees and other expenses associated with our corporate and administrative functions. In addition, we continue to make corporate level investments to support certain initiatives which will impact expenses based on given investment programs during the year. Also included in general and administrative expense is noncash share-based compensation expense related to corporate administrative employees. 

35 

Results of Operations 
 
 Net income totaled 87.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 88.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 5.3 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and 3.9 million of hurricane-related charges, net in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in other income and expense, net as a result of higher interest income as well as increases in rents and other single-family property revenues exceeding increases in total expenses excluding hurricane-related charges, net. Net income totaled 324.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 341.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower net gains on property sales as well as a 6.3 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and 3.9 million of hurricane-related charges, net during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by increases in rents and other single-family property revenues exceeding increases in total expenses excluding hurricane-related charges, net. 
 
 As we continue to grow our portfolio with a portion of our homes still recently developed, acquired and/or renovated, we distinguish our portfolio of homes between Same-Home properties and Non-Same-Home and Other properties in evaluating our operating performance. We classify a property as Same-Home if it has been stabilized longer than 90 days prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented under comparison and if it has not been classified as held for sale or experienced a casualty loss, which allows the performance of these properties to be compared between periods. Single-family properties that we acquire individually (i.e., not through a bulk purchase) are classified as either stabilized or non-stabilized. A property is classified as stabilized once it has been renovated by the Company or newly constructed and then initially leased or available for rent for a period greater than 90 days. Properties acquired through a bulk purchase are first considered non-stabilized, as an entire group, until (1) we have owned them for an adequate period of time to allow for complete on-boarding to our operating platform, and (2) a substantial portion of the properties have experienced tenant turnover at least once under our ownership, providing the opportunity for renovations and improvements to meet our property standards. After such time has passed, properties acquired through a bulk purchase are then evaluated on an individual property basis under our standard stabilization criteria. All other properties, including those classified as held for sale or taken out of service as a result of a casualty loss, are classified as Non-Same-Home and Other. 
 
 One of the primary financial measures we use in evaluating the operating performance of our single-family properties is Core Net Operating Income Core NOI ), which we also present separately for our Same-Home portfolio. Core NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that we define as core revenues, which is calculated as rents and other single-family property revenues, excluding expenses reimbursed by tenant charge-backs, less core property operating expenses, which is calculated as property operating and property management expenses, excluding noncash share-based compensation expense and expenses reimbursed by tenant charge-backs. 
 
 Core NOI also excludes (1) hurricane-related charges, net, which result in material charges to our single-family property portfolio, (2) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, (3) gains and losses from sales or impairments of single-family properties and other, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) acquisition and other transaction costs incurred with business combinations and the acquisition or disposition of properties as well as nonrecurring items unrelated to ongoing operations, (6) noncash share-based compensation expense, (7) interest expense, (8) general and administrative expense, and (9) other income and expense, net. We believe Core NOI provides useful information to investors about the operating performance of our single-family properties without the impact of certain operating expenses that are reimbursed through tenant charge-backs. 
 
 Core NOI and Same-Home Core NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income or loss as a measure of our performance and should not be used as measures of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. Additionally, these metrics should not be used as substitutes for net income or loss or net cash flows from operating activities (as computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP )).

 Rents and other single-family property revenues increased 5.5 to 445.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 421.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue growth was primarily driven by higher rental rates. 
 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 
 Property operating expenses increased 3.0 to 172.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 167.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by annual increases in property tax expense. 
 
 Property Management Expenses 
 
 Property management expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 32.0 million and 30.8 million, respectively, which included 1.0 million of noncash share-based compensation expense in each period related to centralized and field 
 
 38 

property management employees. The increase in property management expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related expenses. 
 
 Core Revenues from Same-Home Properties 
 
 Core revenues from Same-Home properties increased 4.4 to 335.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 321.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to higher Average Monthly Realized Rent per property, which increased 5.1 to 2,208 per month for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,100 per month for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in Average Occupied Days Percentage, which was 95.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 96.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Core Property Operating Expenses from Same-Home Properties 
 
 Core property operating expenses from Same-Home properties consist of direct property operating expenses, net of tenant charge-backs, and property management costs, net of tenant charge-backs, and excludes noncash share-based compensation expense. Core property operating expenses from Same-Home properties increased 2.6 to 118.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 115.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by annual increases in property tax expense and partially offset by lower R M and turnover costs, net. 
 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 
 General and administrative expense primarily consists of corporate payroll and personnel costs, federal and state taxes, trustees and officers insurance expense, audit and tax fees, trustee fees and other expenses associated with our corporate and administrative functions. General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 19.2 million and 18.3 million, respectively, which included 3.6 million and 4.2 million, respectively, of noncash share-based compensation expense in each period related to corporate administrative employees. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily related to an increase in personnel related expenses. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense increased 26.8 to 43.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 34.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional interest from the issuances of unsecured senior notes in January 2024 and June 2024, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the payoffs of the AMH 2014-SFR2 securitization in February 2024 and AMH 2014-SFR3 securitization in August 2024. 
 
 Acquisition and Other Transaction Costs 
 
 Acquisition and other transaction costs consist primarily of personnel and platform costs associated with purchases of single-family properties, including newly constructed properties from third-party builders, or the disposal of certain properties or portfolios of properties which do not qualify for capitalization. Acquisition and other transaction costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 2.6 million and 3.4 million, respectively, which included 1.1 million and 1.3 million, respectively, of noncash share-based compensation expense in each period related to employees in these functions. The decrease in acquisition and other transaction costs was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs as a result of fewer planned transactions through our traditional acquisition channel during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of buildings and improvements. Depreciation of our assets is calculated over their useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to 30 years. Our intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset s estimated economic useful life. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.2 to 119.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 114.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to growth in the average number and cost of depreciable properties as well as ongoing capital investments into existing properties.

 Gain on Sale and Impairment of Single-Family Properties and Other, net 
 
 Gain on sale and impairment of single-family properties and other, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 32.7 million and 33.3 million, respectively, which included 3.2 million and 0.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges related to homes classified as held for sale during each period. 
 
 Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt was 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to zero for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the termination of our previous revolving credit facility in July 2024 and the payoff of the AMH 2014-SFR3 securitization in August 2024. 
 
 Other Income and Expense, net 
 
 Other income and expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 8.3 million and 1.9 million, respectively, which primarily related to interest income, fees from unconsolidated joint ventures and equity in income (losses) from unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by expenses related to unconsolidated joint ventures and other nonrecurring expenses.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting estimates are included in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this report for a discussion of the adoption and potential impact of recently issued accounting standards, if any. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations, make distributions to our shareholders and OP unitholders, including AMH, and meet other general requirements of our business. Our liquidity, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. 
 
 Sources of Capital 
 
 We expect to satisfy our cash requirements through cash provided by operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, issuances of debt and equity securities (including OP units), property dispositions and joint venture transactions. We expect to meet our operating liquidity requirements and our dividend distributions generally through cash on hand and cash provided by operations. For our acquisition and development expenditures, we expect to supplement these sources through the issuance of equity securities, including under our 2023 At-the-Market Program described below, borrowings under our 1.25 billion credit facility, issuances of unsecured senior notes, and proceeds from sales of single-family properties. However, our real estate assets are illiquid in nature. A timely liquidation of assets might not be a viable source of short-term liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise, and we may need to source liquidity from other financing alternatives including drawing on our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024 included 162.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and 2.3 million committed to outstanding letters of credit under our 1.25 billion revolving credit facility, leaving 1.25 billion of remaining borrowing capacity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued (i) 600.0 million of 5.500 unsecured senior notes with a maturity date of February 1, 
 
 44 

2034 (the 2034 Notes I ), raising net proceeds of 595.5 million, (ii) 500.0 million of 5.500 unsecured senior notes with a maturity date of July 15, 2034 (the 2034 Notes II ), raising net proceeds of 494.0 million, and (iii) 932,746 Class A common shares under its 2023 At-the-Market Program, raising gross proceeds of 33.7 million with 864.3 million remaining available for future share issuances as of September 30, 2024. As described below, in October 2024, we also issued and physically settled 2,987,024 Class A common shares under the March 2024 Forward Sale Agreement, receiving net proceeds of 109.8 million. We maintain an investment grade credit rating which provides for greater availability of and lower cost of debt financing. 
 
 Uses of Capital 
 
 Our expected material cash requirements over the next twelve months consist of (i) contractually obligated expenditures, including payments of principal and interest, (ii) other essential expenditures, including property operating expenses, HOA fees (as applicable), real estate taxes, maintenance capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses and dividends on our equity securities including those paid in accordance with REIT distribution requirements, and (iii) opportunistic expenditures, including to pay for the acquisition, development and renovation of our properties and repurchases of our securities. 
 
 With respect to our contractually obligated expenditures, our cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable and accrued expenses, interest payments on debt obligations, principal amortization on our asset-backed securitizations, operating lease obligations and purchase commitments to acquire single-family properties and land for our AMH Development Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repaid all amounts due under the AMH 2014-SFR2 and AMH 2014-SFR3 securitizations. Except as described in Note 8. Debt, Note 9. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses, Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies and Note 16. Subsequent Events to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this report, there have been no other material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our other known contractual obligations described in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2023 Annual Report.

 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 709,348 623,374 85,974 Net cash used for investing activities (293,048) (465,316) 172,268 Net cash used for financing activities (320,312) (133,371) (186,941) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 95,988 24,687 71,301 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash flows provided by operating activities, which is our principal source of cash flows, depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy level of our properties, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collection of rent from our tenants and the level of property operating expenses, property management expenses, general and administrative expense and interest expense. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 86.0 million, or 13.8 , from 623.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 709.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily as a result of increased cash inflows generated from higher rental rates and changes in working capital primarily related to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by higher cash outflows for property related expenses. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities decreased 172.3 million, or 37.0 , from 465.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 293.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our investing activities are most significantly impacted by the level of investment activity through traditional acquisition channels, availability of bulk portfolio acquisition opportunities, the development of built-for-rental homes through our AMH Development Program and the acquisition of newly built properties through our National Builder Program. We have strategically scaled back acquisitions of single-family properties through our National Builder Program and traditional acquisition channels as the housing market adjusts to the current macroeconomic environment. We will continue to evaluate all of our growth channels and grow accordingly, if and when, acquisition opportunities are attractive relative 
 
 45 

to the condition of capital markets. We use cash generated from operating and financing activities and by recycling capital through the sale of single-family properties to invest in the strategic expansion of our single-family property portfolio. 
 
 Cash outflows for the addition of single-family properties to our portfolio, primarily for our AMH Development Program, decreased 42.2 million as a result of the timing of development-related payments. The development of built-for-rental homes and our property-enhancing capital expenditures may reduce recurring and other capital expenditures on an average per-home basis in the future. Cash outflows for recurring and other capital expenditures for single-family properties and renovations to single-family properties decreased 19.3 million largely due to a reduction in spend on property-enhancing capital expenditures. Additional drivers for the decrease in net cash used for investing activities include (i) a 78.0 million increase in distributions from joint ventures, net of contributions, primarily due to additional cash distributions received with respect to our property and land contributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) 25.7 million of cash proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for our AMH 2014-SFR2 Class F asset-backed securitization certificates and (iii) a 10.5 million decrease in cash outflows for other investing activities primarily due to a nonrecurring investment in a residential-focused proptech company during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases in net cash used for investing activities were partially offset by (i) 2.2 million in nonrecurring proceeds received from storm-related insurance claims during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and (ii) a 1.4 million decrease in net proceeds received from sales of single-family properties and other. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used for financing activities increased 186.9 million, or 140.2 , from 133.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 320.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to (i) a 930.3 million increase in payments on asset-backed securitizations resulting from the payoffs of the AMH 2014-SFR2 and AMH 2014-SFR3 securitizations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) a 265.2 million reduction in proceeds from the issuance of Class A common shares, net of offering costs, (iii) a 53.7 million increase in distributions paid to common share and unit holders resulting from an 18 increase in distributions paid per common share and unit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, (iv) 47.9 million of payments to a land banking entity related to liabilities to repurchase consolidated land not owned for our AMH Development Program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and (v) 21.0 million of deferred financings costs paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the issuances of the 2034 Notes I and 2034 Notes II as well as legal and other fees for a new revolving credit facility. These increases in net cash used for financing activities were partially offset by (i) 1.1 billion of proceeds from unsecured senior notes, net of discounts, from the issuances of the 2034 Notes I and 2034 Notes II during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and (ii) a 40.0 million reduction in paydowns on our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Operating Partnership paid off the 460.6 million outstanding principal on the AMH 2014-SFR2 securitization, which resulted in 1.0 million of charges related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and related legal fees and included in loss on early extinguishment of debt within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The payoff of the AMH 2014-SFR2 securitization also resulted in the release of the 4,516 homes pledged as collateral and 10.3 million of cash restricted for lender requirements. The Company received 25.7 million from the payoff for its investment in the AMH 2014-SFR2 Class F asset-backed securitization certificates that were issued by the Operating Partnership and acquired by the Company in 2014 as part of the AMH 2014-SFR2 securitization debt offering. The Class F certificates were recorded as an asset-backed securitization certificates receivable by the Company and as an amount due from affiliates by the Operating Partnership prior to the payoff. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company terminated its previous revolving credit facility, which resulted in 4.8 million of charges related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and included in loss on early extinguishment of debt within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Operating Partnership paid off the 471.8 million outstanding principal on the AMH 2014-SFR3 securitization, which resulted in 0.5 million of charges related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and related legal fees and included in loss on early extinguishment of debt within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The payoff of the AMH 2014-SFR3 securitization also resulted in the release of the 4,541 homes pledged as collateral and 10.9 million of cash restricted for lender requirements. 
 
 Unsecured Senior Notes 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Operating Partnership issued the 2034 Notes I, which carry a green bond designation and were issued under the Company s green finance framework. Interest on the 2034 Notes I is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on August 1, 2024. The Operating Partnership received aggregate net proceeds of 595.5 million from this offering, after underwriting fees of 3.9 million and a 0.6 million discount, and before offering costs of 
 
 46 

1.3 million. Pending full allocation of an amount equal to the net proceeds to finance new or existing projects meeting the eligibility criteria described in the prospectus supplement related to the offering, the Operating Partnership used the net proceeds primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the payoff of the AMH 2014-SFR2 securitization. The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2034 Notes I in whole at any time or in part from time to time at the applicable redemption price specified in the indenture. If the 2034 Notes I are redeemed on or after November 1, 2033 (three months prior to the maturity date), the redemption price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2034 Notes I being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Operating Partnership issued the 2034 Notes II. Interest on the 2034 Notes II is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2025. The Operating Partnership received aggregate net proceeds of 494.0 million from this offering, after underwriting fees of 3.3 million and a 2.7 million discount, and before offering costs of 1.1 million. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the payoff of the AMH 2014-SFR3 securitization, as well as general corporate purposes. The Operating Partnership may redeem the 2034 Notes II in whole at any time or in part from time to time at the applicable redemption price specified in the indenture. If the 2034 Notes II are redeemed on or after April 15, 2034 (three months prior to the maturity date), the redemption price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2034 Notes II being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 
 The 2034 Notes I and 2034 Notes II are the Operating Partnership s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Operating Partnership s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The indentures require that we maintain certain financial covenants. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with a 1.25 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The interest rate on the new revolving credit facility is at either a daily or Term SOFR plus a 0.10 spread adjustment and a margin ranging from 0.725 to 1.40 or a base rate (determined according to the greater of a prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 or the daily SOFR plus 1.10 plus a margin ranging from 0.00 to 0.40 . In each case the actual margin is determined based on the Company s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The new revolving credit facility matures on July 16, 2028, with two six-month extension options at the Company s election if certain conditions are met. 
 
 At-the-Market Common Share Offering Program 
 
 During the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a new at-the-market common share offering program, replacing the previously expiring program, under which it can issue Class A common shares from time to time through various sales agents up to an aggregate gross sales offering price of 1.0 billion (the 2023 At-the-Market Program ). The 2023 At-the-Market Program also provides that we may enter into forward contracts for our Class A common shares with forward sellers and forward purchasers. The Company intends to use any net proceeds from the 2023 At-the-Market Program (i) to repay indebtedness the Company has incurred or expects to incur under its revolving credit facility or other debt obligations under its securitizations, (ii) to develop new single-family properties and communities, (iii) to acquire and renovate single-family properties and for related activities in accordance with the Company s business strategy and (iv) for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repurchases of the Company s securities, acquisitions of additional properties, capital expenditures and the expansion, redevelopment and/or improvement of properties in the Company s portfolio. The 2023 At-the-Market Program may be suspended or terminated by the Company at any time. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company issued 932,746 Class A common shares under its 2023 At-the-Market Program, raising 33.7 million in gross proceeds before commissions and other expenses of approximately 0.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, 3,732,429 shares have been issued under the 2023 At-the-Market Program and 864.3 million remained available for future share issuances. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a forward sale agreement with the forward purchaser (the March 2024 Forward Sale Agreement ), which is accounted for in equity, to offer 2,987,024 Class A common shares on a forward basis under its 2023 At-the-Market Program at the request of the Company by the forward seller. In October 2024, the Company issued and physically settled the 2,987,024 Class A common shares, receiving net proceeds of 109.8 million. 
 
 When the Company issues common shares, the Operating Partnership issues an equivalent number of units of partnership interest of a corresponding class to AMH, with the Operating Partnership receiving the net proceeds from the share issuances. 

47 

Share Repurchase Program 
 
 The Company s board of trustees authorized the establishment of our share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 300.0 million of our outstanding Class A common shares and up to 250.0 million of our outstanding preferred shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program does not have an expiration date, but may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. All repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an authorized and unissued status. The Operating Partnership funds the repurchases and constructively retires an equivalent number of corresponding Class A units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not repurchase and retire any of our Class A common shares or preferred shares. As of September 30, 2024, we had a remaining repurchase authorization of up to 265.1 million of our outstanding Class A common shares and up to 250.0 million of our outstanding preferred shares under the program. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 As a REIT, we generally are required to distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and any net capital gains) and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and including any net capital gains). The Operating Partnership funds the payment of distributions. We historically used our net operating loss NOL for U.S. federal income tax purposes to reduce our REIT taxable income and have substantially utilized our NOL as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company distributed an aggregate 337.5 million and 283.8 million, respectively, to common shareholders, preferred shareholders and noncontrolling interests on a cash basis. 

Additional Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 Funds from Operations FFO / Core FFO / Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders 
 
 FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate in accordance with the definition approved by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), which defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from sales or impairment of real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 
 Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute this metric by adjusting FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for (1) acquisition and other transaction costs incurred with business combinations and the acquisition or disposition of properties as well as nonrecurring items unrelated to ongoing operations, (2) noncash share-based compensation expense, (3) hurricane-related charges, net, which result in material charges to our single-family property portfolio, (4) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt and (5) the allocation of income to our perpetual preferred shares in connection with their redemption. 
 
 Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute this metric by adjusting Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for (1) Recurring Capital Expenditures that are necessary to help preserve the value and maintain functionality of our properties and (2) capitalized leasing costs incurred during the period. As a portion of our homes are recently developed, acquired and/or renovated, we estimate Recurring Capital Expenditures for our entire portfolio by multiplying (a) current period actual Recurring Capital Expenditures per Same-Home Property by (b) our total number of properties, excluding newly acquired non-stabilized properties and properties classified as held for sale. 
 
 We present FFO attributable to common share and unit holders because we consider this metric to be an important measure of the performance of real estate companies, as do many investors and analysts in evaluating the Company. We believe that FFO attributable to common share and unit holders provides useful information to investors because this metric excludes depreciation, which is included in computing net income and assumes the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions and in response to inflation. We also believe that Core FFO and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders provide useful information to investors because they allow investors to compare our operating performance to prior reporting periods without the effect of certain items that, by nature, are not comparable from period to period. 
 
 FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders are not a substitute for net income or net cash provided by operating activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our operating performance, liquidity 
 
 48 

or ability to pay dividends. These metrics also are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. Because other REITs may not compute these measures in the same manner, they may not be comparable among REITs. 
 
 The following is a reconciliation of the Company s net income attributable to common shareholders, determined in accordance with GAAP, to FFO attributable to common share and unit holders, Core FFO attributable to common share and unit holders and Adjusted FFO attributable to common share and unit holders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income attributable to common shareholders 73,821 74,113 275,252 289,607 Adjustments: Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership 10,333 10,493 38,559 41,140 Gain on sale and impairment of single-family properties and other, net (32,697) (33,335) (145,490) (180,752) Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 1,116 812 3,909 2,380 Depreciation and amortization 119,691 114,863 353,020 340,779 Less: depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets (4,930) (4,476) (14,354) (12,902) FFO attributable to common share and unit holders (1)

 (1) Unit holders include former AH LLC members and other non-affiliates that own Class A units in the Operating Partnership and their OP units are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 10. Shareholders Equity / Partners Capital to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 
 EBITDA / EBITDAre / Adjusted EBITDAre / Fully Adjusted EBITDAre 
 
 EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is used by us and others as a supplemental measure of performance. EBITDAre is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, which we calculate in accordance with the definition approved by NAREIT by adjusting EBITDA for gains and losses from sales or impairments of single-family properties and adjusting for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. Adjusted EBITDAre is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting EBITDAre for (1) acquisition and other transaction costs incurred with business combinations and the acquisition or disposition of properties as well as nonrecurring items unrelated to ongoing operations, (2) noncash share-based compensation expense, (3) hurricane-related charges, net, which result in material charges to our single-family property portfolio , and (4) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt. Fully Adjusted EBITDAre is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting Adjusted EBITDAre for (1) Recurring Capital Expenditures and (2) leasing costs. As a portion of our homes are recently developed, acquired and/or renovated, we estimate Recurring Capital Expenditures for our entire portfolio by multiplying (a) current period actual Recurring Capital Expenditures per Same-Home Property by (b) our total number of properties, excluding newly acquired non-stabilized properties and properties classified as held for sale. We believe these metrics provide useful information to investors because they exclude the impact of various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance.

The following is a reconciliation of net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Fully Adjusted EBITDAre for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (amounts in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income 87,640 88,092 324,269 341,205 Interest expense 43,611 34,381 120,866 105,107 Depreciation and amortization 119,691 114,863 353,020 340,779 EBITDA 250,942 237,336 798,155 787,091 Gain on sale and impairment of single-family properties and other, net (32,697) (33,335) (145,490) (180,752) Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 1,116 812 3,909 2,380 EBITDAre 219,361 204,813 656,574 608,719 Noncash share-based compensation - general and administrative 3,601 4,160 17,999 13,885 Noncash share-based compensation - property management 1,043 953 3,827 3,151 Acquisition, other transaction costs and other 2,605 3,399 8,866 12,650 Hurricane-related charges, net 3,904 3,904 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 5,306 6,323 Adjusted EBITDAre 235,820 213,325 697,493 638,405 Recurring Capital Expenditures (23,088) (23,973) (58,615) (59,079) Leasing costs (995) (792) (2,832) (2,368) Fully Adjusted EBITDAre 211,737 188,560 636,046 576,958 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid down 90.0 million on its revolving credit facility, resulting in no outstanding variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 and therefore no exposure to interest rate risk on its current borrowings. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future, including additional amounts that we may borrow under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 Treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the possible issuance of fixed rate debt. We do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 As further described in Note 13. Fair Value to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this report, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, in anticipation of a potential debt issuance and in order to hedge interest rate risk, the Company entered into two treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 200.0 million based on the 10-year treasury note rates at the time. The treasury locks were designated as cash flow hedging instruments and had an aggregate fair value of 2.6 million recognized as an unrealized gain in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024. If the 10-year treasury note rate were to decrease, there would be a corresponding decrease in the unrealized gain or increase in unrealized loss on our treasury locks. The treasury locks will be settled upon the issuance of debt and the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the term of the debt. 
 
 There have been no other material changes to our market risk from those disclosed in section Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of the 2023 Annual Report.
