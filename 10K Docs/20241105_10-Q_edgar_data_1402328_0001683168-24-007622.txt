subject to material customer concentration risks as it sells its products directly to pharmacies in several Canadian provinces. However,
in Canada provincial governments reimburse patients for their prescription drugs expenditures to various degrees under drug reimbursement
programs, making generic drugs prices highly dependent on governmental policies which may change over time. The most recent negotiations
between the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance and the Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association resulted in updated generic
pricing for certain products which took effect on October 1, 2023. The updated prices are valid for three years and the agreement may
be extended for an additional two years. 

In addition, the
Company is engaged in the development of the following proprietary drugs: 

Adva-27a, a small chemotherapy
 molecule for treatment of pancreatic cancer (IND-enabling studies were paused on November 2, 2023)

 (LNP) targeted for liver cancer 

SBFM-PL4, a protease inhibitor
 for treatment of SARS Coronavirus infections

alternate cashless exercise provision and can only be exercised for cash so long as the Company s registration statement for
the underlying shares remains effective. 

In addition, the
Company granted the underwriter, Aegis Capital Corp. ("Aegis"), a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 15 of the

About Sunshine Biopharma 

We are a pharmaceutical
company offering and researching life-saving medicines in a wide variety of therapeutic areas, including oncology and antivirals. We
operate two wholly owned subsidiaries: (i) Nora Pharma Inc. Nora Pharma ), a Canadian corporation with a portfolio consisting
of 63 generic prescription drugs on the market in Canada, and (ii) Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. Sunshine Canada ), a
Canadian corporation which develops and sells nonprescription over-the-counter OTC products. 

In addition, we
are conducting a proprietary drug development program which is comprised of (i) K1.1 mRNA targeted for liver cancer, (ii) SBFM-PL4, a
PLpro protease inhibitor for SARS Coronavirus infections, and (iii) Adva-27a for pancreatic cancer. Development of the latter has been
paused pending further analysis of unfavorable in vitro results obtained in the second half of 2023. See Drugs in Development 
below. 

History 

We were incorporated
in the State of Colorado on August 31, 2006, and on October 15, 2009, we acquired Sunshine Biopharma Inc. in a transaction classified
as a reverse acquisition. Sunshine Biopharma Inc. held an exclusive license to a new anticancer drug bearing the laboratory name, Adva-27a
(the License Agreement ). Upon completion of the reverse acquisition, we changed our name to Sunshine Biopharma Inc. and
began operating as a pharmaceutical company. 

In December 2015,
we acquired all issued (US Patent Number 8,236,935, and 10,272,065) and pending patents under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029
for the Adva-27a anticancer compound and terminated the License Agreement. Development of Adva-27a has recently been paused pending further
analysis of unexpected in vitro results obtained in the latter part of 2023. See Drugs in Development below. 

In early 2020, we
initiated a new R D project focused on the development of a treatment for COVID-19 and on May 22, 2020, we filed a provisional patent
application in the United States for the new coronavirus treatment. The patent application covers composition subject matter pertaining
to small molecules for inhibition of the main Coronavirus protease, Mpro. On April 30, 2021, we filed a PCT application containing new
research results and extending coverage to include inhibitors for the Coronavirus Papain-Like protease, PLpro. 

In June 2021, we
initiated another R D project in which we set out to determine if certain mRNA molecules can be used as anticancer agents. The data
obtained for mRNA molecules bearing the laboratory name K1.1 became the subject of a new patent application filed in April 2022. 

On October 20,
2022, we acquired Nora Pharma, a Canadian generic pharmaceuticals company based in the greater Montreal area. Nora Pharma has 46
employees and operates in a 23,500 square foot facility certified by Health Canada. Nora Pharma currently has 63 generic
prescription drugs on the market in Canada and is planning to launch 32 additional generic prescription drugs in the remainder of
2024 and 2025.

In
addition to the 63 drugs currently on the market, we have 32 additional
drugs scheduled to be launched in Q4 2024 and in 2025. These new drugs will address various human health areas including cardiovascular,
oncology, gastroenterology, central nervous system, diabetes, urology, endocrinology, anti-infective, and anti-inflammatory. Among the
new drugs to be launched in 2024 is NIOPEG , a biosimilar of NEULASTA . Like NEULASTA , NIOPEG is a long-acting form
of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (filgrastim). It is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection in patients
with non-myeloid malignancies receiving anti-neoplastic therapy. Nora Pharma received Health Canada marketing approval for NIOPEG 
on April 17, 2024. NIOPEG is anticipated to be on the market in Canada in Q4 2024. 

We believe the addition
of these new products to our existing portfolio will strengthen our presence in the Canadian 9.7 billion a year generic drugs market
and provide us with greater access to pharmacies as we become more of a go-to supplier for every-day and specialty medicines.

See Adva-27a Anticancer
Compound below 

Adva-27a Anticancer
Compound 

Adva-27a is a small
molecule designed for the treatment of aggressive forms of cancer. A Topoisomerase II inhibitor, Adva-27a has been shown to be effective
at destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer cells including Pancreatic Cancer cells, Breast Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells and
Uterine Sarcoma cells (Published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432, October 2012). We are the direct owner of all patents
pertaining to Adva-27a including U.S. Patents Number 8,236,935 and 10,272,065. 

In December 2022,
we entered into a research agreement with the Jewish General Hospital JGH ), to conduct the IND-enabling studies of Adva-27a
(the Research Agreement ). In August 2023, we were informed by the JGH that the laboratory test results of the Adva-27a
molecule were not favorable. After conclusion of an internal review of the laboratory results on November 2, 2023, we provided notice
to JGH of termination of the Research Agreement. We have paused the IND-enabling studies of Adva-27a pending a review of the results
and the possibility of chemical modification of the compound to address the suboptimal performance of the molecule in certain studies. 

18 

K1.1 Anticancer
mRNA 

In June 2021, we
initiated a new research project in which we set out to determine if certain mRNA molecules can be used as anti-cancer agents. The data
collected to date have shown that a selected group of mRNA molecules are capable of destroying cancer cells in vitro including multidrug
resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/MDR), ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (OVCAR-3), and pancreatic cancer cells (SUIT-2). Studies using
non-transformed (normal) human cells (HMEC cells) showed that these mRNA molecules had little cytotoxic effects. These new mRNA molecules,
bearing the laboratory name K1.1, are readily adaptable for delivery into patients using the mRNA vaccine technology. In April 2022,
we filed a provisional patent application in the United States covering the subject mRNA molecules. 

In November 2022,
we concluded an agreement with a specialized commercial partner for the purposes of formulating our K1.1 mRNA molecules into lipid nanoparticles LNP for use to conduct xenograft mice studies. The initial results of our xenograft mice studies indicate that our K1.1
mRNA-LNP is effective at reducing the size of liver cancer xenograft tumors in mice. We are currently seeking to confirm these results
by conducting additional xenograft experiments on a broader scale and in more detailed dose-response studies. 

SBFM-PL4 SARS Coronavirus
Treatment 

The initial genome
expression products following infection by Betacoronavirus, the causative agent of COVID-19, are two large polyproteins, referred to
as pp1a and pp1ab. These two polyproteins are cleaved at 15 specific sites by two virus encoded proteases, called Mpro and PLpro, to
generate 16 different non-structural proteins essential for viral replication. Mpro and PLpro represent attractive anti-viral drug development
targets as they play a central role in the early stages of viral replication. PLpro is of particular interest as a therapeutic target
in that, in addition to processing essential viral proteins, it is also responsible for suppression of the human immune system making
the virus more life-threatening. PLpro is present only in Betacoronaviruses, the subgroup of Coronaviruses represented by the highly
pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. 

Our Anti-Coronavirus
research effort has been focused on developing an inhibitor of PLpro and, on May 22, 2020, we filed a patent application in the United
States covering composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the Coronavirus PLpro as well as Mpro. 

In February 2022,
we expanded our PLpro inhibitors research effort by entering into a research agreement with the University of Arizona for the purposes
of conducting research focused on determining the in vivo safety, pharmacokinetics, and dose selection properties of three University
of Arizona owned PLpro inhibitors, to be followed by efficacy testing in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the Research Project ).
Under the agreement, the University of Arizona granted us a first option to negotiate a commercial, royalty-bearing license for all intellectual
property developed by University of Arizona under the Research Project. In addition, we and the University of Arizona have entered into
an option agreement (the Option Agreement whereby we were granted a first option to negotiate a royalty-bearing commercial
license for the underlying technology of the Research Project. On September 13, 2022, we exercised our options, and on February 24, 2023,
we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the University of Arizona for all of the technology related to the Research
Project. 

We have recently
broadened our objective to include the development of an injectable drug candidate of first-in-class PLpro inhibitor to treat SARS-CoV2
and potentially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in patients who could not use Paxlovid, Molnupiravir, or Remdesivir, due to concerns
about drug interactions and possible rebound infections and other side effects. 

19 

Intellectual Property 

We are the sole
owner of all rights pertaining to Adva-27a. These patent rights are covered by PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029. The patent applications
filed under these two PCT's have been issued in the United States under US Patent Number 8,236,935 and 10,272,065. 

On May 22, 2020,
we filed a provisional patent application in the United States for a new treatment for Coronavirus infections. Our patent application
covers composition subject matter pertaining to small molecules for inhibition of the main Coronavirus protease, Mpro, an enzyme that
is essential for viral replication. The patent application has a priority date of May 22, 2020. On April 30, 2021, we filed a PCT application
containing new research results and extending coverage to include the Coronavirus Papain-Like protease, PLpro. The priority date of May
22, 2020 has been maintained in the newly filed PCT application. 

On April 20, 2022,
we filed a provisional patent application in the United States covering mRNA molecules capable of destroying cancer cells in vitro. The
patent application contains composition and utility subject matter pertaining to the structure and sequence of the relevant mRNA molecules. 

Effective February
24, 2023, we became the exclusive, worldwide licensee of the University of Arizona for three (3) patents related to small molecules which
inhibit the Coronavirus protease, PLpro. 

Our wholly owned
subsidiary, Nora Pharma, owns 152 DIN s issued by Health Canada for prescription drugs currently on the market in Canada. These
DIN s were secured through in-licenses or cross-licenses from international manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products. 

In addition, we
are the owner of four (4) NPN s issued by Health Canada including (i) NPN 80089663 which authorizes us to manufacture and sell
our in-house developed OTC product, Essential 9, (ii) NPN 80093432 which authorizes us to manufacture and sell the OTC product,
Calcium-Vitamin D under the brand name Essential Calcium-Vitamin D, (iii) NPN 80125047 which authorizes us to manufacture and sell the
OTC product, L-Citrulline, and (iv) NPN 80127436 which authorizes us to manufacture and sell the OTC product, Taurine. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison
of results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 8,435,178 in sales, compared to 5,957,668 for the three months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 2,477,510, or 42 . The increase is attributable to expanded marketing and sales efforts by our wholly owned
subsidiary, Nora Pharma. The direct cost for generating these sales was 5,569,027 (66 for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to 3,967,412 (67 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our gross profit grew to 2,866,151 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 1,990,256 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

General and administrative
expenses during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were 3,972,504, compared to 2,769,730 during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,202,774. The increase was due to increases in accounting fees 68,422), consulting 253,251),
marketing 40,848), and salaries 949,473). The increase in salaries was due to the hiring of two (2) new employees and a bonus paid
to the CEO of the Company. The only expense category that saw a decrease was R D, which was reduced by 111,650. Overall, we incurred
a loss of 1,106,353 from our operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of 779,474 from our operations
in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

20 

In addition, we
had interest income of 108,614 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net interest income of 168,904 during
the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of less interest earned on cash on hand. 

As a result, we
incurred a net loss of 1,197,803 0.94 per share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 651,482 50.72 per share) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Comparison of results
of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 25,279,291, compared to revenue of 16,412,586 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023, an increase of 8,866,705, or 54 . The increase is attributable to expanded marketing and sales efforts by our wholly owned
subsidiary, Nora Pharma. The direct cost for generating these revenues was 17,702,546 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (70 ),
compared to 10,641,461 (65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the cost of sales in the nine-month
period of 2024 is related to greater retailer allowances offered to gain access to new regional markets. Our gross profit increased to
 7,576,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gross profit of 5,771,125 for the same period in 2023. 

General and administrative
expenses during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, were 11,351,144, compared to 9,369,203 during the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,981,941. The increase was a result of increases in accounting 263,791), legal 170,871),
marketing 234,129), office costs 781,912), and salaries 838,937). The two expense categories that saw a decrease were consulting 169,369), and R D 254,872). Overall, we incurred a loss of 3,774,399 from our operations in the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024, compared to a loss from operations of 3,598,078 in the similar period of 2023. 

In addition, we
had interest income of 396,453 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest income of 517,163 during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to the Company having less cash on hand. 

As a result, we
incurred a net loss of 2,975,904 13.61 per share) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 3,256,020 265.71 per share) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

As of September
30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 12,206,655. 

Net cash used in
operating activities was 9,123,898 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6,085,435 during the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was a result of increased business activities by Nora Pharma. 

Cash flows used
in investing activities were 1,789,312 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 386,920 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase was the result of cash invested in Nora Pharma to finance increase in inventory and expansion of operations
and product line. 

Cash flows provided
by financing activities were 7,235,518 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,456,106 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of the approximately 10 million financing event completed in February
2024, compared to an approximately 5 million financing event completed in May 2023. 

We are not generating
adequate revenues from our operations to fully implement our business plan as set forth herein. We believe our existing cash on hand
will be sufficient to fund our pharmaceuticals sales operations and research and development activities for the next 24 months. There
is no assurance our estimates will be accurate. We currently have no committed sources of capital and we anticipate that we will need
to raise additional capital in the future, including for further research and development activities and possibly clinical trials, as
well as expansion of our generic pharmaceuticals operations. Additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at
all.

Critical Accounting
Estimates 

The discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
