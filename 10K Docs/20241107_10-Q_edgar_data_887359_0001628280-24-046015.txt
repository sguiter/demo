 commercial-stage products in the U.S., MACI , Epicel and NexoBrid . 
 
 MACI (autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane) is an autologous cellularized scaffold product that is indicated for the repair of symptomatic, single or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults. Since MACI s commercial launch, a treating surgeon has been able to use MACI to treat a patient through an open surgical procedure. In August 2024, however, the U.S. Food Drug Administration FDA approved a supplemental Biologics License Application sBLA expanding the MACI indication to add instructions for the arthroscopic delivery of MACI to the product s approved labeling. MACI Arthro allows surgeons to evaluate and prepare the cartilage defect site as well as deliver the MACI implant through small incisions using custom-designed arthroscopic instruments developed by the Company MACI Arthro instruments ). MACI Arthro became commercially available in the United States during the third quarter of 2024 and the Company began selling the MACI Arthro instruments at that time. 
 
 Epicel (cultured epidermal autografts) is a permanent skin replacement for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with deep-dermal or full-thickness burns comprising greater than or equal to 30 percent of total body surface area TBSA ). The Company also holds an exclusive license from MediWound Ltd. MediWound for North American rights to NexoBrid (anacaulase-bcdb), a topically administered biological orphan product containing proteolytic enzymes, which is indicated for the removal of eschar in adult and pediatric patients with deep partial-thickness and/or full thickness thermal burns. Following the FDA s approval of a Biologics License Application for NexoBrid in December 2022, the Company began commercial sales of NexoBrid in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The Company operates its business primarily in the U.S. in reportable segment the research, product development, manufacture and distribution of cellular therapies and specialty biologics for use in the treatment of specific conditions. The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the life sciences industry including, but not limited to, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, commercialization of existing and new products, and compliance with FDA regulations and approval requirements, as well as the ability to grow the Company s business through appropriate commercial strategies. 
 
 The Ongoing Military Conflicts in the Middle East 
 
 In May 2019, the Company entered into exclusive license and supply agreements with MediWound, under which MediWound manufactures and supplies NexoBrid to the U.S. market on a unit price basis. MediWound develops and manufactures NexoBrid, in part, at its facilities in Yavne, Israel. 
 
 The Company continues to monitor the ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East region involving Israel, and the Company is in close communication with MediWound leadership. MediWound s NexoBrid manufacturing operations are continuing and, as of the date of this disclosure, MediWound does not anticipate a material disruption to its ongoing supply of commercial NexoBrid to the United States. To the extent the conflicts in the Middle East region intensify or expand to include additional countries or militant groups and MediWound s facilities in Israel are damaged or destroyed, travel to and from Israel is halted or inhibited, or significant key MediWound operational personnel are called to military service, MediWound s ability to continue to supply NexoBrid to the U.S. market could be disrupted. As of the date of this report, the Company maintains an ample supply of NexoBrid at its U.S.-based third-party logistics provider. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern and contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and had a net loss of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of million and investments of million as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects that cash from the sales of its products and existing cash, cash equivalents, investments, and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to support the Company s current operations through at least 12 months from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. If revenues decline for a sustained period, the Company may need to access additional capital; however, the

 specialty pharmacies, Orsini Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Orsini and AllCare Plus Pharmacy, Inc. AllCare to distribute MACI in a manner in which the Company retains the credit and collection risk from the end customer. The Company pays each specialty pharmacy a fee in each instance when it dispenses MACI for use in treating a patient. Both Orsini and AllCare perform collection activities to collect payment from customers. In addition, the Company sells MACI directly to hospitals pursuant to an agreed upon purchase order and to a distributor, DMS Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. DMS at a contracted rate for the treatment of patients at military facilities throughout the U.S. The Company engages a third party to provide services in connection with a patient support program to manage patient cases and to ensure that complete and correct billing information is provided to the insurers and hospitals. 
 
 Prior authorization and confirmation of coverage level by the patient s private insurance plan, hospital or government payer is a prerequisite to the shipment of a MACI implant to a patient. The Company recognizes product revenue from sales of all MACI implants upon delivery at which time the customer obtains control of the implant and the claim is billable. The total consideration that the Company expects to collect in exchange for MACI implants (the Transaction Price may be fixed or variable. Direct sales to hospitals or distributors are recorded at a contracted price, and there are typically no forms of variable consideration. 
 
 When the Company sells MACI through its specialty pharmacies, the Company is typically reimbursed by a third-party insurer or government payer, subject to a patient co-pay amount. Reimbursements from third-party insurers and government payers vary by patient and payer and are based on either contracted rates, publicly available rates, fee schedules or past payer precedents. Net product revenue is recognized net of estimated contractual allowances, which considers historical collection experience from both the payer and patient, denial rates and the terms of the Company s contractual arrangements. The Company estimates expected collections for these transactions using the portfolio approach. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale for its estimate of the amount of consideration that will not be collected. In addition, potential credit risk exposure has been evaluated for the Company s accounts receivable in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses . The Company assesses risk and determines a loss percentage by pooling accounts receivable based on similar risk characteristics. The loss percentage is calculated through the use of forecasts that are based on current and historical economic and financial information. This loss percentage was applied to the accounts receivables as of September 30, 2024. The total allowance for uncollectible consideration as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. Changes to the estimate of the amount of consideration that will not be collected could have a material impact on the revenue recognized. A basis points change to the estimated uncollectible percentage could result in an approximately million decrease or increase in the revenue recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 square feet of manufacturing, laboratory and office space in Burlington, Massachusetts (the Premises ), which is currently being constructed. Once constructed, the Premises will serve as the Company s new corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility. 
 
 In April 2023, in connection with the Burlington Lease, the Company entered into a construction escrow agreement (the Construction Escrow Agreement with the facility s landlord and an escrow agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Construction Escrow Agreement, in April 2023, the Company began funding, into an escrow account maintained by the escrow agent, a portion of its share of tenant improvement construction costs at the facility, which are designated as restricted cash. At the same time, the facility s landlord began funding a portion of its tenant improvement allowance through a separate escrow account. The Company funded the remaining of its required cost amount, or approximately million, with cash on hand, pursuant to the Construction Escrow Agreement in April 2024. 
 
 The term of the Burlington Lease began on June 1, 2023 (the Commencement Date ), when the Company gained control of and commenced tenant improvement work at the Premises. The Company s obligation to pay rent for the Premises began on July 1, 2024 (the Rent Commencement Date ). The initial term of the Lease is months following the Rent Commencement Date. The Company has a -time option to extend the term of the Lease for an additional years, exercisable under certain conditions and at a market rate determined in accordance with the Burlington Lease. 
 
 The annual base rent of the Burlington Lease is initially per square foot per year, subject to annual increases of . Monthly contractual payments are expected to range from million to million. Additionally, the Company is responsible for reimbursing the landlord for the Company s share of the Premises property taxes and certain other operating expenses. The Burlington Lease also provides for a tenant improvement allowance from the landlord in an amount equal to per square foot of the Premises, or approximately million. The tenant improvement allowance is being used towards the design and construction of the tenant improvements made to the Premises, subject to the terms set forth in the Burlington Lease. 
 
 The Company was not involved in the initial construction of the core and shell of the building. On June 1, 2023, the Company gained control of the Premises to begin construction of its tenant improvements. As such, the corresponding right-of-use asset and lease liability of million was recorded on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet. As there was not an implicit rate within the lease available, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate of , based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The lease term of years does not include the lease extension option, as the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise that option. The Company has determined that certain improvements to the Premises are landlord-owned improvements and costs incurred for these improvements are accounted for as a variable lease payment. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset related to landlord-owned improvements incurred of approximately million. 
 
 In January 2022, in connection with the execution of the Burlington Lease, the Company issued a letter of credit collateralized by cash deposits of approximately million. Subsequent to the execution of the Revolving Credit Agreement on July 29, 2022 (see Note 8, Revolving Credit Agreement for further details), the letter of credit is issued under the sub-facility limit of the Revolving Credit Agreement. Such letter of credit shall be reduced to approximately million and million at the conclusion of the third and sixth lease years, respectively, provided certain conditions set forth in the Burlington Lease are satisfied. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, lease expense of less than million was recorded related to short-term leases. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of operating lease expense and million and million, respectively, for the same period in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized less than million of financing lease expense .

The Company recorded the million milestone for the licensing rights to commercially sell NexoBrid in the U.S. as an intangible asset as of December 31, 2022. The million milestone payment was paid to MediWound in February of 2023. 
 
 Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay MediWound up to million, which is contingent upon meeting certain sales milestones. The first sales milestone payment of million would be triggered when annual net sales of NexoBrid or improvements to NexoBrid in North America exceed million. As of September 30, 2024, the sales milestone payments are not yet probable and therefore, not recorded as a liability. The Company also pays MediWound tiered royalties on net sales ranging from mid-high single-digit to mid-teen percentages, subject to customary reductions. Pursuant to the terms of the Company s supply agreement with MediWound, MediWound is manufacturing, and will continue to manufacture, NexoBrid for the Company on a unit price basis, which may be increased pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement. MediWound is obligated to supply the Company with NexoBrid for sale in North America on an exclusive basis for the first of the term of the supply agreement. Under the supply agreement, the Company possesses the option to extend the initial term of the agreement by an additional months, which it did in May 2022. After the initial term, the Company may extend the supply agreement on an annual basis for up to additional years, at its sole discretion. Under the supply agreement, the Company is permitted to establish an alternate source of supply in certain circumstances, including the event of a supply failure. 
 
 Additionally, beginning in 2020, BARDA procured quantities of NexoBrid from MediWound for use as a medical countermeasure in the event of a mass casualty emergency in the U.S. involving thermal burns. The initial, quarterly, procurement of NexoBrid by BARDA under its agreement with MediWound was completed during the third quarter of 2022. As a part of BARDA s commitment to procure NexoBrid, the Company received a percentage of gross profit for sales directly to

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 Vericel Corporation is a fully-integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company and a leading provider of advanced therapies for the sports medicine and severe burn care markets. Whether we are treating damaged cartilage or severe burns, we provide advanced therapies to repair serious injuries and restore lives. Our highly differentiated portfolio of cell therapy and specialty biologic products combines innovations in biology with medical technologies. We were among the first companies to achieve commercial success in the complex field of cell therapies with treatments that use tissue engineering to regenerate skin and healthy knee cartilage. We currently market two U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved autologous cell therapy products and one FDA-approved specialty biologic product in the U.S. MACI is an autologous cellularized scaffold product indicated for the repair of symptomatic, single or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults. Epicel is a permanent skin replacement Humanitarian Use Device HUD for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with deep-dermal or full-thickness burns comprising greater than or equal to 30 percent of total body surface area TBSA ). We also hold an exclusive license from MediWound Ltd. MediWound for North American rights to NexoBrid (anacaulase-bcdb), a topically-administered biological orphan product containing proteolytic enzymes, which is indicated for the removal of eschar in adult and pediatric patients with deep partial-thickness and/or full-thickness thermal burns. 
 
 The Ongoing Military Conflicts in the Middle East 
 
 In May 2019, we entered into exclusive license and supply agreements with MediWound, under which MediWound manufactures and supplies NexoBrid to the U.S. market on a unit price basis. MediWound develops and manufactures NexoBrid, in part, at its facilities in Yavne, Israel. 
 
 We continue to monitor the ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East region involving Israel, and we are in close communication with MediWound leadership. MediWound s NexoBrid manufacturing operations are continuing and, as of the date of this disclosure, MediWound does not anticipate a material disruption to its ongoing supply of commercial NexoBrid to the United States. To the extent the conflicts in the Middle East region intensify or expand to include additional countries or militant groups and MediWound s facilities in Israel are damaged or destroyed, travel to and from Israel is halted or inhibited, or significant key MediWound operational personnel are called to military service, MediWound s ability to continue to supply NexoBrid to the U.S. market could be disrupted. As of the date of this report, we maintain an ample supply of NexoBrid at our U.S.-based third-party logistics provider. 
 
 Manufacturing 
 
 We have a cell manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is used for U.S. manufacturing and distribution of MACI and Epicel. The manufacturing process for NexoBrid is conducted by MediWound, primarily at manufacturing locations in Israel. Certain raw materials utilized in NexoBrid s manufacture, including the supply of the active ingredient bromelain, are sourced from Taiwan. 
 
 Product Portfolio 
 
 Our marketed products include two FDA-approved autologous cell therapies and one FDA-approved specialty biologic product. MACI is a third-generation autologous cellularized scaffold product indicated for the repair of symptomatic, single or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults; and Epicel is a permanent skin replacement for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with deep-dermal or full-thickness burns comprising greater than or equal to 30 percent TBSA. Both autologous cell therapy products are currently manufactured and marketed in the U.S. NexoBrid is a topically-administered biological orphan product containing proteolytic enzymes that is indicated for eschar removal in adult and pediatric patients with deep partial-thickness and/or full-thickness burns. We hold exclusive license and supply agreements with MediWound to commercialize NexoBrid in North America. The Company operates its business primarily in the U.S. in one reportable segment the research, product development, manufacture and distribution of cellular therapies and specialty biologics for use in the treatment of specific conditions.

 MACI 
 
 MACI is a third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation ACI product indicated for the repair of symptomatic, single or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults. 
 
 Our target audiences are orthopedic surgeons who self-identify and/or have formal specialty training in sports medicine, and a subpopulation of general orthopedic surgeons who perform a high volume of cartilage repair procedures involving the knee. Our MACI commercial team consists of individual sales representatives that regularly engage with our target audience. The team is divided into geographic regions, each managed by a Regional Sales Director and led by a Senior Vice President of Sales. Most private payers have a medical policy that covers treatment with MACI with the top 30 largest commercial payers having a formal medical policy for MACI or ACI in general. With respect to private commercial payers that have not yet approved a medical policy for MACI, we often obtain approval on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 MACI consists of autologous cultured chondrocytes, which are human-derived cells that are obtained from the patient s own cartilage, and which are seeded onto resorbable Type I/III collagen membrane. Since MACI s commercial launch, a treating surgeon has been able to use MACI to treat a patient through an open surgical procedure. In August 2024, however, the FDA approved a supplemental Biologics License Application sBLA expanding the MACI indication to add instructions for the arthroscopic delivery of MACI to the product s approved labeling, permitting the repair of single or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee up to 4 cm 2 in size via that approach. MACI Arthro TM provides a less invasive technique compared to the current approach and allows surgeons to evaluate, prepare and treat the cartilage defect, and deliver the MACI implant, under direct arthroscopic visualization using specialized and custom-designed instruments (the MACI Arthro instruments through small incisions or portals. The arthroscopic delivery of MACI could increase the ease of MACI s use for physicians and may reduce both the length of the procedure as well as procedure-induced trauma, ultimately resulting in a reduction of a patient s post-operative pain and accelerating a patient s recovery. MACI Arthro became commercially available in the United States during the third quarter of 2024 and we began selling the MACI Arthro instruments at that time. In conjunction with the launch of MACI Arthro, we have expanded our target surgeon base from 5,000 to 7,000 to include orthopedic surgeons that perform high volumes of knee cartilage repair surgeries, predominantly through arthroscopic procedures. 
 
 We also are evaluating the feasibility and potential market opportunity involved in delivering MACI treatment to patients suffering from cartilage damage in the ankle. We believe that this potential lifecycle enhancement and indication expansion for MACI will require conducting an additional randomized clinical trial concerning the product s use in the ankle and we are on track to initiate a MACI Ankle clinical trial beginning in 2025. If approved, we believe MACI s expansion into the ankle will be a significant long-term growth driver for the product, beginning in the latter half of the decade. 
 
 Epicel 
 
 Epicel is a permanent skin replacement for deep-dermal or full-thickness burns comprising greater than or equal to 30 percent TBSA. Epicel is regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research CBER of the FDA under medical device authorities, and is the only FDA-approved cultured epidermal autograft product available for large total surface area burns in both adult and pediatric patients. Epicel was designated as a HUD in 1998 and a Humanitarian Device Exemption HDE application for the product was submitted in 1999. HUDs are devices that are intended for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 8,000 individuals annually in the U.S., and certain HUDs are restricted by the amount which a manufacturer may charge for its use. 
 
 Epicel is not price-restricted in this manner because on February 18, 2016, the FDA approved our HDE supplement to revise the labeled indications of use for Epicel to specifically include pediatric patients, thus allowing Epicel to be sold for profit. The revised product label also now specifies that the probable benefit of Epicel, mainly related to survival, was demonstrated in two Epicel clinical experience databases and a physician-sponsored study comparing outcomes in patients with large burns treated with Epicel relative to standard care. 
 
 NexoBrid 
 
 Our portfolio of commercial-stage products also includes NexoBrid (anacaulase-bcdb), a topically-administered biological orphan product containing proteolytic enzymes, for which the FDA approved a BLA in December 2022 permitting the product s use for the removal of eschar in adults with deep partial-thickness and/or full thickness thermal burns. Subsequently, in August 2024, the FDA approved a sBLA expanding NexoBrid s indication to include pediatric patients.

Table of Contents 

 NexoBrid is approved in the European Union EU and other international markets and has been designated as an orphan biologic in the U.S., EU and other international markets. NexoBrid has the potential to change the standard of care for eschar removal with respect to hospitalized burn patients and treat a significant addressable market in the U.S. With respect to NexoBrid, of the approximately 40,000 people that are hospitalized in the U.S. each year for burn-related injuries, the majority, over 30,000, have thermal burns and will likely require some level of eschar removal. NexoBrid s FDA approval expands our burn care franchise s total addressable market, which will permit us to treat a significantly larger segment of hospitalized burn patients than with Epicel alone. The expansion of our target addressable market supports a broader commercial footprint, and we believe that this may help drive both increased NexoBrid use as well as increased Epicel awareness throughout the burn care space. Both our Epicel and NexoBrid products are serviced by our burn care field force, which consists of individual sales and clinical representatives that regularly engage with our target audience. The team is divided into geographical regions, each managed by a Regional Sales Director and led by a Vice President of National Burn Care Sales. 
 
 In May 2019, we entered into exclusive license and supply agreements with MediWound to commercialize NexoBrid in North America. The manufacturing process for NexoBrid is conducted by MediWound, primarily at manufacturing locations in Israel. Certain raw materials utilized in NexoBrid s manufacture, including the supply of the active ingredient bromelain are sourced from Taiwan. 

Results of Operations

 Comparison of the Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Total Revenue 
 
 Revenue by product is as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change MACI 44,656 37,589 7,067 18.8 128,973 108,114 20,859 19.3 Epicel 12,184 7,394 4,790 64.8 30,606 23,808 6,798 28.6 NexoBrid 1,065 598 467 78.1 2,269 598 1,671 279.4 Total revenue 57,905 45,581 12,324 27.0 161,848 132,520 29,328 22.1

Table of Contents 

 Total revenue increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was driven primarily by MACI volume and price growth, in addition to burn care revenue from higher Epicel and NexoBrid volume. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Sales of MACI implants have historically experienced a level of seasonality throughout the year. In the last five years through 2023, MACI sales volumes from the first through the fourth quarter on average represented 20 (18 -22 range), 22 (16 -24 range), 23 (21 -26 range) and 35 (33 -38 range) respectively, of total annual volumes. Historically, MACI orders are normally stronger in the fourth quarter due to several factors including the satisfaction by patients of insurance deductible limits and the time of year patients prefer to start rehabilitation. Due to the low incidence and variable occurrence of severe burns encompassing a large total body surface area, Epicel revenue has inherent variability from quarter-to-quarter and does not exhibit significant seasonality. Although U.S. sales of NexoBrid only began in September 2023, and we are still relatively early in its commercial launch, we do not expect NexoBrid revenue to experience significant seasonality given its emergent use in treating severe burns. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was driven by revenue growth across all products, combined with our primarily fixed manufacturing cost structure which consists mainly of labor and facility costs. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 The following table summarizes research and development expenses, which include materials, professional fees and an allocation of employee-related salary and fringe benefit costs for our research and development projects: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change MACI 4,345 4,020 325 8.1 14,635 10,412 4,223 40.6 Epicel 1,138 890 248 27.9 3,463 2,975 488 16.4 NexoBrid 610 766 (156) (20.4) 1,776 2,754 (978) (35.5) Total research and development expenses 6,093 5,676 417 7.3 19,874 16,141 3,733 23.1 
 
 Research and development expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher headcount and employee expenses. 
 
 Research and development expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher headcount and employee expenses, as well as increased MACI arthroscopic development program costs in 2024. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 38.0 million, compared to 30.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher headcount and employee expenses, including stock compensation and sales incentive compensation, and an increase in marketing programs and events, including to support the MACI arthroscopic launch. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 107.7 million, compared to 90.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher headcount and employee expenses, including stock compensation and sales incentive compensation, an increase in marketing programs and events, including to support the MACI arthroscopic launch, and the lease expense associated with the Burlington Lease.

 Total Other Income 
 
 The increase in other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 was due to an increase in interest income primarily due to fluctuations in the rates of return on our investments in various marketable debt securities and money market funds. 
 
 Stock-based Compensation Expense 
 
 Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is summarized in the following table: 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Cost of product sales 762 660 102 15.5 2,914 2,341 573 24.5 Research and development 1,095 892 203 22.8 3,281 2,862 419 14.6 Selling, general and administrative 7,367 6,372 995 15.6 22,383 20,213 2,170 10.7 Total non-cash stock-based compensation expense 9,224 7,924 1,300 16.4 28,578 25,416 3,162 12.4 
 
 The increase in stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, was due primarily to fluctuations in stock prices and the mix of service-based options and restricted stock units, which impacts the fair value of the options and restricted stock units awarded and the expense recognized in the period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 35,921 25,225 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (64,383) 4,958 Net cash provided by financing activities 11,946 2,311 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (16,516) 32,494 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 
 Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 70.4 million, short-term investments totaled 48.1 million and long-term investments totaled 32.9 million as of September 30, 2024. The 35.9 million of cash provided by operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of non-cash charges of 28.6 million related to stock-based compensation expense, 5.1 million of operating lease amortization and 4.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense, offset by a net loss of 9.4 million and a net increase of 7.8 million related to movements in our working capital accounts.

 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the result of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of 17.3 million, partially offset by the payment of employee withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock units of 5.3 million. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan of 4.6 million, partially offset by the payment of employee withholding taxes related to the vesting of restricted stock units of 2.3 million. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Since our acquisition of MACI and Epicel in 2014, our primary focus has been to invest in our existing commercial business with the goal of growing revenue. We have raised significant funds in order to advance and complete our product development and product life-cycle management programs and to market and commercialize our products, including NexoBrid. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash received through MACI, Epicel and NexoBrid sales, debt, and public and private sales of our equity securities. In the future, we may finance our operations through the sales of equity securities, revolver borrowings or other debt financings, in addition to cash generated from operations. 
 
 We believe that our current cash on hand, cash equivalents, investments, and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to support our current operations through at least 12 months from the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. Our actual cash requirements may differ from projections and will depend on many factors, including the level and pace of future research and development efforts, the scope and results of ongoing and potential clinical trials, the costs involved in filing, prosecuting and enforcing patents, the need for additional manufacturing capacity, competing technological and market developments, global macroeconomic conditions, costs associated with possible acquisitions or development of complementary business activities, and the cost to market our products. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Sources of Capital 
 
 On July 29, 2022, we entered into a 150.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit agreement by and among the Company, the other loan parties thereto, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent (the Revolving Credit Agreement ). We have no immediate plans to borrow under the Revolving Credit Agreement, but we may use the facility for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there are no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement, and we are in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements. See Note 8, Revolving Credit Agreement in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further details.
