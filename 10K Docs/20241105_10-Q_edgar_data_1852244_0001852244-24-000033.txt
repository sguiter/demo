Business Overview 
 
 GXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries GXO, the Company, our or we ), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world and a foremost innovator in the industry. We provide our customers with high-value-added warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services differentiated by our ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at scale. Our customers rely on us to move their goods with high efficiency through their supply chains from the moment goods arrive at our warehouses through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes many blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand, with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services. 
 
 Our business model is asset-light and historically resilient in cycles, with high returns, strong free cash flow and visibility into revenue and earnings. The vast majority of our contracts with customers are long-term in nature, and our warehouse lease arrangements generally align with contract length. The Company has both fixed-price contracts (closed book or hybrid contracts) and cost-plus contracts (open book contracts). Most of our customer contracts contain both fixed and variable components. The fixed component is typically designed to cover warehouse, technology and equipment costs, while the variable component is determined based on expected volumes and associated labor costs. Under fixed-price contracts, the Company agrees to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent the Company s actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, the Company will generate more or less profit. Cost-plus contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during the performance of the contract plus a specified margin.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our ability to fund our operations and anticipated capital needs is reliant upon the generation of cash from operations, supplemented as necessary by periodic utilization of our revolving credit facility and factoring programs. Our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund our operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of borrowings and strategic business development transactions. The timing and magnitude of our new contract start-ups can vary and may positively or negatively impact our cash flows. We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements and capital structure in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of 548 million, restricted cash in Other long-term assets of 21 million and we had 959 million of borrowing capacity, net of letters of credit under our revolving credit facilities . In October and November 2024, we deposited an additional 34 million 38 million as of September 30, 2024) of restricted cash in connection with the investigation by the Italian authorities. We have agreed to deposit an additional 33 million 37 million as of September 30, 2024) of restricted cash in December 2024 and January 2025. We believe that our cas h and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations, the revolving credit facilities, and the use of our factoring programs will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in Critical Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Information related to new accounting standards is included in Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To reduce our exposure to market risk associated with interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates risks, we enter into various derivative instruments. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our long-term debt portfolio, excluding finance leases and other debt, consisted of 1.9 billion fixed-rate notes and 585 million variable-rate term loans based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). For our variable-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert 250 million of variable-rate U.S. dollar USD denominated debt into USD-denominated fixed-rate debt. Additionally, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements to convert 250 million of variable-rate debt from SOFR to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate Euribor ). As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 1 increase in SOFR and Euribor would have increased our interest expense by approximately 3 million. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 A significant proportion of our net assets and income are in non-USD currencies, primarily the British pound sterling GBP and the Euro EUR ). We are exposed to currency risk from potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. Consequently, the depreciation of the EUR or the GBP relative to the USD could adversely impact our financial results. 
 
 We entered into cross-currency swap and forward agreements to manage our foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting a portion of the fixed-rate USD-denominated debt, including the interest payments, to fixed-rate EUR-denominated debt and a portion of the floating-rate USD-denominated loans, including the interest payments, to floating-rate EUR-denominated debt. We use foreign currency options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of a reduction in the value of earnings from our operations that use the EUR or GBP as their functional currency. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, a uniform 10 strengthening in the value of the USD relative to the EUR would have decreased our net assets by approximately 121 million, net of hedging. As of September 30, 2024, a uniform 10 strengthening in the value of the USD relative to the GBP would have decreased our net assets by approximately 81 million, net of hedging. These theoretical calculations assume that an instantaneous, parallel shift in exchange rates occurs, which is not consistent with the history of foreign currency markets. 
 
 See Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective as of such time such that the information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission SEC reports is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to the Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 Other than the design and implementation of internal controls related to the acquisition of PFSweb, Inc., there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 See Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of our legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There are no material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in Risk Factors contained in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as set forth below. 
 
 Risks Related to the Wincanton Acquisition 
 
 On February 29, 2024, the Company and the board of directors of Wincanton plc Wincanton reached an agreement on the terms of a cash offer by the Company for Wincanton. On April 10, 2024, the Wincanton shareholders approved the Wincanton Acquisition and, on April 29, 2024, the Company completed the Wincanton Acquisition. The Wincanton Acquisition was notified to the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom (the CMA which initiated its formal review of the transaction on September 9, 2024. Since completion of the transaction, Wincanton has been held separate from the Company pursuant to the terms of a customary initial enforcement order imposed by the CMA while it carries out its review. On November 1, 2024, the CMA announced that it intends to refer the Wincanton Acquisition for an in-depth Phase 2 investigation unless acceptable undertakings are agreed between the Company and the CMA by November 15, 2024. The Company is reviewing the decision and will continue to engage constructively and collaboratively with the CMA. As a result, the possible timing and likelihood of the CMA s investigation is uncertain, and the CMA may require, in connection with granting its approval of the transaction, divestitures or ongoing restrictions on the operation of the combined business, each of which could have a material impact on the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combination. Any delay in the receipt of regulatory approval from the CMA for the Wincanton Acquisition will result in greater transaction costs and professional fees. The success of the Wincanton Acquisition will depend, in significant part, on our ability to successfully integrate Wincanton and its subsidiaries, grow the revenue of the combined company and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies from the combination.
