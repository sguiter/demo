Total revenue 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million in MRD service revenue related to Medicare reimbursements resulting from our determination that the likelihood of additional testing for specific patients was remote and million in Immune Medicine service revenue related to cancelled customer contracts. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized million in MRD service revenue related to Medicare reimbursements resulting from our determination that the likelihood of additional testing for specific patients was remote and from cancelled customer contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million in MRD service revenue related to Medicare reimbursements resulting from our determination that the likelihood of additional testing for specific patients was remote and million in Immune Medicine service revenue related to cancelled customer contracts . During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized million in revenue related to Medicare reimbursements resulting from our determination that the likelihood of additional testing for specific patients was remote, cancelled customer contracts and changes in estimates of total samples to be provided under certain of our agreements, million of which was recognized as MRD service revenue and million of which was recognized as Immune Medicine service revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we could receive up to an additional million in milestone payments in future periods if certain regulatory approvals are obtained by our customers therapeutics in connection with MRD data generated from our MRD product. Genentech Collaboration Agreement In December 2018, we entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech (the Genentech Agreement to leverage our capability to develop cellular therapies in oncology. Subsequent to receipt of regulatory approval in January 2019, we received a non-refundable, upfront payment of million in February 2019. Additionally, we received a million milestone in 2023. We may be eligible to receive billion over time, including payments of up to million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones, up to million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and up to million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. In addition, we are separately able to receive tiered royalties at a rate ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens on aggregate worldwide net sales of products arising from the strategic collaboration, subject to certain reductions, with aggregate minimum floors. Under the Genentech Agreement, we are pursuing two product development pathways for novel T cell therapeutic products in which Genentech intends to use T cell receptors TCRs screened by our immune medicine platform to engineer and manufacture cellular medicines: Shared Products. The shared products will use off-the-shelf TCRs identified against cancer antigens shared among patients Shared Products ). 

 Personalized Product. The personalized product will use patient-specific TCRs identified by real-time screening of TCRs against cancer antigens in each patient Personalized Product ). 

 Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we granted Genentech exclusive worldwide licenses to develop and commercialize TCR-based cellular therapies in the field of oncology, including licenses to existing shared antigen data packages. Additionally, Genentech has the right to determine which product candidates to further develop for commercialization purposes. We determined that this arrangement meets the criteria set forth in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements ASC 808 ), because both parties are active participants in the activity and are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the activity s commercial failure or success. Because ASC 808 does not provide guidance on how to account for the activities under a collaborative arrangement, we applied the guidance in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 to account for the activities related to the Genentech Agreement.

 million upfront, non-refundable payment, as all potential regulatory and development milestone payments were probable of significant revenue reversal given their achievement was highly dependent on factors outside our control. As a result, these payments were fully constrained and were not included in the initial transaction price. In May 2023, one of the regulatory milestones was achieved, resulting in a million addition to the transaction price, million of which was recognized as revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2023, with the remainder included in deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue over the remaining research and development period. We continue to exclude the commercial milestones and potential royalties from the transaction price, as those items relate predominantly to the license rights granted to Genentech and will be assessed when and if such events occur. As there are potential substantive developments necessary, which Genentech may be able to direct, we determined that we would apply a proportional performance model to recognize revenue for our performance obligation. We measure proportional performance using an input method based on costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs of research and development efforts to pursue both the Shared Products and Personalized Product pathways. When any of the potential regulatory and development milestones are no longer fully constrained and are included in the transaction price, such amounts will be recognized using the cumulative catch-up method based on proportional performance at such time. We currently expect to recognize revenue generated from the Genentech Agreement over a period of approximately from the effective date. This estimate of the research and development period considers pursuit options of development activities supporting both the Shared Products and Personalized Product, but may be reduced or increased based on the various activities as directed by the joint committees, decisions made by Genentech, regulatory feedback or other factors not currently known. In total, we recognized million and million in Immune Medicine collaboration revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million in Immune Medicine collaboration revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the Genentech Agreement. Costs related to the Genentech Agreement are included in research and development expenses.

 million and million of the current and non-current deferred revenue balances, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and million and million of the current and non-current deferred revenue balances, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. We expect our current deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue within months. We expect the majority of our non-current deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue over a period of approximately four years from September 30, 2024. This period of time represents an estimate of the research and development period to develop cellular therapies in oncology, which may be reduced or increased based on various research and development activities.

We periodically review our available-for-sale securities to assess for credit impairment. Some of the factors considered in assessing impairment include the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions related to the security, an industry or geographic area, changes to security ratings or sector credit ratings and other relevant market data. As of September 30, 2024, we did not intend, nor were we more likely than not to be required, to sell our available-for-sale investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Based on our assessment, we concluded all impairment as of September 30, 2024 to be due to factors other than credit loss, such as changes in interest rates. A credit allowance was not recognized and the impairment of our available-for-sale securities was recorded in other comprehensive loss.

We are also entitled to receive up to million in subsequent installments as follows: (i) .0 million upon our request occurring no later than and (ii) million upon our request in connection with certain permitted acquisitions occurring no later than , in each case subject to certain funding conditions. As consideration for such payments, the Purchasers have a right to receive certain revenue interests (the Revenue Interests from us based on a percentage of all GAAP revenue. Payments in respect of the Revenue Interests shall be made quarterly within days following the end of each fiscal quarter (each, a Revenue Interest Payment ). Accounting Treatment We accounted for the transaction as debt recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. To determine the amortization of the Purchase Agreement obligation, we are required to estimate the amount and timing of future Revenue Interest Payments based on our estimate of the timing and amount of future revenues and calculate an effective interest rate which will amortize the obligation to over the amortization period. The calculated effective interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was . In connection with the Purchase Agreement, we incurred debt issuance costs of million. Debt issuance costs have been recorded to debt and are being amortized over the estimated term of the debt using the effective interest method, adjusted on a prospective basis for changes in the underlying assumptions and inputs. The assumptions used in determining the expected repayment term of the obligation and amortization period of the issuance costs requires that we make estimates that could impact the short- and long-term classification of these costs, as well as the period over which these costs will be amortized. We periodically assess the amount and timing of expected Revenue Interest Payments based on internal forecasts. To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the revenue interest liability and the effective interest rate.

Expected dividend yield 

The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options granted using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the fair value of our common stock, as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables that are subjective and generally require judgment to determine. The valuation assumptions were determined as follows: Fair value of common stock The fair value of each share of common stock is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, or other relevant determination date, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Expected term The expected term of stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors is determined using the simplified method, as illustrated in ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , as we do not have sufficient exercise history to determine a better estimate of expected term. Under this approach, the expected term is based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the stock option. Risk-free interest rate We utilize a risk-free interest rate in the option valuation model based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected terms of the stock options. Expected volatility Until 2024, as we did not have sufficient trading history for our common stock, expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded industry peers utilizing a period of time consistent with our estimate of expected term. Beginning in 2024, expected volatility was based on a weighted average of our historical volatility and the historical volatility of our publicly traded industry peers utilizing a period of time consistent with our estimate of expected term. Expected dividend yield We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of in the option valuation model. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, or other relevant determination date, as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of the market-based restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively, and was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which uses assumptions such as volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend estimated for the respective performance periods. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of the target payout level of the market-based restricted stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2024, shares, was . The aggregate share-based compensation expense of the market-based restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective grants' performance periods, which are also the requisite service periods. Attainment of each grant's respective market condition and the number of shares earned and vested does not impact the related share-based compensation expense recognized. Share-based compensation expense will be reversed only if the respective grantee does not provide continuous service through the respective performance period for reasons other than those expressly provided in the terms of the respective award.

operating segments: MRD and Immune Medicine. We incurred aggregate restructuring costs of million, primarily related to one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefit arrangements, which were paid as of June 30, 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we implemented additional restructuring initiatives which impacted certain planned software enhancements and resulted in the consolidation of certain research and development workflows. The impacted software enhancements were primarily associated with our laboratory information management systems. As part of these restructurings, we had long-lived assets that were no longer being utilized and we vacated certain leased space in South San Francisco, California. As such, we assessed the related assets for impairment by first comparing their carrying amounts to the future net undiscounted cash flows projected to be generated over their remaining lease terms or depreciable lives, as applicable. The carrying amounts were all found to be unrecoverable, thus we assessed the fair values of the assets. The extent to which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their fair values represents the impairment costs to be recognized. As a result of our assessments, we recognized million of impairment charges. Of the million charges recognized, million and million relates to the right-of-use asset and related long-lived assets (namely laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements), respectively, associated with certain of our leased space in South San Francisco, California. The remaining million recognized relates to the impairment of long-lived assets associated with our halted software enhancements. We also incurred an additional million in restructuring costs primarily related to one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefit arrangements, all of which has been paid as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, we incurred aggregate restructuring costs of million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily related to one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefit arrangements. These restructuring costs have not been paid as of September 30, 2024. In total, we recognized restructuring costs of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect the activities related to these restructurings to be complete as of December 31, 2024.

 inter-segment revenues. See Note 3, Revenue for more information about each segment's revenue. Our CODM evaluates performance of the MRD segment based on both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and evaluates performance of the Immune Medicine segment based on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for each of our segments includes costs that are directly aligned to each segment, as well as certain allocated shared expenses. These shared expenses primarily relate to our general and administrative functions, our non-laboratory facility space in our corporate headquarters and our production laboratory. We use the relative direct headcount assigned to each of the respective segments and our production laboratory sample volume to allocate these expenses. We do not allocate certain expenses, such as our corporate insurance costs, external legal and audit costs and expenses related to our investor relations, chief executive officer and other related support functions. Additionally, we do not allocate costs related to our idle facility in Seattle, Washington, interest expense related to our Purchase Agreement nor interest and other income, net. Given these unallocated costs and income are not included in the measurements reviewed by the CODM to assess each segment's performance, they are included in "Unallocated Corporate" below. Our allocation methodology will be periodically evaluated and may change. Our CODM is not regularly provided nor reviews assets when assessing each segment's performance and to allocate resources.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report, as well as the other financial information we file with the SEC from time to time. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to our future plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and financial performance and the assumptions that underlie these statements. 
 As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of this report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 We are advancing the field of immune medicine by harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our immune medicine platform applies our proprietary technologies to read the diverse genetic code of a patient s immune system and understand precisely how the immune system detects and treats disease in that patient. We capture these insights in our dynamic clinical immunomics database and related antigen annotations, which are underpinned by computational biology and machine learning, and use them to develop and commercialize clinical products and services that can be tailored to the needs of individual patients. Our existing and future commercial products and services are aligned to two business areas which we refer to as MRD and Immune Medicine. 
 Our current product and service offerings in MRD related to the MRD market are our clonoSEQ clinical diagnostic test, offered to clinicians, and our clonoSEQ or MRD assay, offered to biopharmaceutical partners to advance drug development efforts MRD Pharma ). Our first clinical diagnostic product, clonoSEQ, is the first test authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for the detection and monitoring of MRD in patients with multiple myeloma, B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and is also available as a CLIA-validated laboratory developed test for patients with other lymphoid cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. With the use of clonoSEQ, we are transforming how lymphoid cancers are treated by working with providers, pharmaceutical partners and payors. 
 Immune Medicine leverages our proprietary ability to sequence, map, pair and characterize T cell receptors TCRs and B cell receptors BCRs at scale to drive opportunities in cancer, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Our core research product, Adaptive Immunosequencing, serves as our underlying research and development engine and generates revenue from biopharmaceutical and academic customers. Leveraging our collaboration with Microsoft Corporation, we are creating the TCR-Antigen Map. We are using the TCR-Antigen Map to identify and validate disease signatures to improve the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. In Drug Discovery, we use our proprietary capabilities to discover new drug targets and leverage our validated TCR and BCR discovery approaches to discover and develop TCR or antibody therapeutic assets. Drug Discovery includes our worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech (the Genentech Agreement ). 
 We recognized revenue of 46.4 million and 37.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 131.5 million and 124.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation was 32.1 million and 50.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 125.8 million and 155.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock and, to a lesser extent, revenue and proceeds from the revenue interest purchase agreement we entered into in September 2022 with OrbiMed Royalty Credit Opportunities IV, LP, an affiliate of OrbiMed Advisors LLC, as collateral agent and administrative agent for the purchasers party thereto (the Purchase Agreement ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 267.2 million and 346.4 million, respectively. 
 Restructurings 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we implemented various restructuring plans which better aligned our organization to our two operating segments, impacted certain planned software enhancements and resulted in the consolidation of certain research and development workflows, among other things. The software enhancements were primarily associated with our laboratory information management systems. As part of these restructurings, we reduced our workforce, had long-lived assets that were no longer being utilized and vacated certain leased space in South San Francisco, California. As such, we recognized restructuring costs of 0.2 million and 9.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Of the 9.1 million restructuring costs recognized, 7.2 million related to impairment charges. The activities related to these restructurings were primarily completed as of September 30, 2024 and are expected to be fully complete as of December 31, 2024.

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation 

 Segment Information 
 In 2024, in connection with an organizational realignment, we began operating our business as two reporting segments: MRD and Immune Medicine. These segments are organized by market opportunity in commercial diagnostics and drug discovery, respectively. See Note 14, Segment Information of the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information regarding our segments and the assumptions used to allocate shared expenses. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 2023 Quarterly Segment Information included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 filed with the SEC on May 7, 2024 for quarterly 2023 segment information. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We derive revenue by providing diagnostic and research services in our MRD and Immune Medicine business areas. Our MRD revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing our clonoSEQ report to clinical customers; (2) providing MRD sample testing services to biopharmaceutical customers and certain academic institutions, including investigator-led clinical trials; and (3) providing our clonoSEQ report or results to certain international laboratory sites through technology transfers. We disclose our clonoSEQ test volume, which includes the number of clonoSEQ reports and results we have provided to ordering physicians in the United States U.S. and international technology transfer sites. These volumes do not include sample results from our biopharmaceutical customers or academic institutions utilizing our MRD services. Our Immune Medicine revenue consists of revenue generated from (1) providing sample testing services for our commercial research product, Adaptive Immunosequencing, to biopharmaceutical customers and academic institutions; and (2) our collaboration agreements with Genentech and other biopharmaceutical customers in areas of drug and target discovery. 
 For our clinical customers, we primarily derive revenue from providing our clonoSEQ report to ordering physicians. We bill commercial, government and medical institution payors based on reports delivered to ordering physicians. Amounts paid for clonoSEQ by commercial, government and medical institution payors vary based on respective reimbursement rates and patient responsibilities, which may differ from our targeted list price. We recognize clinical revenue by evaluating customer payment history, contracted reimbursement rates, if applicable, and other adjustments to estimate the amount of revenue that is collectible. 
 For our clonoSEQ coverage under Medicare, we bill an episode of treatment when we deliver the first eligible test report. This billing contemplates all necessary tests required during a patient s treatment cycle, which is currently estimated at approximately four tests per patient, including the initial sequence identification test. Revenue recognition commences at the time the initial billable test report is delivered and is based upon cumulative tests delivered to date. Any unrecognized revenue from the initial billable test is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized either as we deliver our estimate of the remaining tests in a patient s treatment cycle or when the likelihood becomes remote that a patient will receive additional testing. 
 For our research customers, which include biopharmaceutical customers and academic institutions for both our MRD and Adaptive Immunosequencing services, delivery of the respective test results may include some level of professional support and analysis. Terms with biopharmaceutical customers generally include non-refundable payments made in advance of services upfront payments ), which we record as deferred revenue. For all research customers, we recognize revenue as we deliver sequencing results. From time to time, we offer discounts in order to gain rights and access to certain datasets. Revenue is recognized net of these discounts and costs associated with these services are reflected in cost of revenue. In periods where our sample estimates are reduced or a customer project is cancelled and, in either case, we have remaining related deferred revenue, we recognize revenue using a cumulative catch-up approach based on the proportion of samples delivered to date relative to the total samples expected to be delivered. Certain of our MRD revenue arrangements with biopharmaceutical customers include cash consideration from the achievement of regulatory milestones of the respective biopharmaceutical customers therapeutics. Such revenue is constrained from recognition until it becomes probable that such milestone will be achieved. 
 Under certain agreements with our biopharmaceutical customers who seek access to our platform to support their therapeutic development activities, revenues are generated from research and development support services that we provide. These agreements may include substantial non-refundable upfront payments, which we recognize over time as we perform the respective services. Revenue recognized from these activities relate primarily to the Genentech Agreement. 
 We expect our MRD revenue to increase in the long term as we continue to increase our MRD clinical testing volume through increased penetration in our existing covered patient populations, expand into new patient populations and optimize payor coverage. Our MRD revenue may fluctuate period to period due to the uncertain timing of receipt of our biopharmaceutical customer samples, which may cause uncertainty in the delivery of our products and services, the recognition of milestones related to regulatory approvals of our biopharmaceutical customers therapeutics and changes in estimates of our clinical revenue reimbursement rates. 
 27 

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation 

 We expect our Immune Medicine revenue to increase in the long term as we or our collaborators advance therapies to commercialization. Our Immune Medicine revenue may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of expenses incurred, changes in estimates of total anticipated costs related to the Genentech Agreement and other events not within our control, including the recognition of milestones under the Genentech Agreement and the timing of receipt of customer samples from our biopharmaceutical customers. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue includes the cost of materials, personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), shipping and handling expenses, equipment costs, allocated facility costs associated with processing samples and professional support costs related to our service revenue activities. Allocated facility costs include depreciation of laboratory equipment, as well as allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs. Costs associated with processing samples are recorded as expense, regardless of the timing of revenue recognition. As such, cost of revenue and related volume does not always trend in the same direction as revenue recognition and related volume. Additionally, costs to support the Genentech Agreement are a component of our research and development expenses. 
 We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in the long term as we grow our sample testing volume, but the cost per sample to decrease over the long term due to the efficiencies we may gain as assay volume increases from improved utilization of our laboratory capacity, automation and other value engineering initiatives. If our sample volume throughput is reduced, cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue may be adversely impacted due to fixed overhead costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist of laboratory materials costs, personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation), equipment costs, allocated facility and information technology costs and contract service expenses. Research and development activities support further development and refinement of existing assays and products, discovery of new technologies and investments in our immune medicine platform. We also include in research and development expenses the costs associated with software development of applications to support future commercial opportunities, as well as development activities to support laboratory scaling and workflow. We are currently conducting research and development activities for several products and services and we typically use our laboratory materials, personnel, facilities, information technology and other development resources across multiple development programs. Additionally, certain of these research and development activities benefit more than one of our product opportunities. We have not historically tracked research and development expenses by specific product candidates. 
 The costs to support the Genentech Agreement are a component of our research and development expenses. Additionally, a component of our research and development expenses are costs supporting clinical and analytical validations to obtain regulatory approval for future clinical products and services. Some of these activities have generated and may in the future generate revenue. 
 We expect research and development expenses to decrease in the short term and to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of our development and commercialization efforts. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses include personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation) for commercial sales, product and account management, marketing, reimbursement, medical education and business development personnel that support commercialization of our platform products. In addition, these expenses include external costs such as advertising expenses, customer education and promotional expenses, market analysis expenses, conference fees, travel expenses and allocated facility and information technology costs. 
 We expect sales and marketing expenses to experience moderate increases in the short term. In the long term, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we increase marketing activities to drive awareness and adoption of our products and services. However, we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term, subject to fluctuations from period to period due to the timing and magnitude of these expenses. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include personnel-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation) for our personnel in executive, legal, finance and accounting, human resources and other administrative functions, including third-party clinical billing services. In addition, these expenses include insurance costs, external legal costs, accounting and tax service expenses, consulting fees and allocated facility and information technology costs. 
 28 

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation 

 We expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively consistent in the short term and to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense includes costs associated with our revenue interest liability related to the Purchase Agreement and noncash interest costs associated with the amortization of the related deferred issuance costs. We impute interest expense using the effective interest rate method. We calculate an effective interest rate which will amortize our related obligation to zero over the anticipated repayment period. A significant increase or decrease in or changes in timing of forecasted revenue will prospectively impact our interest expense.

The 12.8 million increase in MRD revenue was primarily due to a 5.6 million increase in revenue generated from providing clonoSEQ to clinical customers, a 5.0 million increase in revenue recognized upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones by one of our biopharmaceutical customers, a 2.0 million increase in revenue generated from providing MRD sample testing services to biopharmaceutical customers and a 0.4 million increase in revenue generated from providing MRD sample testing services to investigator-led clinical trials. Our clonoSEQ test volume increased by 30 to 19,600 tests delivered in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 15,072 tests delivered in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The 4.3 million decrease in Immune Medicine revenue was primarily due to a 4.5 million decrease in revenue generated from the Genentech Agreement, which resulted from decreased collaboration expenses, partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in revenue generated from our biopharmaceutical and academic customers.

The 33.4 million increase in MRD revenue was primarily due to a 18.7 million increase in revenue generated from providing clonoSEQ to clinical customers, a 12.5 million increase in revenue recognized upon the achievement of regulatory milestones by our biopharmaceutical customers and a 3.5 million increase in revenue generated from providing MRD sample testing services to biopharmaceutical customers. These increases were partially offset by a 1.1 million decrease in revenue generated from providing MRD sample testing services to investigator-led clinical trials. Our clonoSEQ test volume increased by 35 to 55,160 tests delivered in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 40,816 tests delivered in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The 26.4 million decrease in Immune Medicine revenue was primarily due to a 24.7 million decrease in revenue generated from the Genentech Agreement, which resulted from decreased collaboration expenses and decreased revenue recognized from the 10.0 million regulatory milestone achieved in May 2023, and a 1.7 million decrease in revenue generated from our biopharmaceutical and academic customers.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Adjusted EBITDA below for an explanation of how it is calculated and used by management. 
 The 36.4 million reduction in MRD Adjusted EBITDA deficit was primarily attributable to a 33.4 million increase in MRD revenue and a reduction in operating expenses, excluding those identified as reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA. The primary driver of the operating expense reduction relates to general and administrative activities. 
 The 8.0 million increase in Immune Medicine Adjusted EBITDA deficit was primarily attributable to a 26.4 million reduction in Immune Medicine revenue, which was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses, excluding those identified as reconciling items between net loss and adjusted EBITDA. The primary driver of the operating expense reduction relates to research and development activities. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation adjusted for interest and other income, net, interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment costs for long-lived assets, restructuring expense and share-based compensation expense. We define our segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same way to the extent the net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation and adjustments are allocable to each segment. See Note 14, Segment Information of the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information regarding segment Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate the financial performance of our business and segments and to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies. We present these figures because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry and it facilitates comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes items that are not indicative of our core operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We may in the future incur expenses similar to the adjustments we make. In particular, we expect to incur meaningful share-based compensation expense in the future. Other limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA, including segment Adjusted EBITDA, does not reflect: 
 all expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

changes in our working capital needs; 

34 

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation 

 interest expense, which is an ongoing element of our costs to operate; 

income tax (expense) benefit, which may be a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate; 

the costs of replacing the assets being depreciated and amortized, which will often have to be replaced in the future; 

the noncash component of employee compensation expense; 

long-lived assets impairment costs; and 

the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations, such as our restructuring activities and reductions in workforce. 

In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):

See Note 8, Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement of the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details on the Purchase Agreement. 
 (2) Represents expenses recognized in conjunction with restructuring activities. See Note 12, Restructurings of the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details on our restructuring expenses. 
 (3) Represents share-based compensation expense related to stock option, restricted stock unit and market-based restricted stock unit awards. See Note 11, Equity Incentive Plans of the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for details on our share-based compensation expense. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred losses since inception and have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception through September 30, 2024, with the exception of certain 2019 periods for which we had positive cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1.3 billion. 
 We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock, and, to a lesser extent, revenue and proceeds from the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement entered into in September 2022, we received net cash proceeds of 124.4 million, after deducting issuance costs. We are also entitled to receive up to 125.0 million in subsequent installments as follows: (i) 75.0 million upon our request occurring no later than September 12, 2025 and (ii) 50.0 million upon our request in connection with certain permitted acquisitions occurring no later than September 12, 2025, in each case subject to certain funding conditions. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 267.2 million. 
 We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. We may consider raising additional capital to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons. 
 35 

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation 

 If our available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and anticipated cash flows are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may request an additional installment under the Purchase Agreement, seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, enter into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and, in the case of preferred equity securities or convertible debt, those securities could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. This additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. 
 We plan to utilize the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand primarily to fund our commercial and marketing activities associated with clonoSEQ, our continued investments in streamlining our laboratory operations and our continued research and development initiatives related to drug discovery. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to capital preservation and liquidity. Currently, our funds are held in money market funds and marketable securities consisting of U.S. government treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper. 
 While we may experience variability in revenue in the near term, over the long-term we expect revenue from our current and future products and services to grow. Accordingly, we expect our accounts receivable and inventory balances to increase. Our levels of accounts receivable may fluctuate relative to our revenue for a number of reasons, including the timing of milestone triggers and related payment of those milestones, as well as reductions in revenue derived from the upfront payment received under the Genentech Agreement and an increase in revenue generated from clinical customers, which may result in more billings in arrears as opposed to upfront payments. Any increase in accounts receivable and inventory may not be completely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which could result in greater working capital requirements. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations and commitments as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

Operating Activities 
 Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 82.7 million, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of 125.9 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 20.5 million, partially offset by noncash share-based compensation of 40.8 million, noncash depreciation and amortization of 8.1 million, noncash impairment of long-lived assets of 7.2 million related to our restructuring activities, noncash lease expense of 4.0 million, noncash interest expense related to the Purchase Agreement of 2.0 million and inventory reserve expense of 1.4 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an 8.8 million reduction in deferred revenue largely driven by revenue recognized for Genentech, a 6.4 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, a 3.6 million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a 2.8 million increase in accounts receivable, net and a 0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. These changes were partially offset by a 2.0 million decrease in inventory.

 Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 129.4 million, which was primarily attributable to a net loss of 155.8 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of 42.7 million, partially offset by noncash share-based compensation of 47.4 million, noncash depreciation and amortization of 10.6 million, noncash lease expense of 5.5 million, noncash interest expense related to the Purchase Agreement of 4.6 million and inventory reserve expense of 0.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a 23.2 million reduction in deferred revenue related primarily to revenue recognized from the Genentech Agreement, a 10.7 million reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities largely driven by the payout of our corporate bonus during the three months ended March 31, 2023, a 6.8 million increase in inventory, a 6.7 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities and a 4.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets largely driven by an increase in prepaid software charges. These changes were partially offset by an 8.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, net primarily related to collections from our biopharmaceutical customers. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 55.7 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 258.7 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of 199.5 million and purchases of property and equipment of 3.6 million. 
 Cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 126.4 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 443.4 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of 307.6 million and purchases of property and equipment of 9.4 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.1 million, which was attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.2 million, which was attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Net Operating Loss Carryforwards 
 Utilization of our net operating loss NOL carryforwards and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Section 382 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL carryforwards and credits before utilization. If there should be an ownership change, our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and credits could be limited. We have completed a Section 382 analysis for changes in ownership through December 31, 2023 and continue to monitor for changes that could trigger a limitation. Based on this analysis, we do not expect to have any permanent limitations on the utilization of our federal NOLs. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, federal NOLs incurred in 2018 and future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is subject to an annual limitation. NOLs generated prior to 2018 are eligible to be carried forward up to 20 years. Based on the available objective evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would not be realizable as of December 31, 2023. Accordingly, management applied a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have prepared the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expense recorded during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are used in several areas, including, but not limited to, estimates of progress to date for certain performance obligations and the transaction price for certain contracts with customers, imputing interest for the Purchase Agreement, the provision for income taxes, including related reserves, the analysis of goodwill impairment and the recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, among others. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require judgments, involve the analysis of historical results and prediction of future trends, can require extended periods of time to resolve and are subject to change from period to period. Actual results may differ materially from management s estimates.

Adaptive Biotechnologies Corporation 

 While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, as well as in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies of the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements: 
 revenue recognition; 

imputing interest for the Purchase Agreement; 

goodwill; and 

recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets. 

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies of the accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our market risks as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. We do not enter into investments for trading purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 
 Item 4. Contro ls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. There was not any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Pro ceedings 
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Risk Facto rs 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the risks and uncertainties that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part I, Item 1A under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.
