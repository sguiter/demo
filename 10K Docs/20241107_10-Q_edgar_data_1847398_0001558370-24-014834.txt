 mortgage-backed securities that had unrealized losses due to interest rate volatility. Credit Quality Indicators The held to maturity securities portfolio consists of agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds. All agency mortgage-backed securities are issued by U.S. government entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The municipal bonds in the portfolio carry no lower than A ratings from the rating agencies at September 30, 2024 and have no realized losses since they were issued. The Company regularly monitors the municipal bonds sector of the market and reviews collectability including such factors as the financial condition of the issuers as well as credit ratings in effect as of the reporting period. Multi-family Mixed-use Total residential real estate Non-residential real estate Construction Commercial and industrial Consumer Total Loans Deferred loan (fees) costs, net ) Allowance for credit losses ) ) Loans serviced for the benefit of others totaled approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The value of mortgage servicing rights was not material at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statement of financial condition date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely. The allowance for credit losses on loans is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is based on the relevant available information from internal and external sources related to past events and current conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.

Expenses of and for the three months, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were recorded for this plan and are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income under Salaries and Employee Benefits. Stock-Based Deferral Plan In June 2021, the Company established a stock-based deferral plan for eligible key executives and members of the Board of Directors of the Company to elect to defer compensation received from the Company for their services and make deemed investments of that deferred compensation in shares of the Company s common stock. At September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any obligations under the plan. 401(k) Plan The Company maintains a 401(k) plan for all eligible employees. Participants are permitted to contribute from to or of their annual compensation up to the maximum permitted under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company provided matching contribution during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP In conjunction with the Mid-Tier Holding Company s public stock offering in 2006, the Bank established an ESOP for all eligible employees (substantially all full-time employees). The ESOP borrowed from the Mid-Tier Holding Company and used those funds to acquire shares of Mid-Tier Holding Company common stock at per share. The loan from the Mid-Tier Holding Company, which has been assumed by the Company, carries an interest rate of and is repayable in annual installments through 2025. In conjunction with the Company s second-step conversion offering, on July 12, 2021, the ESOP borrowed from the Company and used those funds to acquire shares of Company common stock at per share. The loan from the Company carries an interest rate equal to and is repayable in annual installments through 2035. Each year, the Bank makes discretionary contributions to the ESOP equal to the principal and interest payment required on the loan from the Company. The ESOP may further pay down the principal balance of the loans by using dividends paid, if any, on the shares of Company common stock it owns. The balance remaining on the first ESOP loan was at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The balance remaining on the second ESOP loan was at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Shares purchased for the ESOP with the loan proceeds serve as collateral for the loan and are held in a suspense account for future allocation among ESOP participants. As the loan principal is repaid, shares will be released from the suspense account and become eligible for allocation. The allocation among plan participants will be as described in the ESOP governing document. ESOP shares initially pledged as collateral were recorded as unearned ESOP shares in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Thereafter, on a monthly basis over the terms of the ESOP loans, approximately shares for the ESOP loan made in 2006 and approximately shares for the ESOP loan made in 2021 are committed to be released, respectively. Compensation expense is recorded equal to the shares committed to be released multiplied by the average closing price of the Company s stock during that month. ESOP

The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows: For real estate owned, fair value is generally determined through independent appraisals or fair value estimations of the underlying properties which generally include various Level 3 inputs which are not identifiable. The appraisals or fair value estimation may be adjusted by management for qualitative reasons and estimated liquidation expenses. Management s assumptions may include consideration of location and occupancy of the property and current economic conditions. Subsequently, as these properties are actively marketed, the estimated fair values may be periodically adjusted through incremental subsequent write-downs to reflect decreases in estimated values resulting from sales price observations and the impact of changing economic and market conditions.

 A description of the Company s revenue streams accounted for under ASC 606 is as follows: Service Charges on Deposit Accounts The Company earns fees from deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance, and overdraft services. Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering, and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed at the point in the time the Company fulfills the customer s request. Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned over the course of a month, representing the period over which the Company satisfies the performance obligation. Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs. Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer s account balance. Electronic Banking Fee Income The Company earns interchange fees from debit and credit card holder transactions conducted through various payment networks. Interchange fees from cardholder transactions are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided by an outsourced technology solution. Investment Advisory Fees The Company previously earned fees from investment advisory and financial planning services under the name of Harbor West Wealth Management Group, a former division of the Bank, through a networking arrangement with a registered broker-dealer and investment advisor. Under this prior arrangement, the registered broker-dealer deducted investment advisory fees and financial planning services fees from the client s assets under management and remitted the fees, net of administrative fees, to the Bank on a monthly basis. The Company recognized the fees into non-interest income upon the Bank s receipt of the monthly remittances.

Critical Accounting Policies We consider accounting policies involving significant judgements and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider these accounting policies to be our crucial accounting policies. The judgements and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these judgements and estimates under different conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Balance Sheet Analysis General Total assets increased 203.8 million, or 11.6 , to 2.0 billion at September 30, 2024, from 1.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in assets was primarily due to an increase in net loans of 173.6 million and an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 29.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased 29.1 million, or 42.4 , to 97.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 68.7 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was a result of an increase in deposits of 228.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in borrowings of 57.0 million, an increase of 173.6 million in net loans, and stock repurchases of 2.4 million. Equity securities increased 2.4 million, or 13.5 , to 20.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 18.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in equity securities was attributable to the purchase of 2.0 million in equity securities during the third quarter of 2024 and market appreciation of 445,000 due to market interest rate volatility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Securities held-to-maturity decreased 799,000, or 5.0 , to 15.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 15.9 million at December 31, 2023 due to 810,000 in maturities and pay-downs of various investment securities, partially offset by a decrease of 10,000 in the allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity securities. Loans, net of the allowance for credit losses, increased 173.6 million, or 11.0 , to 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in loans, net of the allowance for credit losses, was primarily due to loan originations of 569.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of 499.7 million in construction loans with respect to which approximately 34.1 of the funds were disbursed at loan closings, with the remaining funds to be disbursed over the terms of the construction loans. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated 44.7 million in commercial and industrial loans, 14.0 million in non-residential loans, 4.2 million in multi-family loans, and 600,000 in mixed-use loans. Loan originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a net increase of 148.8 million in construction loans, 14.4 million in commercial and industrial loans, 9.2 million in non-residential loans, 3.6 million in multi-family loans, and 788,000 in consumer loans. The increase in our loan portfolio was partially offset by decreases of 1.7 million in residential loans and 1.2 million in mixed-use loans, coupled with normal pay-downs and principal reductions. The allowance for credit losses related to loans decreased to 4.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from 5.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses related to loans was due to a credit to the provision for credit losses totaling 145,000 and charge-offs of 115,000. Premises and equipment decreased 507,000, or 2.0 , to 24.9 million at September 30, 2024 from 25.5 million at December 31, 2023 primarily due to the depreciation of fixed assets. Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank stock decreased 217,000, or 23.4 , to 712,000 at September 30, 2024 from 929,000 at December 31, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to the mandatory redemption of Federal Home Loan Bank stock totaling 315,000 in connection with the maturity of 7.0 million in advances in 2024, offset by purchases of Federal Home Loan Bank stock totaling 98,000 due to the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. Bank owned life insurance BOLI increased 486,000, or 1.9 , to 25.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 25.1 million at December 31, 2023 due to increases in the BOLI cash value. Accrued interest receivable increased 1.2 million, or 9.4 , to 13.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 12.3 million at December 31, 2023 due to an increase in the loan portfolio. Real estate owned decreased 478,000, or 32.8 , to 978,000 at September 30, 2024 from 1.5 million at December 31, 2023 due to a charge-off of 478,000 resulting from a decrease in the estimated fair value of the foreclosed property. Right of use assets operating decreased 422,000, or 9.2 , to 4.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to amortization. Other assets decreased 548,000, or 6.8 , to 7.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 8.0 million at December 31, 2023 due to decreases in tax assets of 671,000, prepaid expenses of 56,000, miscellaneous assets of 4,000, and securities receivables of 1,000, partially offset by increase in suspense accounts of 184,000. Total deposits increased 228.0 million, or 16.3 , to 1.6 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.4 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits was primarily due to the Bank offering competitive interest rates to attract deposits. This resulted in a shift in deposits whereby certificates of deposit increased 230.5 million, or 30.3 , and NOW/money market accounts increased 83.5 million, or 57.4 , partially offset by decreases in savings account balances of 53.4 million, or 27.7 , and non-interest bearing demand deposits of 32.6 million, or 10.9 . Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased 7.0 million, or 50.0 , to 7.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 14.0 million at December 31, 2023 due to the maturity of borrowings in 2024. Federal Reserve Bank borrowings of 50.0 million at December 31, 2023 were paid-off during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance increased 442,000, or 21.9 , to 2.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 2.0 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to accumulation of real estate tax payments by borrowers. Lease liability operating decreased 384,000, or 8.3 , to 4.2 million at September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to amortization. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased 2.4 million, or 17.8 , to 16.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 13.6 million at December 31, 2023 due primarily to increases in dividends payable of 3.2 million and deferred compensation of 395,000, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expense of 810,000. The allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet commitments decreased 130,000, or 12.5 , to 908,000 at September 30, 2024 from 1.0 million at December 31, 2023. Stockholders equity increased 30.3 million, or 10.8 to 309.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 279.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders equity was due to net income of 36.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amortization expense of 1.4 million relating to restricted stock and stock options granted under the Company s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, a reduction of 652,000 in unearned employee stock ownership plan shares coupled with an increase of 532,000 in earned employee stock ownership plan shares, an exercise of stock options totaling 14,000, and 10,000 in other comprehensive income, partially offset by stock repurchases totaling 2.5 million and dividends paid and declared of 6.7 million. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Financial Highlights Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.7 million compared to net income of 11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income of 843,000, or 7.1 , between periods was primarily due to an increase in net interest income, an increase in non-interest income and a reduction in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense and an increase in income tax expense. Net Interest Income Net interest income was 26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income of 1.2 million, or 4.6 , was primarily due to an increase in interest income that exceeded an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income is attributable to increases in the average balances of loans, interest-bearing deposits, and investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of FHLB stock. The increase in interest income is also attributable to the Federal Reserve s interest rate increases in 2023 that continued until September 2024. The increase in market interest rates in 2023 that continued until September 2024 also caused an increase in our interest expense. As a result, the increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in the cost of funds on our deposits and borrowed money. The increase in interest expense was also due to an increase in the average balances on our certificates of deposits, our interest-bearing demand deposits, and our borrowed money, offset by a decrease in the average balances on our savings and club deposits. Total interest and dividend income increased 6.0 million, or 17.2 , to 41.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 35.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income was due to an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of 282.6 million, or 18.0 , to 1.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets by 6 basis points from 8.95 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Interest expense increased 4.9 million, or 48.9 , to 14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities by 59 basis points from 3.86 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.45 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of 301.8 million, or 29.1 , to 1.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin decreased 72 basis points, or 11.3 , to 5.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.40 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to the increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the increase in the yield on interest-earning assets. Credit Loss Expense The Company recorded a provision for credit loss of 105,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a provision for credit loss of 156,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The credit loss expense of 105,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of a credit loss expense for off-balance sheet commitments of 105,000 primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average remaining maturity for the aggregate unfunded off-balance sheet commitments. The credit loss expense of 156,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of credit loss for loans of 438,000, partially offset by credit loss expense reduction for off-balance sheet commitments of 278,000 and credit loss expense reduction for held-to-maturity securities of 4,000. With respect to the allowance for credit losses for loans, we charged-off 82,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to charge-offs of 71,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. These charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were against various unpaid overdrafts in our demand deposit accounts. We recorded no recoveries from previously charged-off loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Based on a review at September 30, 2024 of the loans that were in the loan portfolio, our off-balance sheet credit exposures, and our HTM investment securities, management believes that the allowances for these three components are maintained at a level that represents our best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and HTM investment securities that were both probable and reasonably estimable. Management uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the three ACLs. Future additions or reductions to the three ACLs might be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. As a result, our three ACLs might not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our three ACLs. Such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the three ACLs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.3 million compared to non-interest income of 221,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.1 million, or 510.4 , in total non-interest income was primarily due to increases of 977,000 in unrealized gain on equity securities, 225,000 in other loan fees and service charges, 26,000 in miscellaneous other non-interest income, and 14,000 in BOLI income, partially offset by a decrease of 114,000 in investment advisory fees. The increase in unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities was due to an unrealized gain of 547,000 on equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 430,000 on equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The unrealized gain of 547,000 on equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to market interest rate volatility during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

 The increase of 225,000 in other loan fees and service charges was due to an increase of 210,000 in other loan fees and loan servicing fees and an increase of 15,000 in ATM/debit card/ACH fees. The decrease in investment advisory fees was due to the disposition in January 2024 of the Bank s assets relating to the Harbor West Wealth Management Group. As a result of the transaction, the Bank no longer generates investment advisory fees. Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense increased 1.0 million, or 11.7 , to 10.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from increases of 477,000 in real estate owned expense, 435,000 in salaries and employee benefits, 119,000 in occupancy expense, and 112,000 in outside data processing expense, partially offset by decreases of 53,000 in equipment expense, 39,000 in other operating expense, and 5,000 in advertising expense. Real estate owned expense increased 477,000, or 4,336.4 , to 488,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 11,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a write down of 478,000 on the fair market value of a foreclosed property because the office occupancy rate in the Pittsburgh business district office market continues to deteriorate due to workers continuing to work remotely post pandemic, the high operating expenses due to inflation, and the high interest rates. Salaries and employee benefits increased 435,000, or 9.3 , to 5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits expense in order to retain key personnel. Occupancy expense increased 119,000, or 19.3 , to 735,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 616,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of the increased cost of operating office space. Outside data processing expense increased 112,000, or 19.7 , to 681,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 569,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to additional data processing services to support the growth of the Company. Equipment expense decreased 53,000, or 22.1 , to 187,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 240,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a reduced need to purchase additional equipment. Other non-interest expense decreased 39,000, or 1.5 , to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due mainly to decreases of 154,000 in legal fees, 30,000 in miscellaneous other non-interest expense, 29,000 in audit and accounting fees, 22,000 in telephone expense, and 4,000 in office supplies. These decreases were offset by increases of 76,000 in regulatory fees, 74,000 in service contracts expense, 16,000 in directors compensation, 16,000 in directors, officers and employees expense, 9,000 in insurance expense, 9,000 in dues and subscriptions expense, and 1,000 in expenses related to the hiring of personnel. Legal fees decreased 154,000, or 64.9 , to 84,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 238,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a reduction in transactions requiring legal services. Miscellaneous other non-interest expense decreased 30,000, or 16.4 , to 155,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 185,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreases of 23,000 in miscellaneous charge-offs, 13,000 in miscellaneous expenses, and 7,000 in public company expenses, partially offset by increases of 10,000 in check and correspondence bank charges and 3,000 in postage expenses.

Telephone expense decreased by 22,000, or 13.4 , to 145,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 167,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a reduction in telephone usages. Office supplies decreased 4,000, or 8.4 , to 40,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 44,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to reduced need for office supplies.

Service contracts expense increased 74,000, or 20.6 , to 438,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 364,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the increased cost to support the growth of the Company. Directors compensation increased 16,000, or 25.8 , to 233,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 217,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in directors fees. Directors, officers, and employees expenses increased 16,000, or 25.8 , to 78,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 62,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to tuition payments for employees. Insurance expense increased 9,000, or 8.9 , to 106,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 97,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a general increase in insurance premiums. Dues and subscriptions expense increased 9,000, or 4.9 , to 182,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 173,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a general increase in these expenses.

Income Taxes. We recorded income tax expense of 4.9 million and 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had approximately 203,000 in tax exempt income, compared to approximately 187,000 in tax exempt income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our effective income tax rates were 27.8 and 27.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Financial Highlights Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 36.9 million compared to net income of 34.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income of 2.7 million, or 7.9 , between periods was primarily due to an increase in net interest income and a credit loss expense reduction, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income, an increase in non-interest expense, and an increase in income tax expense. Net Interest Income Net interest income was 77.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 72.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest income of 5.5 million, or 7.7 , was primarily due to an increase in interest income that exceeded an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income is attributable to increases in loans and interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by decreases in investment securities and FHLB stock. The increase in interest income is also attributable to the Federal Reserve s interest rate increases during 2023 that continued until September 2024. The increase in market interest rates in 2023 that continued until September 2024 also caused an increase in our interest expense. As a result, the increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in the cost of funds on our deposits and borrowed money. The increase in interest expense was also due to increases in the balances on our certificates of deposits, our interest-bearing demand deposits, and our borrowed money, offset by a decrease in the balances of our savings and club deposits. Total interest and dividend income increased 24.2 million, or 25.4 , to 119.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 95.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income was due to an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of 332.7 million, or 22.7 , to 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the yield on interest earning assets by 19 basis points from 8.66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Interest expense increased 18.7 million, or 79.9 , to 42.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities by 101 basis points from 3.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of 355.6 million, or 38.2 , to 1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 931.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin decreased 80 basis points, or 12.2 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 5.74 compared to 6.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Credit Loss Expense The Company recorded a credit loss expense reduction totaling 286,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a credit loss expense totaling 767,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The credit loss expense reduction of 286,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised of a credit loss expense reduction for loans of 145,000, a credit loss expense reduction for off-balance sheet commitments of 130,000, and a credit loss expense reduction for held-to-maturity investment securities of 11,000. The credit loss expense reduction for loans of 145,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to favorable trends in the economy. The credit loss expense reduction for off-balance sheet commitments of 130,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributed to a reduction of 69.1 million in the level of off-balance sheet commitments, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average remaining maturity for the aggregate unfunded off-balance sheet commitments during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The credit loss expense of 767,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of credit loss expense for loans of 1.2 million, partially offset by a credit loss expense reduction for off-balance sheet commitments of 395,000 and credit loss expense reduction for held-to-maturity investment securities of 1,000. We charged-off 115,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to charge-offs of 286,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The charge-offs of 115,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were against various unpaid overdrafts in our demand deposit accounts. The charge-offs of 286,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were comprised of a charge-off of 159,000 related to three performing construction loans on the same project whereby we sold the loans to a third-party subsequent to June 30, 2023 at a loss of 159,000. The remaining charge-offs of 127,000 for the 2023 period were against various unpaid overdrafts in our demand deposit accounts. We recorded no recoveries from previously charged-off loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million compared to non-interest income of 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 277,000, or 11.8 , in total non-interest income was primarily due to increases of 772,000 in unrealized gains on equity securities, 196,000 in other loan fees and service charges, and 23,000 in miscellaneous other non-interest income, offset by decreases of 371,000 in BOLI income and 343,000 in investment advisory fees. The increase in unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities was due to an unrealized gain of 445,000 on equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of 327,000 on equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The unrealized gain of 445,000 on equity securities during the 2024 period was due to market interest rate volatility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of 196,000 in other loan fees and service charges was due to increases of 164,000 in other loan fees and loan servicing fees, 27,000 in ATM/debit card/ACH fees, and 5,000 in savings account fees. The decrease in BOLI income was primarily due to two death claims totaling 1.8 million on BOLI policies that resulted in additional BOLI income of 404,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in

The increase resulted primarily from increases of 1.7 million in salaries and employee benefits, 800,000 in other operating expense, 475,000 in real estate owned expense, 286,000 in outside data processing expense, and 226,000 in occupancy expense, partially offset by decreases of 183,000 in equipment expense and 110,000 in advertising expense. Salaries and employee benefits increased 1.6 million, or 11.8 , to 15.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits expense in order to retain key personnel. Other non-interest expense increased 800,000, or 11.3 , to 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due mainly to increases of 584,000 in regulatory fees, 244,000 in service contracts expenses, 57,000 in dues and subscription expenses, 53,000 in directors compensation, 48,000 in directors, officers, and employees expenses, 30,000 in audit and accounting fees, 28,000 in insurance expenses, 16,000 in office supplies, and 3,000 in expenses related to the hiring of personnel.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had two non-performing, non-accrual construction loans totaling 4.4 million secured by the same project located in the Bronx, New York. We successfully foreclosed on these two loans on October 21, 2024 and the balances were transferred to foreclosed real estate. The other non-performing assets consisted of one foreclosed property at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not collect any interest income from loans that were in non-accrual status. From time to time, as part of our loss mitigation strategy, we may modify loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. There were no new loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

In addition, the Company s allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet commitments totaled 907,000 and an allowance for credit losses related to held-to-maturity debt securities totaled 126,000 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.0 million and 136,000, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses related to loans decreased 260,000 to 4.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 5.1 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was due primarily to a credit loss expense reduction for loans of 145,000 and charge-offs of 115,000 against various unpaid overdrafts in our demand deposit accounts. The allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet commitments decreased 131,000 to 907,000 at September 30, 2024 from 1.1 million at December 31, 2023 due to a credit loss expense reduction of 131,000 at September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses related to held-to-maturity of debt securities decreased 10,000 due to a credit loss expense reduction of 10,000 at September 30, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources We maintain liquid assets at levels we believe are adequate to meet our liquidity needs. We established a liquidity ratio policy that identify three liquidity ratios consisting of (1) Cash/Deposits Short Term Borrowings Cash Liquidity ), (2) Cash Investments/Deposits Short Term Borrowings On Balance Sheet Liquidity ), and (3) Cash Investments Borrowing Capacity/Deposits Short Term Borrowings On Balance Sheet Liquidity Borrowing Capacity to assist in the management of our liquidity. We also establish targets of 2.0 for the Cash Liquidity ratio, 8.0 for the On Balance Sheet Liquidity ratio, and 20.0 for the On Balance Sheet Liquidity Borrowing Capacity ratio. 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 Our Cash Liquidity ratio, On Balance Sheet Liquidity ratio, and On Balance Sheet Liquidity Borrowing Capacity ratio averaged 6.9 , 8.9 , and 67.2 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.7 , 9.6 , and 32.7 , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, pay real estate taxes on real estate loans, repay our borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives. Our liquidity ratios cannot be calculated using amounts disclosed in our consolidated financial statements, as many of the calculations involve monthly, quarterly or annual averages. To calculate our liquidity ratios, the average liquidity base from the prior month is used as the denominator to calculate a daily liquidity ratio. The liquidity base consists of savings account balances, certificates of deposit balances, checking and money market balances, deposit loans and borrowings. The daily balances of these components are averaged to arrive at the liquidity base for the month, and the daily cash balances in selected general ledger accounts are used to derive our liquidity position. A daily liquidity ratio is calculated using the liquidity for the day divided by the prior month s average liquidity base. At the end of each month, a monthly liquidity position is calculated using the average liquidity position for the month divided by the prior month s average liquidity base. To calculate quarterly and annual liquidity ratios, we take the average liquidity for the three- or twelve-month period, respectively, and average it. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities, other short-term investments, earnings, and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included with our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our primary investing activities are the origination of construction loans, commercial and industrial loans, multifamily loans, and to a lesser extent, mixed-use real estate loans and other loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our loan originations totaled 569.2 million and 653.0 million, respectively. Cash received from the maturities and pay-downs on securities totaled 805,000 and 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We purchased 2.0 million in equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to no purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York to provide advances. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. We had an available borrowing limit of 14.8 million and 29.7 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were 7.0 million and 14.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York FRBNY approved on August 30, 2023 the Bank s eligibility to pledge loans under the Borrower-in-Custody program of the FRBNY thereby allowing the Bank to borrow from the Discount Window at the FRBNY. We had an available borrowing limit of 832.1 million and 865.1 million from the FRBNY as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had no FRBNY borrowings at September 30, 2024 compared to 50.0 million in FRBNY borrowings at December 31, 2023. In addition, we are party to a loan agreement with ACBB under which we can borrow up to 8.0 million in short-term borrowings. There were no outstanding borrowings with ACBB at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments on construction and multi-family mortgage loans of 446.2 million, outstanding commitments to originate loans of 116.5 million, unfunded commitments under lines of credit of 

 48 

Table of Contents 
 83.8 million, and unfunded standby letters of credit of 12.5 million. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled 874.1 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us, we will have to utilize other funding sources, such as various types of sourced deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, or Federal Reserve Bank borrowings, in order to maintain our level of assets. Alternatively, we could reduce our level of liquid assets, such as our cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher or lower depending on market interest rates at the time of renewal. The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its stockholders and for the repurchase, if any, of its shares of common stock. At September 30, 2024, the Company had liquid assets of 4.0 million and 14.1 million in loan participations originated by the Bank which are held by the Company. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash-flows. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The consolidated financial statements and related notes of NorthEast Community Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure to current and future earnings and capital that arises from adverse movements in interest rates. Depending on a bank s asset/liability structure, adverse movements in interest rates could be either rising or falling interest rates. For example, a bank with predominantly long-term fixed-rate assets and short-term liabilities could have an adverse earnings exposure to a rising rate environment. Conversely, a short-term or variable-rate asset base funded by longer-term liabilities could be negatively affected by falling rates. This is referred to as re-pricing or maturity mismatch risk. Interest rate risk also arises from changes in the slope of the yield curve (yield curve risk), from imperfect correlations in the adjustment of rates earned and paid on different instruments with otherwise similar re-pricing characteristics (basis risk), and from interest rate related options embedded in our assets and liabilities (option risk). Our objective is to manage our interest rate risk by determining whether a given movement in interest rates affects our net interest income and the market value of our portfolio equity in a positive or negative way and to execute strategies to maintain interest rate risk within established limits. The results at September 30, 2024 indicate the level of risk within the parameters of our model. Our management believes that the September 30, 2024 results indicate a profile that reflects interest rate risk exposures in both rising and declining rate environments for both net interest income and economic value. Model Simulation Analysis. We view interest rate risk from two different perspectives. The traditional accounting perspective, which defines and measures interest rate risk as the change in net interest income and earnings caused by a change in interest rates, provides the best view of short-term interest rate risk exposure. We also view interest rate risk from an economic perspective, which defines and measures interest rate risk as the change in the market value of portfolio equity caused by changes in the values of assets and liabilities, which fluctuate due to changes in interest rates. The market value of portfolio equity, also referred to as the economic value of equity, is defined as the present value of future cash flows from existing assets, minus the present value of future cash flows from existing liabilities. 

 49 

Table of Contents 
 These two perspectives give rise to income simulation and economic value simulation, each of which presents a unique picture of our risk of any movement in interest rates. Income simulation identifies the timing and magnitude of changes in income resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates over a short-term time horizon (usually one or two years). Economic value simulation reflects the interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities in a more comprehensive fashion, reflecting all future time periods. It can identify the quantity of interest rate risk as a function of the changes in the economic values of assets and liabilities, and the corresponding change in the economic value of equity of NorthEast Community Bank. Both types of simulation assist in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate risk and are employed by management to ensure that variations in interest rate risk exposure will be maintained within policy guidelines. We produce these simulation reports and discuss them at our Asset and Liability Committee meetings on at least a quarterly basis. The simulation reports compare baseline (no interest rate change) to the results of an interest rate shock, to illustrate the specific impact of the interest rate scenario tested on income and equity. The model, which incorporates asset and liability rate information, simulates the effect of various interest rate movements on income and equity value. The reports identify and measure our interest rate risk exposure present in our current asset/liability structure. Management considers both a static (current position) and dynamic (forecast changes in volume) analysis as well as non-parallel and gradual changes in interest rates and the yield curve in assessing interest rate exposures. If the results produce quantifiable interest rate risk exposure beyond our limits, then the testing will have served as a monitoring mechanism to allow us to initiate asset/liability strategies designed to reduce and therefore mitigate interest rate risk. The table below sets forth an approximation of our interest rate risk exposure. The simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024. The income simulation analysis presented represents a one-year impact of the interest scenario assuming a static balance sheet. Various assumptions are made regarding the prepayment speed and optionality of loans, investment securities and deposits, which are based on analysis and market information. The assumptions regarding optionality, such as prepayments of loans and the effective lives and repricing of non-maturity deposit products, are documented periodically through evaluation of current market conditions and historical correlations to our specific asset and liability products under varying interest rate scenarios. Because the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions, these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. While we believe such assumptions to be reasonable, assumed prepayment rates may not approximate actual future prepayment activity on mortgage-backed securities or agency issued collateralized obligations (secured by one- to four-family loans and multifamily loans). Further, the computation does not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates and assumes a constant asset base. Management periodically reviews the rate assumptions based on existing and projected economic conditions and consults with industry experts to validate our model and simulation results. The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, NorthEast Community Bank s net portfolio value, the estimated changes in our net portfolio value and net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel changes in market interest rates. 

Twelve Month Net Interest Income Net Portfolio Value Percent Percent Change in Interest Rates (Basis Points) of Change Estimated NPV of Change +200 18.02 342,532 4.29 +100 9.12 335,975 2.29 0 328,447 -100 (10.00) 317,911 (3.21) -200 (20.09) 305,155 (7.09) As of September 30, 2024, based on the scenarios above, net interest income would increase by approximately 9.12 to 18.02 , over a one-year time horizon in a rising interest rate environment. One-year net interest income would decrease by approximately 10.00 to 20.09 in a declining interest rate environment over the same period. Economic value at risk would be positively impacted by a rise in interest rates and negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates. We have established an interest rate floor of zero percent for measuring interest rate risk. The 

 50 

Table of Contents 
 difference between the two results reflects the relatively long terms of a portion of our assets which is captured by the economic value at risk but has less impact on the one year net interest income sensitivity. Overall, our September 30, 2024 results indicate that we are adequately positioned with an acceptable net interest income and economic value at risk and that all interest rate risk results continue to be within our policy guidelines. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure (1) that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms; and (2) that they are alerted in a timely manner about material information relating to the Company required to be filed in its periodic Securities and Exchange Commission filings. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition. Item 1A. Risk Factors For information regarding the Company s risk factors, refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the risk factors of the Company have not changed materially from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On May 30, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 1,509,218 shares, or 10 , of the Company's currently issued and outstanding common stock commencing on May 30, 2023. The stock repurchase program is the Company s second repurchase program since completing its second-step conversion and related stock offering in July 2021.
