 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains information that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of words such as may, believe, could, will, expect, outlook, potential, project, estimate, future, intend, anticipate, plan, continue or similar expressions. However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results are forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to realize the expected benefits from the sale of the global Champion business, which was completed subsequent to our third quarter on September 30, 2024; our ability to successfully operate the Champion business in certain sectors and geographies through a transition period ending on January 31, 2025, and to execute, and realize the expected benefits, successfully, or at all, from the sale of certain remaining assets of the global Champion business at the end of this transition period; our ability to successfully implement our strategic plans, including our supply chain restructuring and consolidation and other cost savings initiatives; trends associated with our business; the rapidly changing retail environment and the level of consumer demand; the effects of any geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and Middle East conflicts) or public health emergencies or severe global health crises, including effects on consumer spending, global supply chains, critical supply routes and the financial markets; our ability to deleverage on the anticipated time frame or at all, which could negatively impact our ability to satisfy the financial covenants in our credit agreement or other contractual arrangements; any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology; future intangible assets or goodwill impairment due to changes in our business, market conditions, or other factors, including the sale of the global Champion business; significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; legal, regulatory, political and economic risks related to our international operations; our ability to effectively manage our complex international tax structure; and our future financial performance. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Such statements speak only as of the date when made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 More information on factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated is included from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, under the caption Risk Factors , and available on the Investors section of our corporate website, www.Hanes.com/investors .

 U.S. Sheer Hosiery Business - Continuing Operations 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company reached the decision to divest its U.S. Sheer Hosiery business, including the L eggs brand, as part of its strategy to streamline its portfolio under its Full Potential transformation plan and determined that this business met held-for-sale accounting criteria. The Company recorded a non-cash charge in the fourth quarter of 2021 against the net assets held for sale to write down the carrying value of the disposal group to the estimated fair value less costs of disposal. In 2022, the Company recorded a non-cash gain to adjust the valuation allowance primarily resulting from a decrease in carrying value due to changes in working capital. In the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a gain of and a loss, net of proceeds, of , respectively, which are reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, associated with the sale of the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business and adjustments to the related valuation allowance prior to the sale primarily resulting from changes in carrying value due to changes in working capital.

 Discontinued Operations 
 In the second quarter of 2024, the Company reached the decision to exit the global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses and determined that the exit of these two businesses represented multiple components of a single strategic plan that met held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria at the end of the second quarter of 2024. Accordingly, the Company began to separately report the results of the global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses as discontinued operations in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and to present the related assets and liabilities as held for sale in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, certain expenses related to the operations of the global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses were included in general corporate expenses, restructuring and other action-related charges and amortization of intangibles, which were previously excluded from segment operating profit, and have been reclassified to discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2024. These changes have been applied to all periods presented. See Note Basis of Presentation for additional information.

At the end of the transition period, Authentic will purchase from the Company certain remaining assets of the Deferred Business. The global Champion business sale transaction excluded the operating assets of the Champion business in Japan, and the Company will continue to operate the Champion business in Japan as a licensee of Authentic pursuant to the terms of a license agreement entered into at the Initial Closing. The Company used net sale proceeds from the Initial Closing of , which excludes customary transaction costs and other deductions permitted under the Company s senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility ), to pay down a portion of the Company s outstanding term debt in October 2024.

In July 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Restore Capital (HCR Stores), LLC Restore ), an affiliate of Hilco Merchant Resources, LLC, and completed the exit of the U.S.-based outlet store business. Under the purchase agreement, the Company agreed to pay Restore at closing and an additional in January 2025 and to provide certain inventory to Restore, in exchange for Restore agreeing to assume the operations and certain liabilities of the Company s U.S.-based outlet store business. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had a valuation allowance of for the full balance of the remaining inventory that had not yet been transferred to Restore. The remaining inventory balance as of September 28, 2024 is reflected in the Inventories line and the offsetting valuation allowance is reflected in the Valuation allowance - U.S.-based outlet store business line in the Assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations of the global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses table below.

Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the net assets held for sale, which were primarily current assets, to adjust the carrying value of the U.S.-based outlet store business to the estimated fair value less costs of disposal. In the quarter and nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash gain of and a non-cash charge of , respectively, associated with the sale of the U.S.-based outlet store business and adjustments to the related valuation allowance prior to the sale, primarily resulting from a decrease in carrying value due to changes in working capital in the quarter ended September 28, 2024.

 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD ), an international association of 38 countries including the U.S., has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, including a global minimum tax initiative. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the OECD s Pillar 2 global corporate minimum tax rate of 15 on companies with revenues of at least 790,000, which went into effect in 2024.

Any gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized directly into earnings. Gains or losses on these contracts largely offset the net remeasurement gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities.

 Overview 
 Hanesbrands Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, we, us, our, or the Company is a socially responsible global leader in branded everyday apparel in the Americas, Australia and Asia, under some of the world s strongest apparel brands, including Hanes , Bonds , Bali , Maidenform , Bras N Things , Playtex, Wonderbra , Berlei , Comfortwash and JMS/Just My Size . We primarily design, manufacture, source and sell a broad range of innerwear apparel, such as T-shirts, bras, panties, shapewear, underwear and socks, as well as other apparel products that are manufactured or sourced in our low-cost global supply chain. Our products are broadly distributed and available to consumers where, when and how they want to shop, including in mass merchants, mid-tier and department stores, specialty stores, company-owned retail stores as well as e-commerce sites, both retailer and company-owned websites. Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs and wants of various consumer segments across a broad range of basic apparel products and our brands have strong consumer positioning that helps distinguish them from competitors. 
 Our Key Business Strategies 
 Our business strategy integrates our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost global supply chain to provide higher value products while lowering production costs. We operate primarily in the global innerwear apparel category, along with smaller operations within other apparel categories. These are stable, heavily branded categories where we have a strong consumer franchise based on a global portfolio of industry-leading brands that we have built over multiple decades, through hundreds of millions of direct interactions with consumers. Our business strategy is based on becoming a consumer-focused company that generates consistent growth and returns over time. We are focused to re-energize and reignite our Innerwear business by delivering consumer-driven innovation and attracting younger consumers; to become a more consumer-focused organization that delivers products consumers want; and, to simplify our business and our portfolio. The key enablers to unlock our growth opportunities include restructuring and consolidating our global supply chain, increasing revenue-generating investments in our brands, technology and people, as well as building a winning culture. 
 Over the last three years, we have experienced several unanticipated challenges, including significant cost inflation, market disruption and consumer-demand headwinds. Despite the challenging global operating environment, we have been able to balance the near-term management of the business with making the long-term investments necessary to execute our strategy and transform the Company. During this time, we have made meaningful progress on several of our strategic initiatives. We have pivoted our U.S. Innerwear business back to gaining market share, which has been driven by the launch of new product innovation, increased marketing investments in our brands and improved on-shelf product availability. We have simplified our portfolio by selling our European Innerwear and U.S. Sheer Hosiery businesses. We have also simplified our business by improving inventory management capabilities, including SKU reduction and disciplined lifecycle management, as well as globalizing our innerwear design and innovation processes. We have segmented our supply chain, which has reduced lead times, improved efficiencies and reduced costs and most recently, we have begun implementing a significant restructuring and consolidation initiative to further simplify and reduce cost within our supply chain and corporate functions within the continuing operations to drive stronger operating performance and margin expansion. We have also increased investments in brand marketing, technology, digital tools and talent. We remain highly confident that our strong brand portfolio, world-class supply chain and diverse category and geographic footprint will help us deliver long-term growth and create stockholder value over time.

 In September 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors and executive leadership team, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, were undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives for the global Champion business. As part of this process, the Board of Directors considered a broad range of alternatives to maximize shareholder value and also considered an evaluation of the strategic alternatives for the U.S.-based outlet store business impacted by the global Champion business. In the second quarter of 2024, we reached the decision to exit the global Champion business and our U.S.-based outlet store business. At that time, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell the intellectual property and certain operating assets of the global Champion business to Authentic Brands Group LLC Authentic ). Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, we completed the sale of the intellectual property and certain operating assets of the global Champion business to Authentic subsequent to our third quarter on September 30, 2024 (the Initial Closing in exchange for gross cash proceeds of 857 million and a receivable of 12 million. In addition, we have the potential to receive additional contingent cash consideration of up to 300 million pursuant to the agreement. We will continue to provide certain transition services to Authentic pursuant to the terms of a Transition Services Agreement entered into among the Company, Authentic and the applicable service recipients and will continue to operate the Champion business in certain sectors and geographies through a transition period ending on January 31, 2025 (the Deferred Business ). At the end of the transition period, Authentic will purchase from us certain remaining assets of the Deferred Business. The global Champion business sale transaction excluded the operating assets of the Champion business in Japan and we will continue to operate the Champion business in Japan as a licensee of Authentic pursuant to the terms of a license agreement entered into at the Initial Closing. We used net sale proceeds from the Initial Closing of 783 million, which excludes customary transaction costs and other deductions permitted under our senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility ), to pay down a portion of our outstanding term debt in October 2024. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we began actively marketing our U.S.-based outlet store business to prospective buyers. In July 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with Restore Capital (HCR Stores), LLC Restore ), an affiliate of Hilco Merchant Resources, LLC and completed the exit of our U.S.-based outlet store business. Under the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay Restore 12 million at closing and an additional 3 million in January 2025 and to provide certain inventory to Restore, in exchange for Restore agreeing to assume the operations and certain liabilities of our U.S.-based outlet store business. The agreement with Restore did not include the Champion -branded U.S. retail stores, which were addressed in accordance with the purchase agreement governing the sale of the global Champion business to Authentic, which was completed subsequent to our third quarter on September 30, 2024. 
 We determined that the exit of the global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses represented multiple components of a single strategic plan that met held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria at the end of the second quarter of 2024. Accordingly, we began to separately report the results of the global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and to present the related assets and liabilities as held for sale in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These changes have been applied to all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion within this MD A relates to continuing operations. See Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information about discontinued operations. 
 As previously disclosed, we completed the sale of our U.S. Sheer Hosiery business on September 29, 2023. The operations of our U.S. Sheer Hosiery business were reported in Other for the third quarter and nine months of 2023 in Note Business Segment Information to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 We seek to generate strong cash flow through effectively optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels. In January 2023, we shifted our capital allocation strategy to focus the use of all our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) on reducing debt and bringing our leverage back to a range that is no greater than two to three times on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding restructuring and other action-related costs and certain other losses, charges and expenses. Net debt is defined as the total of current debt, long-term debt, and borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facility (excluding long-term debt issuance costs) less other debt and cash adjustments and cash and cash equivalents.

 Our Segments 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we realigned our segment reporting as a result of the pending sale of the global Champion business, which was completed subsequent to our third quarter on September 30, 2024, as discussed in Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While the global Champion business was reflected within all reportable segments prior to its reclassification to discontinued operations, the U.S. Champion business made up the majority of our former Activewear segment. Accordingly, the former Activewear segment has been eliminated and the segment information herein excludes the results of the global Champion business for all periods presented. As a result of the strategic shift and resulting reorganization, the chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, began reviewing all U.S. innerwear and U.S. activewear operations together as one U.S. operating segment. As a result of these changes, our operations are now managed and reported in two operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: U.S. and International. These changes have been applied to all periods presented. These segments are organized and managed principally by geographic location. Each segment has its own management team that is responsible for the operations of the segment s businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. 
 Other consists of our U.S. Sheer Hosiery business prior to its sale on September 29, 2023, certain sales from our supply chain to the European Innerwear business which was sold on March 5, 2022, short term transition service agreements and support of disposed businesses. Our U.S.-based outlet store business was also reflected in Other prior to its reclassification to discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2024 as discussed in Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As a result of this reclassification, the results of the U.S.-based outlet store business are excluded from the segment information herein for all periods presented. 
 Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the third quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. In connection with the annual impairment analysis, we perform a quantitative assessment utilizing an income approach to estimate the fair values of its reporting units and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. The most significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the reporting units and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets include the weighted average cost of capital, revenue growth rate, terminal growth rate and operating profit margin. 
 During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, we completed our annual quantitative impairment analysis for each reporting unit and the respective goodwill balances. The analysis indicated that all reporting units had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 at the time the analysis was performed. 
 We also completed our annual quantitative impairment analysis for certain indefinite-lived intangible assets during the quarter ended September 28, 2024. While the analysis indicated that those indefinite-lived intangible assets had fair values that exceeded their carrying values, we noted a meaningful decline in the fair value cushion above the carrying value for one of the indefinite-lived trademarks within the Australian business. The decline in this trademark was driven by continued macroeconomic pressures impacting consumer spending in Australia and resulted in a fair value that exceeded the carrying value by approximately 10 at the time the analysis was performed. As a result, this trademark was considered to be at a higher risk for future impairment if economic conditions worsen or earnings and operating cash flows do not recover as currently estimated by management. As of September 28, 2024, the carrying value of this trademark was approximately 239 million. 
 Although we determined that no impairment existed for our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 28, 2024, these assets could be at risk for future impairment due to changes in our business or global economic conditions. 
 Ransomware Attack 
 As previously disclosed, on May 24, 2022, we identified that we had become subject to a ransomware attack that affected certain of our information technology systems. The incident was subsequently investigated and contained and there are no ongoing operational impacts on our ability to provide our products and services. We maintain insurance, including coverage for cyber-attacks, subject to certain deductibles and policy limitations, in an amount that we believe appropriate.

 During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a benefit related to business interruption insurance proceeds of approximately 18 million, of which 15 million was received during the third quarter of 2023. During the nine months of 2023, we recognized a benefit related to business interruption insurance proceeds of approximately 24 million, of which approximately 21 million was received during the nine months of 2023. The remaining receivable for the expected final payment was recognized in the Other current assets line in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and was received in October 2023. The business interruption insurance proceeds received were primarily related to the recovery of lost profit from business interruptions. We recognized a benefit of approximately 18 million and 23 million, respectively, for the business interruption insurance proceeds in the Cost of sales line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter and nine months of 2023. We recognized a benefit of approximately 1 million for the reimbursement of costs related primarily to legal fees in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the nine months of 2023. 
 Impact of the Macroeconomic Pressures on Our Business 
 The global macroeconomic pressures continue to impact our business operations and financial results, as described in more detail under Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations - Third Quarter Ended September 28, 2024 Compared with Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 and Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 below, primarily through consumer-demand headwinds and increased interest rates which has pressured sales and resulted in higher operating and financing costs causing pressure on net operating results. Despite the challenging global operating environment, we have been able to balance near term management of the business with implementing changes to execute our strategy to transform the Company. We have simplified the business by improving inventory management capabilities through continued SKU discipline and lifecycle management. Gross and operating margin pressures began to ease in the second half of 2023 and continued in 2024 as lower cost inventory was sold and we benefited from various cost savings initiatives. The future impact of the global macroeconomic pressures, including consumer demand headwinds and higher interest rates, remain highly uncertain, and our business and results of operations, including our net revenues, earnings and cash flows, could continue to be adversely impacted. The Federal Reserve cut the federal-funds rate in September 2024 and is expected to have further cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024. While these cuts could potentially have a favorable impact to consumer spending, we remain highly uncertain as the near term impact on interest rates is not yet known. See the related risk factors under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
 Seasonality and Other Factors 
 Our operating results are typically subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For instance, we have historically generated higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, typically mitigates some of the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by our customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels of our categories in response to anticipated consumer demand or the overall inventory levels of their other product categories. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions. 
 Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary consumer spending trends. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Consumers purchases of discretionary items, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products, to purchase lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time.

 Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, including cotton, dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Disruptions to the global supply chain due to factory closures, port congestion, transportation delays as well as labor and container shortages may negatively impact product availability, revenue growth and gross margins. We would work to mitigate the impact of the global supply chain disruptions through a combination of cost savings and operating efficiencies, as well as pricing actions, which could have an adverse impact on demand. Costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the finished goods inventory is sold. In addition, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the United States and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. Increases in inflation may not be matched by growth in consumer income, which also could have a negative impact on spending. 
 Changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products, such as intimate apparel and men s underwear, and lower margin products, such as basic apparel, fluctuate from time to time. In addition, sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time. Our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us, which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict. However, certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature, as sales of socks generally have higher sales during the last two quarters (July to December) of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather, back-to-school shopping and holidays, while other changes in product mix may be attributable to consumers preferences and discretionary spending. 
 Key Financial Results from the Third Quarter Ended September 28, 2024 
 Key financial results are as follows: 
 Total net sales in the third quarter of 2024 were 937 million, compared with 961 million in the same period of 2023, representing a 3 decrease. 
 Operating profit increased 27.1 to 103 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with 81 million in the same period of 2023. As a percentage of sales, operating profit increased to 11.0 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 8.4 in the same period of 2023. 
 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 0.09 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with diluted loss per share of (0.02) in the same period of 2023.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales decreased 3 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the divestiture of the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business on September 29, 2023 and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates in our International business of approximately 7 million. 
 Operating Profit 
 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 11.0 during the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase from 8.4 in the third quarter of 2023. The operating margin improvement primarily resulted from approximately 565 basis points from the reduction in input costs, approximately 185 basis points from the savings realized from continued improvement in our supply chain and approximately 60 basis points from our product assortment management initiative. This was partially offset by an increase in restructuring and other action-related charges included in operating profit to 19 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3 million in the third quarter of 2023, which resulted in an unfavorable impact to operating margin of approximately 415 basis points. In addition, the operating margin improvement was partially offset by approximately 150 basis points due to increased brand investments. 
 Other Highlights 
 Other Expenses Other expenses increased slightly in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher pension expense partially offset by lower funding fees for sales of accounts receivable to financial institutions in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Interest Expense Interest expense from continuing operations was 49 million and 57 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of approximately 8 million. The interest expense from continuing operations excludes 17 million in both of the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, which was allocated to discontinued operations due to the requirement to pay down a portion of our outstanding term debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facility with the net proceeds from the sale of the global Champion business. Combined interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations decreased 9 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to lower weighted average outstanding debt balances partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate on our borrowings during the third quarter of 2024. Our combined weighted average interest rate, including the portion of interest expense that was allocated to discontinued operations, on our outstanding debt was 7.50 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 7.45 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 Income Tax Expense In the third quarter of 2024, income tax expense was 13 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 27.9 and in the third quarter of 2023, income tax expense was 21 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 139.1 . Our effective tax rates for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 primarily differ from the U.S. statutory rate due to valuation allowances against certain net deferred tax assets. Additionally, we had unfavorable discrete items of 1 million in the third quarter of 2024 and favorable discrete items of 4 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Discontinued Operations The results of our discontinued operations include the operations of our global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses which we reached the decision to exit in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of our announcement that we reached an agreement to sell the global Champion business to Authentic. See Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to discontinued operations.

 U.S. 
 U.S. net sales decreased 1 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to softer point-of-sale trends stemming from the continued macroeconomic pressures in the U.S. segment. 
 U.S. operating margin was 22.1 , an increase from 15.4 in the third quarter of 2023. The operating margin improvement primarily resulted from approximately 670 basis points from the reduction in input costs and approximately 260 basis points from the savings realized from continued improvement in our supply chain partially offset by approximately 210 basis points of increased brand investments. 
 International 
 Net sales in the International segment increased 1 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to growth in the Americas and Asia, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased net sales by approximately 7 million in the third quarter of 2024. International net sales on a constant currency basis, defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, increased 4 . The impact of foreign currency exchange rates is calculated by applying prior period exchange rates to the current year financial results. We believe constant-currency information is useful to management and investors to facilitate comparison of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses. 
 International operating margin was 14.2 , an increase from 9.6 in the third quarter of 2023. The operating margin improvement primarily resulted from approximately 220 basis points from the reduction in input costs and approximately 320 basis points due to benefits from cost savings initiatives. 
 Other 
 Sales and operating results in the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflect short term transition service agreements and support of disposed businesses. Sales and operating results in the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflect the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business which was sold on September 29, 2023 and certain sales from our supply chain to the European Innerwear business which was sold on March 5, 2022. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate expenses included in operating profit were higher in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher restructuring and other action-related charges and the receipt of a portion of our business interruption insurance proceeds during the third quarter of 2023 related to the ransomware attack which occurred during the second quarter of 2022. 
 As a result of and related to the sale of the global Champion business, which was completed subsequent to our third quarter on September 30, 2024, and the completed exit of the U.S.-based outlet store business in July 2024, we began implementing significant restructuring and consolidation efforts within our supply chain network, both manufacturing and distribution, as well as corporate cost and headcount reductions to align our network and improve our overall cost structure within continuing operations to drive stronger operating performance and margin expansion. 
 Restructuring and other action-related charges within operating profit were 19 million and 3 million in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, as described in more detail below. 
 Supply chain restructuring and consolidation charges in the third quarter of 2024 were 11 million, which primarily included charges of 6 million for accelerated amortization of right of use assets for leased facilities that we expect to exit before the end of the contractual lease term and 2 million for headcount actions and related severance related to restructuring and consolidation efforts within our supply chain network.

Table of Contents 

 Charges related to professional services primarily including consulting and advisory services related to restructuring activities were 8 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 We recognized a net gain of 1 million, primarily related to the reversal of accruals, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to charges of 3 million in the third quarter of 2023 related to headcount actions and related severance resulting from operating model initiatives. 
 Restructuring and other action-related charges in the third quarter of 2023 included a gain of 2 million associated with the sale of the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business on September 29, 2023 and adjustments to the related valuation allowance prior to the sale primarily resulting from changes in carrying value due to changes in working capital. See Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business. 
 The remaining restructuring and other action-related charges within operating profit are primarily associated with technology charges, which relate to the implementation of our technology modernization initiative including the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning platform, and other restructuring and action-related charges. Supply chain restructuring and consolidation charges in the third quarter of 2023 represent supply chain segmentation to restructure and position our distribution and manufacturing network to align with our demand trends. 
 Restructuring and other action-related charges in the third quarter of 2023 included discrete tax benefits representing an adjustment to non-cash reserves established at December 31, 2022 related to deferred taxes established for Swiss statutory impairments, which are not indicative of our core operations. 
 During the third quarter of 2023, we recognized a benefit related to business interruption insurance proceeds of approximately 18 million, of which 15 million was received in the third quarter of 2023. The business interruption insurance proceeds received were primarily related to the recovery of lost profit from business interruptions and are reflected in the Cost of sales line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the third quarter of 2023.

 Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Higher (Lower) Percent Change (dollars in thousands) Net sales 2,710,709 2,880,328 (169,619) (5.9) Cost of sales 1,703,881 1,891,375 (187,494) (9.9) Gross profit 1,006,828 988,953 17,875 1.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 927,851 812,446 115,405 14.2 Operating profit 78,977 176,507 (97,530) (55.3) Other expenses 29,519 31,056 (1,537) (4.9) Interest expense, net 149,511 160,586 (11,075) (6.9) Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (100,053) (15,135) (84,918) 561.1 Income tax expense 34,723 50,286 (15,563) (30.9) Loss from continuing operations (134,776) (65,421) (69,355) 106.0 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (172,775) (30,246) (142,529) 471.2 Net loss (307,551) (95,667) (211,884) 221.5 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales decreased 6 during the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of 2023 primarily due to the divestiture of the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business on September 29, 2023, a higher than anticipated level of inventory management actions by select retailers in the U.S. segment, the unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates in our International business of approximately 38 million and the continued macro-driven slowdown impacting consumer spending across segments. 
 Operating Profit 
 Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 2.9 during the nine months of 2024, representing a decrease from 6.1 in the nine months of 2023. The operating margin decline primarily resulted from an increase in restructuring and other action-related charges included in operating profit to 223 million in the nine months of 2024 from 22 million in the nine months of 2023, which resulted in a decline in operating margin of approximately 745 basis points. In addition, the operating margin decline resulted from approximately 155 basis points of increased brand investments partially offset by approximately 560 basis points from the reduction in input costs. 
 Other Highlights 
 Other Expenses Other expenses decreased 2 million in the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of 2023 primarily due to recording charges of nearly 9 million as a result of the redemption of our 4.625 Senior Notes and our 3.5 Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2023. The charges included a payment of 5 million for a required make-whole premium related to the redemption of the 3.5 Senior Notes and non-cash charges of 4 million for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. See Note Debt to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. This decrease in other expenses was partially offset by higher funding fees for sales of accounts receivable to financial institutions and higher pension expense in the nine months of 2024. 
 Interest Expense Interest expense from continuing operations was 150 million and 161 million in the nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a decrease of 11 million. The interest expense from continuing operations excludes 53 million and 48 million in the nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was allocated to discontinued operations due to the requirement to pay down a portion of outstanding term debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facility with the net proceeds from the sale of the global Champion business. Additionally, in conjunction with the redemption of the 3.5 Senior Notes described in Other Expenses above, we unwound the related cross-currency swap contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges and the remaining gain in AOCI of 1 million was released into earnings at the time of settlement which partially offset interest expense in the nine months of 2023. See Note Financial Instruments and Risk Management to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. Combined interest expense from continuing and discontinued operations decreased 9 million in the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of 2023 primarily due to lower weighted average outstanding debt balances partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate on our borrowings during the nine months of 2024. Our combined weighted average interest rate, including the portion of interest expense that was allocated to discontinued operations, on our outstanding debt was 7.56 for the nine months of 2024 compared to 6.81 for the nine months of 2023.

 Income Tax Expense In the nine months of 2024, income tax expense was 35 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of (34.7) and in the nine months of 2023, income tax expense was 50 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of (332.2) . Our effective tax rates for the nine months of 2024 and the nine months of 2023 primarily differ from the U.S. statutory rate due to valuation allowances against certain net deferred tax assets. Additionally, we had minimal favorable discrete items in the nine months of 2024 and unfavorable discrete items of 4 million in the nine months of 2023. 
 Discontinued Operations The results of our discontinued operations include the operations of our global Champion and U.S.-based outlet store businesses which we reached the decision to exit in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of our announcement that we reached an agreement to sell the global Champion business to Authentic. See Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to discontinued operations.

 U.S. 
 U.S. net sales decreased 4 compared to the nine months of 2023 primarily due to softer point-of-sale trends stemming from the continued macroeconomic pressures and higher than anticipated level of inventory management actions by select retailers. 
 U.S. operating margin was 20.7 , an increase from 14.6 in the nine months of 2023. The operating margin improvement primarily resulted from approximately 665 basis points from a reduction in input costs partially offset by approximately 210 basis points of increased brand investments. 
 International 
 Net sales in the International segment decreased 4 compared to the nine months of 2023 due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and macroeconomic pressures impacting consumer sentiment in Australia, partially offset by growth in the Americas and Asia. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased net sales approximately 38 million in the nine months of 2024. International net sales on a constant currency basis, defined as net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, increased 1 . The impact of foreign currency exchange rates is calculated by applying prior period exchange rates to the current year financial results. We believe constant-currency information is useful to management and investors to facilitate comparison of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses. 
 International operating margin was 11.8 , an increase from 8.9 in the nine months of 2023. The operating margin improvement primarily resulted from approximately 215 basis points from a reduction in input costs.

Table of Contents 

 Other 
 Other net sales decreased in the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of 2023 primarily as a result of decreased hosiery sales as we completed the sale of our U.S. Sheer Hosiery business on September 29, 2023. Sales and operating results in the nine months of 2024 primarily reflect short term transition service agreements and support of disposed businesses. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate expenses included in operating profit were higher in the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of 2023 primarily due to higher restructuring and other action-related charges and the receipt of a portion of our business interruption insurance proceeds during the nine months of 2023 related to the ransomware attack which occurred during the second quarter of 2022. 
 As a result of and related to the sale of the global Champion business, which was completed subsequent to our third quarter on September 30, 2024, and the completed exit of the U.S.-based outlet store business in July 2024, we began implementing significant restructuring and consolidation efforts within our supply chain network, both manufacturing and distribution, as well as corporate cost and headcount reductions to align our network and improve our overall cost structure within continuing operations to drive stronger operating performance and margin expansion. 
 Restructuring and other action-related charges within operating profit were 223 million and 22 million in the nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, as described in more detail below. 
 Supply chain restructuring and consolidation charges in the nine months of 2024 were 170 million, which primarily included charges of: 
 80 million reflected in the Cost of sales line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily related to charges of 48 million to write down inventory as a result of further SKU rationalization efforts and 26 million for severance and related employee actions for impacted supply chain facilities and 
 90 million reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily related to charges of 72 million for impairment of an owned facility that was classified as held for sale and a right of use asset for which the leased facility was not in operation, 8 million for accelerated amortization of right of use assets for leased facilities that we expect to exit before the end of the contractual lease term and 6 million for headcount actions and related severance related to restructuring and consolidation efforts within our supply chain network. 
 Corporate asset impairment charges in the nine months of 2024 were 20 million, which included charges of 10 million reflected in the Cost of sales line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily related to a contract termination and 10 million reflected in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations primarily related to charges for impairment of our headquarters location sold in the nine months of 2024. 
 Charges related to headcount actions and related severance resulting from operating model initiatives were 18 million and 4 million in the nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Charges related to professional services primarily including consulting and advisory services related to restructuring activities were 12 million and 4 million in the nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Restructuring and other action-related charges in the nine months of 2023 included a loss, net of proceeds, of 4 million associated with the sale of the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business on September 29, 2023 and adjustments to the related valuation allowance prior to the sale primarily resulting from changes in carrying value due to changes in working capital. See Note Assets and Liabilities of Businesses Held for Sale to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding the U.S. Sheer Hosiery business. 
 The remaining restructuring and other action-related charges within operating profit are primarily associated with technology charges, which relate to the implementation of our technology modernization initiative including the implementation of a global enterprise resource planning platform and other restructuring and action-related charges. Supply chain restructuring and consolidation charges in the nine months of 2023 represent supply chain segmentation to restructure and position our distribution and manufacturing network to align with our demand trends. 
 Restructuring and other action-related charges in the nine months of 2023 included discrete tax benefits representing an adjustment to non-cash reserves established at December 31, 2022 related to deferred taxes established for Swiss statutory impairments, which are not indicative of our core operations.

 During the nine months of 2023, we recognized a benefit related to business interruption insurance proceeds of approximately 24 million, of which approximately 21 million was received during the nine months of 2023. The business interruption insurance proceeds received were primarily related to the recovery of lost profit from business interruptions. We recognized a benefit of approximately 23 million for the business interruption insurance proceeds in the Cost of sales line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the nine months of 2023. We recognized a benefit of approximately 1 million for the reimbursement of costs related primarily to legal fees in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the nine months of 2023. 
 The components of restructuring and other action-related charges were as follows:

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Requirements and Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity 
 We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business. In January 2023, we shifted our capital allocation strategy to utilize our cash from operations for payments to our employees and vendors in the normal course of business and to reinvest in our business through capital expenditures. We then utilize our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to pay down debt to bring our leverage back to a range that is no greater than two to three times on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. 
 Based on our current expectations and forecasts of future earnings and cash flows, we believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings to support our operations and key business strategies for at least the next 12 months and we currently believe our cash flows and available borrowings, together with our access to the capital markets, are sufficient to support our longer term liquidity needs as well. 
 Our primary financing arrangements are our Senior Secured Credit Facility, our 9.000 senior notes due in 2031 (the 9.000 Senior Notes ), our 4.875 senior notes due in 2026 (the 4.875 Senior Notes and our accounts receivable securitization facility due in 2025 (the ARS Facility ). The Senior Secured Credit Facility consists of a 1 billion revolving loan facility due in 2026 (the Revolving Loan Facility ), a senior secured term loan A facility due in 2026 (the Term Loan A ), and a senior secured term loan B facility due in 2030 (the Term Loan B ). 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from global operations and cash available under our Revolving Loan Facility, our ARS Facility and our other international credit facilities.

Table of Contents 

 We had the following borrowing capacity and available liquidity under our credit facilities as of September 28, 2024: 
 As of September 28, 2024 Borrowing Capacity Available Liquidity (dollars in thousands) Senior Secured Credit Facility: Revolving Loan Facility (1) 
 1,000,000 996,743 Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility (2) 
 106,480 106,480 Other international credit facilities (3)

 (1) A portion of the Revolving Loan Facility is available to be borrowed in Euros or Australian dollars. Available liquidity is reduced by standby and trade letters of credit issued and outstanding under this facility. 
 (2) Borrowing availability under the ARS Facility is subject to a quarterly fluctuating facility limit ranging from 200 million in the first and second quarters to 225 million in the third and fourth quarters and permitted only to the extent that the face of the receivables in the collateral pool, net of applicable reserves and other deductions, exceeds the outstanding loans. 
 (3) Available liquidity for other international credit facilities is reduced for any outstanding international letters of credit. The international letters of credit are not outstanding under any specific credit facility and do not reduce actual borrowing capacity under the specific credit facilities. 
 The following have impacted or may impact our liquidity: 
 We have principal and interest obligations under our debt and ongoing financial covenants under those debt facilities. 
 We used a combination of cash generated from operations and net proceeds from the sale of the global Champion business, which was completed subsequent to our third quarter on September 30, 2024, to pay down 868 million of our outstanding term debt in October 2024. 
 The difficult global macroeconomic environment has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and the businesses of our customers. 
 Our Board of Directors eliminated our quarterly cash dividend as we shifted our capital allocation strategy in January 2023 to pay down debt to bring our leverage back to a range that is no greater than two to three times on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis. The declaration of any future dividends and, if declared, the amount of any such dividends, will be subject to our actual future earnings, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, debt covenants, other contractual restrictions and to the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 We have invested in global growth initiatives, as well as marketing and brand building. 
 We previously launched a series of multi-year cost savings programs and recently began implementing significant restructuring and consolidation efforts within our supply chain network, both manufacturing and distribution, as well as corporate cost and headcount reductions within continuing operations to drive stronger operating performance and margin expansion. 
 We expect capital expenditures of approximately 50 million in 2024, including capital expenditures of 40 million within investing cash flow activities and cloud computing arrangements of 10 million within operating cash flow activities. 
 In the future, when it aligns with our capital allocation strategy and absent any covenant restrictions, we may pursue strategic business acquisitions. 
 We have completed and may pursue strategic divestitures, such as the recently completed sales of our global Champion business on September 30, 2024 and the exit of our U.S.-based outlet store business in July 2024. 
 We made required cash contributions of 10 million to our U.S. pension plans in the nine months of 2024 based on the preliminary calculation by our actuary. We may also elect to make additional voluntary contributions. 
 We may increase or decrease the portion of the current-year income of our foreign subsidiaries that we remit to the United States, which could impact our effective income tax rate. We have not changed our reinvestment strategy from the prior year with regards to our unremitted foreign earnings and intend to remit foreign earnings totaling 802 million.

 Sources and Uses of Our Cash 
 The information presented below regarding the sources and uses of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was derived from our condensed consolidated interim financial statements. 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands) Operating activities 196,812 287,344 Investing activities (31,843) (15,377) Financing activities (40,161) (307,771) Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash (3,398) (11,518) Change in cash and cash equivalents 121,410 (47,322) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 205,501 238,413 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 326,911 191,091 Balances included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: Cash and cash equivalents 317,301 172,787 Cash and cash equivalents included in current assets held for sale 9,610 18,304 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 326,911 191,091 
 Operating Activities 
 Our overall liquidity has historically been driven by our cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on net operating results and changes in our working capital. Cash from operating activities decreased from prior year as we experienced significant reductions in working capital in the nine months of 2023. In the nine months of 2024, cash from operations was driven by margin expansion and continued discipline managing working capital. 
 Investing Activities 
 The increase in net cash used by investing activities in the nine months of 2024 compared to the nine months of 2023 was primarily the result of the final settlement of the cross currency swap contracts previously designated as net investment hedges in connection with the redemption of 3.5 Senior Notes, which resulted in a 19 million cash inflow in the nine months of 2023, and the exit of our U.S.-based outlet store business in July 2024 which resulted in a cash payment of 12 million in the nine months of 2024. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of 12 million in the nine months of 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used by financing activities of 40 million in the nine months of 2024 primarily resulted from net repayments on borrowings including total scheduled repayments on the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B of 30 million and net repayments on our ARS Facility. Net cash used by financing activities of 308 million in the nine months of 2023 primarily resulted from a combination of refinancing our debt structure and net repayments on borrowings of 276 million on our debt facilities and payments of 28 million to refinance our debt structure to provide greater near-term financial flexibility given the uncertainty within the macroeconomic environment, which included a required make-whole premium of 5 million and total capitalized debt issuance costs of 23 million. See Note Debt to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 In May 2024, we amended the ARS Facility. This amendment extended the maturity date to May 2025 with no change to the quarterly fluctuating facility limit, which was 225 million as of September 28, 2024. Additionally, the amendment removed the two pricing tiers that were added in the previous amendment, reverting back to a single tier pricing structure. See Note Debt to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 We believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our operations and key business strategies. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, among other financial and non-financial covenants, we are required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization, as computed pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility), or leverage ratio, each of which is defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The method of calculating all of the components used in the covenants is included in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 We expect to maintain compliance with our covenants, as amended, for at least 12 months from the issuance of these financial statements based on our current expectations and forecasts, however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 or other SEC filings could cause noncompliance. If economic conditions worsen or our earnings do not recover as currently estimated by management, this could impact our ability to maintain compliance with our amended financial covenants and require us to seek additional amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. If we are not able to obtain such necessary additional amendments, this would lead to an event of default and, if not cured timely, our lenders could require us to repay our outstanding debt. In that situation, we may not be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay the lenders. 
 For further details regarding our liquidity from our available cash balances and credit facilities see Cash Requirements and Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity above. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
 The application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. There have been no material changes in these policies from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 There have been no significant changes in our market risk exposures from those described in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 In connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that no changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are named in a putative class action in connection with the previously disclosed ransomware incident, entitled Toussaint et al. v. HanesBrands, [sic] Inc. This lawsuit was filed on April 27, 2023 and is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, and follows the consolidation of two previously pending lawsuits, entitled Roman v. Hanes Brands, [sic] Inc. , filed October 7, 2022, and Toussaint v. HanesBrands, [sic] Inc ., filed October 14, 2022. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, negligence, negligence per se, breach of implied contract, invasion of privacy, unjust enrichment, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unfair business practices under the California Business and Professions Code. The pending lawsuit seeks, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On April 2, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a class action settlement. If approved by the Court, the settlement generally provides for class members to claim reimbursement for documented out-of-pocket losses related to the ransomware incident (limited to an aggregate cap of 100,000), as well as a choice of one of the following three forms of additional relief (with no aggregate cap): (1) two years of credit and identity monitoring services; (2) a one-time use credit for purchase of products on the www.hanes.com website; or (3) a cash payment. We have also agreed to undertake certain injunctive relief, and to pay an agreed upon amount of attorneys fees, costs, and service awards to the plaintiffs, if approved by the Court. On November 5, 2024, the Court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement. The Court has scheduled the final approval hearing for March 10, 2025. We do not expect this settlement, if finally approved, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We currently anticipate the cost of the proposed settlement to be between 1 million and 2 million. 
 We are also subject to various claims and legal actions that occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. However, we are not party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors
