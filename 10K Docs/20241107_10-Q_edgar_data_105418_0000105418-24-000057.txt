 Two-Year Stacked Comparable Store Sales Analysis Management is providing Comparable Store Sales Two-Year Stacked analysis, a non-GAAP measure, because management believes this metric is useful to investors and analysts. A Comparable Store Sales Two-Year Stacked analysis presents a comparison of results and trends over a longer period of time to demonstrate the effect of fluctuating economic activity on the operating results of the Company. Information presented in the tables below is not intended for use as an alternative to any other measure of performance. It is not recommended that this table be considered a substitute for the Company s operating results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Year-over-year and sequential comparisons are the primary calculations used to analyze operating results, however, due to fluctuations caused by declining government benefits, pharmacy sales growth, and inflationary trends in the food retail industry, management believes it is necessary to provide a Two-Year Stacked Comparable Store Sales analysis. The following tables provide the two-year stacked comparable store sales, including and excluding fuel, for the periods ended September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023, as well as periods ended September 30, 2023, and September 24, 2022, respectively. Comparable store sales increased 2.5 percent on an individual year-over-year basis and increased 3.3 percent on a two-year stacked basis for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024. Comparable store sales increased 2.0 percent on an individual year-over-year basis and increased 4.5 percent on a two-year stacked basis in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024.

Relocated stores and stores with expanded square footage are included in comparable store sales since these units are located in existing markets and are open during construction. Planned store dispositions are excluded from the calculation. The Company only includes retail food stores in the calculation.

According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the Seasonally Adjusted Food-at-Home Consumer Price Index increased 0.7 and 0.5 for the thirteen week periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Seasonally Adjusted Food-at-Home Consumer Price Index increased 1.6 and 1.0 for thirty-nine week periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents WEIS MARKETS, INC. ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 
 Total net sales increased 2.2 to 1.2 billion for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, from 1.2 billion for the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. In the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, total net sales increased 1.8 to 3.5 billion from 3.5 billion. The increase in total net sales includes retail price inflation in grocery, pharmacy and fresh product categories. Comparable store sales for the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 increased 2.5 including fuel and 3.0 excluding fuel. Comparable store sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 increased 2.0 including fuel and 2.2 excluding fuel. Although the Company experienced retail inflation and deflation in various commodities for the periods presented, the Company anticipates overall product costs to increase given the recent inflationary indicators in the food retail industry. Management cannot accurately measure the full impact of inflation or deflation on retail pricing due to changes in the types of merchandise sold between periods, shifts in customer buying patterns and the fluctuation of competitive factors. Management remains confident in its ability to generate long-term sales growth in a highly competitive environment, but also understands some competitors have greater financial resources and could use these resources to take measures which could adversely affect the Company s competitive position. Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Cost of sales consists of direct product costs (net of discounts and allowances), net advertising costs, distribution center and transportation costs, as well as manufacturing facility operations. Gross profit on sales increased 1.9 and 0.7 for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. Gross profit margin decreased 0.1 and 0.3 for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Non-cash LIFO inventory valuation adjustments represent expense of 2.5 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024 compared to expense of 4.3 million in the same period in 2023. Although the Company experienced cost inflation and deflation in various commodities for the periods presented, the Company anticipates overall product costs to slightly increase given the recent inflationary trends in the food retail industry. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses The majority of the operating, general and administrative expenses are driven by sales volume. Employee expenses such as wages, employer paid taxes, health care benefits and retirement plans, comprise approximately 60.4 of the total Operating, general and administrative expenses. As a percent of sales, direct store labor increased 0.2 in each of the thirteen and thirty-nine week periods ended September 28, 2024 when compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense charged to Operating, general and administrative expenses was 25.8 million, or 2.2 of net sales during the thirteen weeks ended September 28, 2024 compared to 24.7 million, or 2.1 of net sales during the thirteen weeks ended September 30, 2023. During the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024 and 2023, depreciation and amortization expense charged to Operating, general and administrative expenses was 75.7 million, or 2.1 of net sales and 73.6 million, or 2.1 of net sales, respectively.

The effective income tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate, primarily due to the effect of state taxes, net of permanent differences. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary source of cash is cash flows generated from operations. In addition, the Company has access to a revolving credit agreement entered into on September 1, 2016, and last amended on September 29, 2023, with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement matures on October 1, 2027, and provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 30.0 million with an additional discretionary amount available of 70.0 million. As of September 28, 2024, the availability under the Credit Agreement was 13.2 million, net of 16.8 million letters of credit. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support performance, payment, deposit or surety obligations of the Company. The Company has not had an obligation on the Credit Agreement since the second quarter of 2018. The Company s investment portfolio consists of high-grade bonds and commercial paper with maturity dates between one and 30 years and four high yield, large capitalized public company equity securities. The portfolio totaled 231.4 million as of September 28, 2024. Management anticipates maintaining the investment portfolio but has the ability to liquidate if needed. The Company s capital expenditure program includes the construction of new superstores, the expansion and remodeling of existing units, the acquisition of sites for future expansion, new technology purchases and the continued upgrade of the Company s distribution facilities and transportation fleet. Management continues to invest in its long-term capital expenditure program including plans to complete multiple carryover projects from previous years that were delayed due to labor and supply chain disruptions.

 The Company anticipates funding the long-term capital expenditure program, the acquisition of retail stores, the construction of additional distribution facilities, repurchases of common stock, and cash dividends on common stock through its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash flows from operating activities, and the Credit Agreement. The Company has no other commitment of capital resources as of September 28, 2024, other than the lease commitments on its store facilities and transportation equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2038. The Board of Directors 2004 resolution authorizing the repurchase of up to one million shares of the Company s common stock has a remaining balance of 752,468 shares, and no repurchases were made during the quarter ended September 28, 2024. Quarterly Cash Dividends At its regular meeting held in October, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.34 per share, payable on November 26, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 12, 2024. The Company expects to continue paying regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, the Board of Directors reconsiders the declaration of dividends quarterly. The Company pays these dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors and the continuation of these payments and the amount of the dividends depends upon the results of operations, the financial condition of the Company and other factors which the Board of Directors deems relevant. Cash Flow Information 

39 Weeks Ended (amounts in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 2024 vs. 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 100,324 43,125 57,200 Investing activities (107,347) (109,394) 2,048 Financing activities (27,436) (27,436) Operating Cash flows from operating activities increased 57.2 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024 compared to the first thirty-nine weeks of 2023. The increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the one-time business practice used in late September 2023 to settle most outstanding working capital obligations in advance of the conversion to a new enterprise resource planning system in early October 2023 in order to mitigate any possible payment delays. Investing In the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, the purchase of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales, increased 26.3 million and the purchases of marketable securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, decreased 29.6 million. Additionally, as a percent of sales, capital expenditures were 3.0 in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024 and 2.2 in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2023. The increase as a percent of sales in 2024 compared to 2023 is due to the purchase of two previously leased store locations. For the remainder of 2024, management anticipates maintaining the investment portfolio but has the ability to liquidate if needed. Financing The Company paid dividends of 27.4 million in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2024 and 2023.
