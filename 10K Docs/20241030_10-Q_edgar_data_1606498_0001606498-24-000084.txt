 reporting unit. The fair value of our reporting unit is estimated using a combination of income (discounted cash flow analysis) and market approaches. The income approach is dependent upon several assumptions regarding future periods such as sales growth and a terminal growth rate. A weighted average cost of capital WACC was used to discount future estimated cash flows to their present values. The WACC was based on externally observable data considering market participants cost of equity and debt, optimal capital structure and risk factors specific to us. The market approach estimates the value of our company using a market capitalization methodology. 
 We determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the net carrying amount in our most recent goodwill impairment test on July 1, 2024. However, there can be no assurance that the assumptions and estimates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate. Volatility in the equity and debt markets, or increases in interest rates, could result in a higher discount rate. Changes in sales volumes, selling prices and costs of goods sold, and increases in interest rates could cause changes in our forecasted cash flows. Unfavorable changes in any of the factors described above, as well as a decline in our stock price, could result in a goodwill impairment charge in the future.

 The RH Divestiture represents a key component of Avanos ongoing transformation process, and is aimed at accelerating the Company s efforts to focus its portfolio on markets where it is well positioned to succeed. 
 At or before the closing of the RH Divestiture, we and Buyer entered into various transition services agreements pursuant to which we, Buyer and each company s respective affiliates provide to each other various transitional services, including, but not limited to, product manufacturing and distribution, facilities, order fulfillment, invoicing, quality assurance, regulatory support, audit support and other services. The services generally commenced on the closing date of the Divestiture and terminate no later than one to thereafter.

While our agreements with Buyer allows for limited risk distributor LRD arrangements for up to from the date of the Purchase Agreement, we expect the LRD arrangements to terminate by the end of this year. 
 As a result of the RH Divestiture, the results of operations from our RH business are reported as Net (Loss) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax and the related assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Pursuant to an agreement under which we provide manufacturing services for the Buyer, certain manufacturing facilities and equipment did not transfer to the Buyer upon the Initial Closing, and remained in Assets Held for Sale as of September 30, 2024 with a corresponding liability representing our obligation to transfer the manufacturing facilities and equipment to the buyer at a later date. Likewise, the results of operations from these manufacturing operations continue to be classified as Net Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. On October 1, 2024, we finalized the RH Divestiture and completed the transfer of the manufacturing facilities and equipment to Buyer. Accordingly, we expect to finalize adjustments to our pretax loss on discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2024.

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred million and million, respectively, of costs related to the Plan. These costs were included in Cost of products sold and Selling and general expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statements. 
 Transformation Process 
 In January 2023, we initiated a restructuring initiative intended to align the Company under a single commercial organization, rationalize our product portfolio, undertake additional cost management activities to enhance the Company s operating profitability and pursue efficient capital allocation strategies (the Transformation Process ). The RH Divestiture represents a key component of the Transformation Process. We expect the Transformation Process will be substantially complete by the end of 2025. 
 We expect to incur up to million of cash expenses in connection with the Transformation Process, consisting of between million and million of program management consulting and employee retention expenses; between million and million of expenses associated with manufacturing and supply chain improvements and portfolio rationalization; and the remainder for expenses associated with organization design and alignment and other related activities. These amounts include between million and million of employee severance and benefits costs. 
 In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred expenses of million and million, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and benefits costs in connection with the Transformation Process, compared to million and million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 million, consisting of million in cash paid upon entry into the definitive agreement and million in cash paid at closing (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments), with up to an additional million payable in contingent cash consideration based on achievement of certain performance objectives defined in the purchase agreement (the Diros Acquisition ). The purchase price for the Diros Acquisition was funded by proceeds from our Revolving Credit Facility. The accompanying condensed consolidated income statement includes million and million of net sales from Diros for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The accompanying condensed consolidated income statement includes million of net sales from Diros since the acquisition date for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred million and million of costs in connection with the Diros Acquisition, compared to million and million of costs in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These costs are included in Selling and general expenses, In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made contingent consideration payments of million and to date we have made contingent consideration payments of million. 
 Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid is allocated to the underlying net assets in proportion to their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values is recorded as goodwill. Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are being determined using discounted cash flow analyses and the fair value of the contingent consideration is being estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Assumptions supporting the estimated fair values are based on facts and circumstances that existed on the valuation date.

 On June 24, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with certain lenders which established credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of million, consisting of a senior secured term loan of million (the Term Loan Facility and a senior secured revolving credit facility allowing borrowings of up to million, with a letter of credit sub-facility in an amount of million (the Revolving Credit Facility ).

The unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to a commitment fee ranging between to per annum, depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio. Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Term Loan Facility using the interest method, resulting in an effective interest rate of as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Credit Agreement requires compliance with certain customary operational and financial covenants . As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain other customary limitations on our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on or repurchase or redeem our capital stock; make loans, investments and acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; guarantee other obligations; create or grant liens; and enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates. Notwithstanding such limitations, the Credit Agreement allows us to pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments up to an Available Amount, as defined in the Credit Agreement, provided no event of default has occurred and certain financial ratios have been achieved on a pro forma basis. We are permitted to prepay all or a portion of the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without premium or penalty. 
 Debt Payments 
 The Credit Agreement requires quarterly principal installment payments on the Term Loan Facility of of the total principal borrowed for the first eight quarters following funding and then quarterly installment payments of of the total principal borrowed, at which time the remaining unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan Facility is due and payable by the Company upon the maturity date of June 24, 2027. The current portion of the Term Loan Facility is million. Interest is payable quarterly. We have the right to voluntarily prepay the Term Loan Facility in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Interest is payable at the same rates set forth above for the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid million of the Term Loan Facility. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed million and repaid million of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of million.

 Patent Litigation 
 We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Competitors may claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property. Resolution of patent litigation or other intellectual property claims is typically time consuming and costly and can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of the affected products or require us to make significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products. 
 At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. 
 General 
 While we maintain general and professional liability, product liability and other insurance, our insurance policies may not cover all of these matters and may not fully cover liabilities arising out of these matters. In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify our directors and officers against these matters. 
 We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For any matters that are reasonably possible to result in loss and for which no possible loss or range of loss is disclosed in this Form 10-Q, management has determined that it is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss because, in each case, at least the following facts applied: (a) the matter is at an early stage of the proceedings; (b) the damages are indeterminate, unspecified or determined to be immaterial; and (c) significant factual issues have yet to be resolved. At present, although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 Environmental Compliance 
 We are subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations. We believe we are operating in compliance with, or are taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, these laws and regulations. None of our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Introduction 
 Avanos is a medical technology company focused on delivering clinically superior medical device solutions that help patients get back to the things that matter. We are committed to addressing some of today s most important healthcare needs, including providing a vital lifeline for nutrition to patients from hospital to home, and reducing the use of opioids while helping patients move from surgery to recovery. We develop, manufacture and market our recognized brands globally and hold leading market positions in multiple categories across our portfolio. 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1, Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Form 10-K. This MD A contains forward-looking statements. Refer to Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements at the beginning of this Form 10-Q for an explanation of these types of statements. 
 The following will be discussed and analyzed: 
 Restructuring Activities; 
 Divestiture of the Respiratory Health Business; 
 Discontinued Operations; 
 Business Acquisition; 
 Results of Operations and Related Information; 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources; and 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates. 
 Restructuring Activities 
 Post-RH Divestiture Restructuring Plan 
 During 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan (the Plan following the divestiture of our Respiratory Health RH business in the fourth quarter of 2023 (the RH Divestiture ). The Plan is intended to align our organizational structure and operational footprint with our remaining business. We expect the Plan will be substantially complete by the end of 2025 and currently expect to incur between 10.0 million to 11.0 million of cash expenses, primarily for employee termination benefits. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 2.3 million and 6.4 million, respectively, of costs related to the Plan. These costs were included in Selling and general expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated income statements. 
 Transformation Process 
 In January 2023, we initiated a three-year restructuring initiative pursuant to which we plan to: (i) combine our Chronic Care and Pain Management franchises into a single commercial organization focused on the Digestive Health and Pain Management Recovery product categories; (ii) rationalize our product portfolio including certain low-margin, low-growth product categories through targeted divestitures; (iii) undertake additional cost management activities to enhance the Company s operating profitability; and (iv) pursue efficient capital allocation strategies, including through acquisitions that meet the Company s strategic and financial criteria (the Transformation Process ). 
 By 2025, we expect total gross savings of between 45.0 million and 55.0 million compared to 2022, most of which will be achieved in 2024. We expect the Transformation Process will be substantially complete by the end of 2025. 
 We expect to incur up to 30.0 million of cash expenses in connection with the Transformation Process, consisting of between 9.0 million and 12.0 million of program management consulting and employee retention expenses, between 8.0 million and 11.0 million of expenses associated with manufacturing and supply chain improvements and portfolio rationalization; and the remainder for expenses associated with organization design and alignment and other related activities. These amounts include between 6.0 million and 8.0 million of employee severance and benefits costs. The accompanying condensed consolidated income statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include costs of 0.7 million and 5.2 million, respectively, incurred in connection with the Transformation Process in Selling and general expenses. 
 Divestiture 
 On October 2, 2023, we closed the sale of our RH business to SunMed Group Holdings, LLC Buyer for a total purchase price of 110 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement based on the indebtedness 
 23 

Table of Contents 

and inventory transferred to Buyer at the closing and the chargebacks assumed by Buyer but that would otherwise have been payable by the Company and its subsidiaries on or after October 2, 2023 to distributors of the Company s RH products located in the United States. 
 The RH Divestiture represents a key component of the Transformation Process, and is aimed at accelerating the Company s efforts to focus its portfolio on markets where it is well positioned to succeed. 
 In conjunction with the RH Divestiture, we and Buyer entered into various transition services agreements pursuant to which we, Buyer and each company s respective affiliates will provide to each other various transitional services, including, but not limited to, product manufacturing and distribution, facilities, order fulfillment, invoicing, quality assurance, regulatory support, audit support and other services. The services generally commenced on the closing date of the RH Divestiture and terminate no later than one to three years thereafter. 
 On October 1, 2024, we finalized the RH Divestiture and completed the transfer of certain manufacturing facilities and equipment that had not transferred to Buyer upon the Initial Closing. Accordingly, we expect to finalize adjustments to our pretax loss on discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 As a result of the RH Divestiture, the results of operations from our RH business are reported as (Loss) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax and the related assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Net sales from discontinued operations were 10.5 million and 41.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 31.1 million and 93.9 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Business Acquisition 
 On June 17, 2023 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Diros Technology Inc. Diros ), a leading manufacturer of innovative radiofrequency ablation RFA products used to treat chronic pain conditions. On July 24, 2023, we closed the acquisition of Diros for approximately 53.0 million, consisting of 2.5 million cash paid upon entry into the definitive agreement and 50.5 million in cash paid at closing (subject to certain working capital and other adjustments), with an additional 7.0 million payable in contingent cash consideration based on achievement of certain performance objectives defined in the purchase agreement (the Diros Acquisition ). The purchase price for the Diros Acquisition was funded by proceeds from our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 See Note 4, Business Acquisition in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details regarding the acquisition. 
 
 Results of Operations and Related Information 
 Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 In this section, we present Adjusted operating profit, which is a profitability measure that is not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP and is therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measure. We provide this non-GAAP measure because we use it to measure our operational performance and provide greater insight into our ongoing business operations. This measure is not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from, or an alternative to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided below under Adjusted operating profit.

 The items noted in the table above are described below: 
 Acquisition and integration-related charges : Acquisition and integration-related charges were 1.6 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and 4.1 million and 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were driven by the acquisition of Diros and expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were related to our acquisition of OrthogenRx, Inc. 
 Restructuring and transformation charges : In January 2023, we initiated the Transformation Process, a three-year restructuring initiative intended to align the Company under a single commercial organization, rationalize our product portfolio, undertake additional cost management activities to enhance the Company s operating profitability and pursue efficient capital allocation strategies. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we incurred 0.7 million and 5.2 million, respectively, of expenses related to the Transformation Process, primarily for employee severance and benefits costs. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we incurred 4.3 million and 23.0 million, respectively, of expenses related to the Transformation Process, which consisted of costs associated with program management consulting and employee retention expenses and employee severance and benefits costs. 
 Post-RH Divestiture transition charges : In conjunction with the divestiture of our RH business, we incurred professional services fees, equipment write-offs and incremental labor charges of approximately 0.7 million and 2.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Post-RH Divestiture restructuring charges: We initiated a post-RH Divestiture restructuring plan intended to align our organizational structure and operational footprint with our remaining business. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred expenses of 2.3 million and 6.4 million, respectively, related to the Plan, which primarily consisted of employee severance and benefits costs. 
 Divestiture-Related Charges : In conjunction with the divestiture of our RH business, we incurred accounting, legal and other professional fees of approximately 1.4 million and 5.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 EU MDR Compliance : The European Union Medical Device Regulation (the EU MDR brings significant new requirements for our medical devices sold in the European Union. Incremental costs associated with EU MDR compliance are primarily 
 27 

Table of Contents 

related to re-certification of our products under the enhanced standards. We incurred 1.6 million and 4.4 million of costs for EU MDR compliance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.8 million and 2.8 million of costs for EU MDR compliance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In early 2023, the deadlines for compliance were extended after compliance was proceeding slower than expected by the European Commission due to a number of factors including insufficient capacity for timely issuance of device certifications under the new requirements. We expect the activities associated with EU MDR compliance will be substantially complete by the end of 2025. 
 Litigation and legal : We incurred no costs for litigation matters in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we accrued 8.5 million for litigation matters. This expense was for a settlement related to a customer claim and is included in Other expense, net . 
 Intangibles amortization : Intangibles amortization is related primarily to intangibles acquired in business acquisitions and was 6.4 million and 18.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 6.2 million and 17.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest accrued and amortization of debt issuance costs on our revolving credit facility net of interest capitalized on long-term capital projects. See Note 7, Debt in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Interest expense was 3.2 million and 9.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.7 million and 11.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our outstanding debt balances, net of unamortized discounts, were 162.0 million and 168.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Income Taxes 
 The income tax provision was 3.6 million and 6.5 million, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax provision of 6.2 million and 4.1 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 37.9 and 37.8 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was (238.5) and (24.4) , respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand provided by operating activities and amounts available with our Revolving Credit Facility under our Credit Agreement. We expect our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund capital expenditures in the next twelve months. In addition, with our borrowing capacity, we expect to have the ability to fund capital expenditures and other investments necessary to grow our business for the foreseeable future for both our domestic and international operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 43.0 million of our 89.0 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested overseas and currently do not have plans to repatriate such earnings. We do not expect restrictions on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased by 1.3 million to 89.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 87.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 42.8 million of cash provided by operations and 20.0 million in proceeds from our revolving credit facility. This was partially offset by 13.0 million of capital expenditures, a 9.0 million investment in a note receivable, payments of 6.3 million on our term loan, payments of 20.0 million on our revolving credit facility and 12.7 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock. 
 In the prior year, cash and cash equivalents decreased by 20.6 million to 107.1 million as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by 47.5 million used to purchase Diros, 11.9 million of capital expenditures, payments of 20.0 million on our revolving credit facility and 12.9 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock. This was partially offset by 19.7 million of cash generated from operating activities and 55.0 million in proceeds from our revolving credit facility. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 On June 24, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with certain lenders which established credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of 500.0 million, consisting of a five-year senior secured term loan of 125.0 million (the Term Loan Facility and a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility allowing borrowings of up to 375.0 million, with a letter of credit sub-facility in an amount of 75.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ). All obligations under the Credit Agreement and certain hedging agreements and cash management arrangements thereunder are: (i) guaranteed by 
 28 

Table of Contents 

each of the Company s direct and indirect, existing and future, material wholly owned domestic subsidiaries Guarantors and (ii) secured by a first priority lien on substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. The Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that allows us to incur incremental term loans under the Term Loan Facility or under new term loan facilities or to increase the amount of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, including through the establishment of one or more tranches under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement will mature on June 24, 2027. 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at our option at either: (i) an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus a margin ranging between 1.50 to 2.00 per annum, depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio; (ii) an adjusted daily simple SOFR rate, plus a margin ranging between 1.50 to 2.00 per annum, depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio; or (iii) a base rate (calculated as the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the NYFRB rate (being the greater of the federal funds effective rate or the overnight bank funding rate) plus 0.50 , and (c) the one month adjusted term SOFR rate plus 1.00 ), plus a margin ranging between 0.50 to 1.00 per annum, depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio. The unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility will be subject to a commitment fee ranging between 0.20 to 0.25 per annum, depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio. 
 The Credit Agreement requires compliance with certain customary operational and financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain other customary limitations on our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on or repurchase or redeem our capital stock; make loans, investments and acquisitions; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; guarantee other obligations; create or grant liens; and enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates. Notwithstanding such limitations, the Credit Agreement allows us to pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments up to an Available Amount, as defined in the Credit Agreement, provided no event of default has occurred and certain financial ratios have been achieved on a pro forma basis. 
 See Note 7, Debt in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for further details regarding our debt agreements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. See Note 1, Accounting Policies in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the Form 10-K, which describes our most significant accounting policies. In addition, our critical accounting policies and estimates are presented under the caption Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the Form 10-K. Certain of these policies require management to make estimates or assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Management views these policies as critical accounting policies. See Note 1, Accounting Policies in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for updates to our critical accounting policies and a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation in the Form 10-K.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections, audits or investigations pertaining to issues such as contract disputes, product liability, tax matters, patents and trademarks, advertising, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. At present, although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the Form 10-K, except as follows: 
 We are subject to political, economic and regulatory risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. 
 Most of our manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States in Mexico. In addition, we use contract manufacturers outside the United States from time to time and source many of our raw materials and components from foreign suppliers, including suppliers in China and Mexico. We distribute and sell our products globally. In 2023, approximately 20 of our net sales were generated outside of North America and we expect this percentage will grow over time. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with both United States and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include robust data privacy requirements, labor relations laws that may impede employer flexibility, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import, customs and trade restrictions, export requirements, economic sanction laws, environmental, health and safety laws, anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be violated inadvertently or through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. In addition, these laws are subject to changes, which may require additional resources or make it more difficult for us to comply with these laws. Violations of the laws and regulations governing our international operations could result in fines or criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in one or more countries and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and prevent or mitigate these risks and manage difficulties as they arise. 
 We are subject to tariffs and taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and we may be subject to trade protection measures that are being contemplated or implemented by the United States and other governments around the world, as well as potential disruptions in trade agreements, such as the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU. For example, during 2024 the United States announced increased tariffs on a Chinese-sourced component of certain of our products. While we have received an extension on the effectiveness of such tariffs, we are exploring options to identify a longer-term solution to such tariffs (although there can be no assurance that we will succeed in such efforts). In addition, changes in the United States government following the 2024 presidential and congressional elections may result in changes to United States trade policies and tariffs, and may cause other countries to react to such changes. 
 These developments, measures and disruptions may result in new or higher tariffs, import-export restrictions and taxes. Changes in, or revised interpretations of import-export laws or international trade agreements, along with new or increased tariffs, trade restrictions or taxation on income earned or goods manufactured outside the United States may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including: 
 different local medical practices, product preferences and product requirements, 
 price and currency controls and exchange rate fluctuations, 
 cost and availability of international shipping channels, 
 longer payment cycles in certain countries other than the United States, 
 minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in certain countries, 
 30

uncertainties regarding judicial systems, including difficulties in enforcing agreements through certain non-U.S. legal systems, 
 political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, expropriation of assets, economic instability and the impact on interest rates, inflation and the credit worthiness of our customers, and 
 difficulties and costs of staffing and managing non-U.S. operations 
 These risks and difficulties, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

 Not applicable 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 Not applicable 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

10. Certain Reduction of Payments by the Corporation . 
 
 (a) Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event a reputable certified public accounting firm designated by the Corporation (the Accounting Firm shall determine that receipt of all Payments would subject a Participant to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a Reduced Amount . If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount. The reduction of the Payments, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing cash Payments and then, to the extent necessary, reducing those Payments having the next highest ratio of Parachute Value to actual present value of such Payments as of the date of the Change of Control, as determined by the Accounting Firm. For purposes of this Section 11, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code, and the Parachute Value of a Payment means the present value as of the date of the change of control of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a parachute payment under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment. All fees payable to the Accounting Firm with respect to this Section 11 shall be paid solely by the Corporation. 
 
 (b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Separation Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Corporation shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 11 shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Participant and shall be made as promptly as practicable. Following such determination, the Corporation shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Participant such Separation Payments as are then due to the Participant under Section 5 of this Plan and shall promptly pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Participant in the future such Separation Payments as become due to the Participant under this Plan. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be made within 60 days of the later of the Qualified Termination of Employment of the Participant or the date of the Change of Control. 
 
 (c) While it is the intention of the Corporation to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant hereunder only if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts to the Participant would thereby be increased, as a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so paid or distributed Overpayment or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Corporation to or for the benefit of a Participant pursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Overpayment has been made, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Corporation or the Participant which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, the Participant shall repay any such benefit to the Corporation together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code provided, however, that no such interest 
 -9 - 

shall be deemed to have been incurred and no amount shall be payable by a Participant to the Corporation if and to the extent such repayment would not either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Corporation to or for the benefit of the Participant together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code, but no later than March 15 of the year after the year in which the Underpayment is determined to exist, which is when the legally binding right to such Underpayment arises. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the payment will be conditioned upon the Overpayment or Underpayment meeting the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 
 11. No Duty to Mitigate . In no event shall any Participant be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Participant under any of the provisions of this Plan, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Participant obtains other employment. 
 
 12. Termination and Amendment of this Plan . The Committee shall have the power at any time, in its discretion, to amend, abandon or terminate this Plan, in whole or in part, except that no such amendment, abandonment or termination shall adversely affect the rights of, or the benefits payable to, any Participant under the Plan unless such amendment, abandonment or termination is agreed to in a writing signed by the Participant and the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may modify the Plan at any time without the Participants' consent to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any other rule, regulation, or statute, as determined by the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion. 
 
 13. Successors . The Corporation shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of its business and or assets to assume expressly and agree to perform this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform them if no such succession had taken place. 
 
 14. Interpretation of the Plan . The Committee shall have sole and absolute authority to interpret and construe the terms of this Plan. Any interpretations, rules, decisions, or constructions by the Committee shall be final and binding on all Participants. 
 
 15. Tax Treatment . The Participant shall be solely responsible for tax consequences of any payment under the Plan. It is intended that the payments and benefits provided under the Plan shall either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Plan shall be construed in a manner that effects such intent. Nevertheless, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Corporation nor its respective directors, officers, employees or advisers (other than in his or her capacity as a Participant) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan. 
 
 -10 - 

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent that any amount or benefit that would constitute non-exempt deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation would otherwise be payable or distributable under the Plan by reason of the occurrence of the Participant s termination of employment, such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation will not be payable or distributable to the Participant by reason of such circumstance unless the circumstances giving rise to such termination of employment meet any description or definition of separation from service in Section 409A of the Code and applicable regulations (without giving effect to any elective provisions that may be available under such definition). If this provision prevents the payment or distribution of any Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation, such payment or distribution shall be made on the date, if any, on which an event occurs that constitutes a Section 409A-compliant separation from service. Each payment of Severance Benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be considered a separate payment, as described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(b)(2), for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. 
 
 Whenever in this Plan a payment or benefit is conditioned on the Participant s execution of a Separation Agreement, the Separation Agreement must be executed and all revocation periods shall have expired in accordance with terms set forth therein, but in no case later than sixty (60) days after the date of the Qualified Termination of Employment failing which such payment or benefit shall be forfeited. If such payment or benefit constitutes Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation, then such payment or benefit (including any installment payments) that would have otherwise been payable during such 60-day period shall be accumulated and paid on the 60th day after the date of the Qualified Termination of Employment provided such release shall have been executed and such revocation periods shall have expired. If such payment or benefit is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, the Corporation may elect to make or commence payment at any time during such 60-day period. 
 
 17. Indemnification . If litigation shall be brought by a Participant to enforce any provision contained in this Plan and at least one claim in such litigation is adjudicated in the Participant s favor, the Corporation hereby agrees to indemnify the Participant for the Participant s reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements incurred in such litigation, and hereby agrees to pay prejudgment interest on any money judgment obtained by the Participant calculated at Citibank's (or any successor entity) prime rate of interest in effect from time to time from the date that payment(s) to the Participant should have been made under this Plan. The reimbursement of an attorney's fees and disbursements incurred in such litigation will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred. 
 
 18. Payment Obligations Absolute . The Corporation's obligation to pay a Participant the Severance Benefits provided in this Plan shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Corporation may have against the Participant or anyone else. All amounts payable by the Corporation hereunder shall be paid without notice or demand. 
 
 19. Effective Date . This Plan became effective on November 1, 2014, was amended and restated on October 26, 2016, and was further amended and restated on October 25, 2017, October 27, 2020, March 4, 2022, February 14, 2023 and October 29, 2024.
