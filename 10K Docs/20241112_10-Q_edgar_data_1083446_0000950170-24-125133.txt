The acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The fair value of the consideration for the acquired companies was allocated to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Factors leading to goodwill being recognized are the Company s expectation of synergies from combining operations of entities acquired and the Company, as well as the value of intangible assets that are not separately recognized, such as assembled workforce. The determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires the Company to make estimates and use valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. Transaction costs associated with business acquisitions are expensed as they are incurred. At the time of acquisition, the Company estimates the amount of the identifiable intangible assets based on a valuation and the facts and circumstances available at the time. The Company determines the final value of the identifiable intangible assets as soon as information is available, but not more than one year from the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company had impair ment of its goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The resolution of any claim or litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Liability Insurance The Company believes that its insurance coverage is appropriate based upon the Company s claims experience and the nature and risks of the Company s business. In addition to the known incidents that have resulted in the assertion of claims, the Company cannot be certain that its insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against the Company, the Company s affiliated professional organizations or the Company s affiliated hospitalists in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of all pending claims, including liabilities in excess of the Company s insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows; however, there can be no assurance that future claims will not have such a material adverse effect on the Company s business. Contracted physicians are required to obtain their own insurance coverage. Although the Company currently maintains liability insurance policies on a claims-made basis which are intended to cover malpractice liability and certain other claims, the coverage must be renewed annually and may not continue to be available to the Company in future years at acceptable costs and on favorable terms.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin, of which the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP is net income. These measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives to, GAAP, and may be calculated differently from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, excluding income or loss from equity method investments, non-recurring and non-cash transactions, stock-based compensation, and APC excluded assets costs. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA over total revenue. 
 The Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with relevant and useful information, as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of the business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of non-core or non-recurring financial information. When GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company s ongoing operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among those indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating operational performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. To the extent this Form 10-Q contains historical or future non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided corresponding GAAP financial measures for comparative purposes. The reconciliation between certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided above. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and investment in marketable securities at September 30, 2024 totaled 350.3 million as compared to 296.3 million at December 31, 2023. Working capital totaled 284.1 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to 242.8 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of 41.2 million. 
 We have historically financed our operations primarily through internally generated funds. We generate cash primarily from capitation contracts, risk pool settlements and incentives, fees for medical management services provided to our affiliated physician groups, and FFS reimbursements. We generally invest cash in money market accounts and certificates of deposit, which are classified as cash and cash equivalents. We also have the Amended Credit Agreement, which provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of 400.0 million and a term loan of up to 300.0 million and expires June 2026 and November 2028, respectively. In addition, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and other securities that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 63.1 million, as compared to cash provided by operating activities of 48.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by adjusted net income and changes in working capital. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt issuance cost, share-based compensation, non-cash lease expense, gain on debt extinguishment, unrealized gains or losses, income from equity method investments, deferred tax and other was 97.2 million compared to 88.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased operating cash flow by 34.1 million, compared to a 40.0 million decrease in operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly driven by an increase from receivables, net, including amounts with related parties, primarily due to timing of our receivables, including risk pool settlements that occur approximately 18 months after the risk pool performance year is completed, a decrease from prepaid expenses and other current assets, a decrease from income taxes payable as a result of timing of income tax payments, and increases from accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical liabilities due to timing of payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 159.1 million, due to payments for business and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired of 115.5 million, issuances of loans of 26.0 million, purchase of an equity method investment of 6.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of 5.5 million, purchase of a call option issued in conjunction with an equity method investment of 3.9 million, purchase of a privately held investment of 2.5 million, and purchases of marketable securities of 0.1 million. The cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from repayment of loans of 0.3 million and proceeds from sale of marketable securities of 0.1 million. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 54.1 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of 21.5 million, purchases of marketable securities of 2.1 million, purchase of a privately held investment of 2.0 million, purchase of an equity method investment of 0.3 million, contribution to an equity method investment of 0.7 million, issuance of a loan receivable of 25.0 million, and payments for business and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired of 4.7 million. The cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from repayment of a loan receivable of 2.2 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 150.4 million, primarily due to borrowings on long-term debt totaling 171.9 million, proceeds from ESPP purchases of 0.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 0.2 million, and proceeds from the sale of non-controlling interest of 0.2 million. This was partially offset by repayments of debt of 14.8 million, tax payments from net share settlement of restricted stock awards and units of 4.0 million, dividend payments of 2.1 million, repurchase of treasury shares of 0.7 million, and repayment of finance lease obligations of 0.5 million. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 8.6 million, primarily due to the repurchase of treasury stock of 9.7 million, dividend payments of 2.3 million, repayment of debt of 0.5 million, a repayment of finance lease obligations of 0.5 million, and purchase of non-controlling interest of 0.1 million. This was partially offset by borrowings from bank loans totaling 3.1 million and proceeds from the exercise of options of 1.3 million.

Amended Credit Agreement 
 The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility to the Company of 400.0 million, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility of up to 50.0 million and a swingline loan sub-facility of 25.0 million, which expires on June 16, 2026. On November 3, 2023, the Company entered into the third amendment to the Amended Credit Agreement, which provided a new term loan to the Company in an aggregate amount of up to 300.0 million. This increased the Company s facility under the Amended Credit Agreement to 700.0 million, including the existing 400.0 million revolver. Refer to Note 9 Credit Facility, Promissory Notes Payable, Bank Loans, and Lines of Credit to our condensed consolidated financial statements under Item 1 in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Commitment Letter 
 To provide additional financial flexibility for the Company, in connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a commitment letter (the Commitment Letter ), dated as of November 8, 2024, with the Banks and the other affiliates of the Banks party thereto, pursuant to which the Banks committed to provide (i) the Bridge Facility, a 364-day senior secured bridge term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to 1,095.0 million, and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 100.0 million. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the Bridge Facility, together with cash on hand, to fund the Transaction, to refinance the Company s existing credit facilities and to pay for fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing. The funding of the Bridge Facility provided for in the Commitment Letter is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including but not limited to (i) the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Bridge Facility in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter, and (ii) the consummation of the Transaction in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Amounts funded under the Bridge Facility, if any, will be reduced by the aggregate amount of gross proceeds that the Company elects to raise in a long-term debt and/or equity financing transaction on or prior to the closing of the Transaction as further set forth in the Commitment Letter. 
 61 

Promissory Note Payable 
 On April 1, 2024, the Company received 8.3 million as a promissory note with a maturity date of March 31, 2027. I Health may accelerate the maturity date if the Company does not exercise the I Health Call Options. On July 1, 2024, an amendment was made to the I Health Promissory Note that, among other things, increased the original principal amount by an additional 1.6 million. As a result, the total amount payable under the I Health Promissory Note is 9.9 million. Refer to Note 9 Credit Facility, Promissory Notes Payable, Bank Loans, and Lines of Credit to our condensed consolidated financial statements under Item 1 in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts of revenue, expenses, income, assets and liabilities reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those judgments, assumptions, and estimates. In addition, judgments, assumptions, and estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which our management uses judgment, assumptions, and estimates in applying these policies, therefore, is integral to understanding our financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties, potentially resulting in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We summarize our most significant accounting policies in relation to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies thereto. Please also refer to the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that are, or have been, reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Borrowings under the Term Loan provided for under our Amended Credit Agreement, as of September 30, 2024, were 285.3 million. The Term Loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to either, at the Company s option, (a) the Term SOFR Reference Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), adjusted for any Term SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), plus a spread from 1.50 to 2.75 , as determined on a quarterly basis based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), or (b) a base rate, plus a spread of 0.50 to 1.75 , as determined on a quarterly basis based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had borrowed 146.7 million under the Revolver Loan. The Revolver Loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to either, at the Company s option, (a) the Term SOFR Reference Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), adjusted for any Term SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus a spread ranging from 1.25 to 2.50 , as determined on a quarterly basis based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), or (b) a base rate, plus a spread ranging from 0.25 to 1.50 , as determined on a quarterly basis based on the Company s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio. Borrowings under the Promissory Note Payable with I Health, as of September 30, 2024, was 9.9 million. The promissory note has an interest rate of 4.30 per annum on the principal amount. The Company has entered into a collar agreement for its Revolver Loan to effectively convert its floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. The principal objective of the collar agreement is to eliminate or reduce the variability of the cash flows in interest payments associated with the Company s floating-rate debt, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest payment cash flows. A hypothetical 1 change in our interest rates for our outstanding borrowings would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, by 4.4 million. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS A ND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Operating Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Operating Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 63 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are, from time to time, party to lawsuits, threatened lawsuits, disputes, and other claims arising in the normal course of business. We assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal accruals may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we do not record an accrual, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. In the opinion of management, while the outcome of such claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, our ultimate liability in connection with these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, and the amounts accrued for any individual matter are not material. However, legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period. 
 Certain of the pending or threatened legal proceedings or claims in which we are involved are discussed under Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which disclosure is incorporated by reference herein. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK F ACTORS 
 Our business, financial condition, and operating results are affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including risks specific to us or the healthcare industry, as well as risks that affect businesses in general. In addition to the information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. The risks disclosed in such Annual Report could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, and thus our stock price. We believe there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in the Annual Report, other than those set forth below. However, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or which we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Because of such risk factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition, the disclosure of any risk factor should not be interpreted to imply that the risk has not already materialized. 
 The Transaction is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, and the Transaction may not be completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Transaction in a timely manner or at all could have adverse effects on the Company. 
 There can be no assurance that the proposed Transaction will occur in a timely manner, or at all. The completion of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, receipt of applicable regulatory and governmental approvals, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Transaction uncertain. Also, either party may terminate the Purchase Agreement if the Transaction has not been consummated by August 8, 2025 (provided, that if certain required regulatory approvals have not been met by such date, then the Sellers may extend such date for up to an additional three months), except that this right to terminate the Purchase Agreement is not available to any party that has materially breached any provision of the Purchase Agreement, where such breach has resulted in the failure of certain conditions to closing the Purchase Agreement to be satisfied. 
 64 

If the Transaction is not completed, our ongoing business, financial condition, financial results, and stock price may be materially adversely affected. Without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Transaction, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Transaction will be completed; 

if the Purchase Agreement is terminated and we seek another acquisition, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms of the Purchase Agreement; 

time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Transaction could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for the Company; 

we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers, suppliers or employees; 

we will be required to pay our costs relating to the Transaction, such as legal, accounting, and financial advisory fees, whether or not the Transaction is completed; and 

litigation related to any failure to complete the Transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. 

The materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact our ongoing business, financial condition, financial results, and stock price. Similarly, delays in the completion of the Transaction could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue, or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Transaction. 
 Financing the Transaction will result in an increase in our indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense. 
 To provide additional financial flexibility for the Company, in connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into the Commitment Letter, pursuant to which the Banks committed to provide (i) the Bridge Facility, a 364-day senior secured bridge term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to 1,095.0 million, and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 100.0 million. The Company intends to use the proceeds of the Bridge Facility, together with cash on hand, to fund the Transaction, to refinance the Company s existing credit facilities and to pay for fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing. The funding of the Bridge Facility provided for in the Commitment Letter is contingent on the satisfaction of customary conditions, including but not limited to (i) the execution and delivery of definitive documentation with respect to the Bridge Facility in accordance with the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter, and (ii) the consummation of the Transaction in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Amounts funded under the Bridge Facility, if any, will be reduced by the aggregate amount of gross proceeds that the Company elects to raise in a long-term debt and/or equity financing transaction on or prior to the closing of the Transaction as further set forth in the Commitment Letter. 
 This increase in our indebtedness may, among other things, reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs. In addition, the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will materially increase as a result of the indebtedness to finance the Transaction. 
 We may not achieve the intended benefits of the Transaction, and the Transaction may disrupt our current plans or operations. 
 There can be no assurance that, following completion of the Transaction, we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired operations or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the Transaction (including operating and other cost synergies). Difficulties in integrating the acquired operations into the Company may result in the Company performing differently than expected, in 
 65 

operational challenges, or in the failure to realize anticipated run-rate cost synergies and efficiencies in the expected timeframe or at all, in which case the anticipated benefits of the Transaction may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. Further, it is possible that there could be a loss of our and/or the Sellers key employees, disruption of our or the Sellers ongoing business or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post-completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The integration of the acquired operations may result in material challenges, including the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining key management and other employees; retaining or attracting business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process and associated expenses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and potential unknown liabilities, unforeseen expenses relating to integration, or delays associated with the Transaction. 
 66 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE S OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 In December 2022, Astrana s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 50.0 million of its shares of common stock on the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. This share repurchase plan does not have an expiration date. The Board may suspend or discontinue the repurchase plan at any time. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to make additional repurchases at any specific time or in any specific situation. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no shares were repurchased under the Company s share repurchase plan. As of September 30, 2024, 40.5 million remained available for repurchase under the repurchase plan.

 1.2 	 Incorporation of Terms of Plan . The Restricted Shares are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. 
 2.	Grant. 
 	2.1 	 Grant of Restricted Shares . In consideration of Participant s Continuous Service and for other good and valuable consideration, effective as of the Grant Date set forth in the Grant Notice (the Grant Date ), the Company grants to Participant the Restricted Shares, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement, subject to adjustments as provided in Article VIII of the Plan. 
 2.2 	 Consideration to the Company . In consideration of the grant of the Restricted Shares by the Company, Participant agrees to render faithful and efficient services to the Company or a Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer upon Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Company or a Subsidiary and Participant. 
 3.	Vesting, Delivery, Restrictions, Etc. 
 	3.1 	 Vesting . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Restricted Shares shall vest at such times as are set forth in the Grant Notice; provided, however, none of the Restricted Shares that have not become vested at the date of Participant s termination of Continuous Service for any reason, with or without cause (including, but not limited to, death, Disability or Retirement), shall thereafter become vested, except as may be otherwise provided by the Committee or as set forth in a written agreement between the Company and Participant. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control, the treatment of the Restricted Shares will be governed by any applicable provisions of Section 21 of the Plan. 
 	3.2	 Restrictions . Unless and until the Restricted Shares vest as set forth in the Grant Notice, Participant shall have no right to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber the Restricted Shares in any manner. Any purported attempt to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber any Restricted Shares under this Agreement shall be void and shall result in the forfeiture and cancellation of such Restricted Shares. Upon Participant s termination of 
 1 

employment or service for any reason, with or without cause (including, but not limited to, death, Disability or Retirement), any Restricted Shares that are unvested as of the date of such termination of employment or service (and whose vesting is not accelerated pursuant to this Agreement or the Plan) shall be forfeited, and Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Restricted Shares under this Agreement or otherwise.

Subject to Section 3.4 below, the vesting of the Restricted Shares under this Agreement will result in Participant s recognition of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The parties agree that to the extent the Company or any Subsidiary is required to withhold any federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes in connection with the vesting or the grant of the Restricted Shares, then such tax withholding shall be satisfied by the forfeiture of a number of Restricted Shares having a value equal to the required tax withholding (based on the Fair Market Value per Share on the applicable date), provided that in no event shall the value of the Shares retained exceed maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent authorized by the Committee, the Participant may be permitted to elect, in accordance with procedures adopted by the Company from time to time, to pay or provide for payment of any required tax withholding. 
 3.4 	 Section 83(b) Election . If Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to the Restricted Shares as of the date of transfer of the Restricted Shares rather than as of the date or dates upon which Participant would otherwise be taxable under Section 83 of the Code, Participant shall be required to deliver a copy of such election to the Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service. 
 3.5 	 Rights as Stockholder . Upon issuance of the Restricted Shares and until the forfeiture or cancellation of the Restricted Shares, Participant shall have, unless otherwise provided by the Committee, all the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Shares, subject to the transferability and other restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect to the Restricted Shares; provided, however, that any extraordinary distributions with respect to the Company s common stock received by Participant in the form of shares of such common stock shall be subject to the same vesting and other restrictions as the Restricted Shares to which they relate.

any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan, this Agreement or the Restricted Shares.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company s common stock contemplated by the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such Shares), the Committee shall make such adjustments as the Committee deems appropriate to the Restricted Shares in order to preserve the benefits intended to be made available to Participant under this Agreement. Participant acknowledges that the Restricted Shares are subject to adjustment, modification and termination in certain events as provided in this Agreement and the Plan. 
 4.3 	 Notices .
