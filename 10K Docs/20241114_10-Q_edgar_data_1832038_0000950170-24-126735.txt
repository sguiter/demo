shares of its common stock under the Sales Agreement at an average price of per share for million in net proceeds. After receiving EUA in March 2024, the Company has also funded its operations from sales of PEMGARDA. The Company has incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception, including a net loss of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company may continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. Based on current operating plans and excluding any contribution from future revenues or external financing, the Company will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements beyond one year from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, and therefore, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will require additional funding through a combination of contribution from revenues, equity offerings, government or private-party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, such as collaborations with other companies, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements to finance its future operations. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or rights of the Company s stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital, the Company will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Basis of Presentation The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC and Accounting Standards Update ASU of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Invivyd, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Invivyd Security Corporation, Invivyd Switzerland GmbH, and Invivyd Netherlands B.V. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one operating segment, which is the business of discovering, developing and commercializing differentiated products for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

billion or it issues more than billion of non-convertible debt in the previous three-year period, it will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. For so long as the Company remains an emerging growth company, it is permitted and intends to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. For example, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. The amendments also require companies with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by this amendment and all existing segment disclosures in ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impacts of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statement disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to enhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures, particularly in the rate reconciliation table and disclosures about income taxes paid. The amendments are intended to address investors requests for income tax disclosures that provide more information to help them better understand an entity s exposure to potential changes in tax laws and the ensuing risks and opportunities and to assess income tax information that affects cash flow forecasts and capital allocation decisions. The guidance also eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. The guidance is effective for the Company for the annual period beginning after December 15, 2024. All entities should apply the guidance prospectively but have the option to apply it retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impacts of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.

t recognize any research and development expense with respect to services performed by Adimab on the Company s behalf under the Adimab Assignment Agreement. Please refer to Note 15 for additional information. The Company is obligated to pay Adimab up to million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the first Product under the agreement that achieves such specified milestones and up to million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second Product under the agreement that achieves such specified milestones. The maximum aggregate amount of milestone payments payable under the agreement for any and all Products is million , of which a total of million has been achieved and paid as of September 30, 2024; however, milestone payments do not accrue for certain in vitro diagnostic devices consisting of or containing CoV Antibodies. In March 2023, the Company achieved the first specified milestone for the second product candidate under the Adimab Assignment Agreement upon dosing of the first subject in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VYD222, which obligated the Company to make a million milestone payment to Adimab, which was paid in May 2023. In September 2023, the Company achieved specified milestones for the second product candidate under the Adimab Assignment Agreement upon dosing of the first subject in a pivotal clinical trial evaluating VYD222, which obligated the Company to make a million milestone payment to Adimab, which was paid in October 2023. The next potential milestone under the Adimab Assignment Agreement is a low single-digit million-dollar regulatory milestone, which was not considered probable under U.S. GAAP and therefore, no expense was recognized as of September 30, 2024. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t recognize any in-process research and development IPR D expense with respect to contingent consideration payable under the Adimab Assignment Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized and million, respectively, of IPR D expense 

 12 

million incurred through December 31, 2023, no other milestone payments have been paid to or have been earned by Adimab through September 30, 2024. The Company is obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a mid-single-digit percentage based on net sales of any Products, beginning upon the first commercial sale of a Product in accordance with the Adimab Assignment Agreement. The royalty rate is subject to reductions specified under the agreement. Royalties are due on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis beginning upon the first commercial sale of each Product and ending on the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such Product in such country and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent covering such Product in such country (the Royalty Term ). During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company expensed million of royalties and reserves all rights under the Adimab Assignment Agreement and the applicable law. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company did t expense any royalties. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a specified percentage in the range of to of any compulsory sublicense consideration received by the Company in lieu of certain royalty payments. Unless earlier terminated, the Adimab Assignment Agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire Royalty Term for any and all Products. The Company may terminate the agreement at any time for any or no reason upon advance written notice to Adimab, or in the event of a material breach by Adimab that is not cured with specific periods. Adimab may only terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the Company for its due diligence obligation or a payment obligation. Upon any termination of the agreement prior to its expiration, all licenses and rights granted pursuant to the arrangement will automatically terminate and revert to the granting party and all other rights and obligations of the parties will terminate. The Company concluded that the Adimab Assignment Agreement represented an asset acquisition of IPR D assets with no alternative future use. The arrangement did not qualify as a business combination because substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired was concentrated in a single asset. Adimab Collaboration Agreement In May 2021, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Adimab, as amended in November 2022 and September 2023 (the Adimab Collaboration Agreement ), for the discovery and optimization of proprietary antibodies as potential therapeutic product candidates. Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Adimab could collaborate on research programs for a specified number of targets selected by the Company within a specified time period. Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, Adimab granted the Company a worldwide, non-exclusive license to certain of its platform patents and technology and antibody patents to perform the Company s responsibilities during the ongoing research period and for a specified evaluation period thereafter (the Evaluation Term ). In addition, the Company granted Adimab a license to certain of the Company s patents and intellectual property solely to perform Adimab s responsibilities under the research plans. Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, the Company has an exclusive option, on a program-by-program basis, to obtain licenses and assignments to commercialize selected products containing or comprising antibodies directed against the applicable target, which option may be exercised upon the payment of a specified option fee for each program. Upon exercise of an option by the Company, Adimab will assign to the Company all right, title and interest in the antibodies of the optioned research program and will grant the Company a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicensable license under the Adimab platform technology for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the antibodies for which the Company has exercised its options and products containing or comprising those antibodies. The Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, seek marketing approval for, and commercialize one product that contains an antibody discovered in each optioned research program. The Company agreed to pay Adimab a quarterly fee of million, which could be cancelled at the Company s option at any time. For so long as the Company was paying such quarterly fee (or earlier if (i) the Company experienced a change of control after the third anniversary of the Adimab Collaboration Agreement or (ii) Adimab owned less than a specified percentage of the Company s equity), Adimab and its affiliates agreed not to assist or direct certain third parties to discover or optimize antibodies intended to bind to coronaviruses or influenza viruses. Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, the Company could also elect to decrease the scope of Adimab s exclusivity obligations and obtain a corresponding decrease in the quarterly fee. In December 2023, the Company elected to decrease the scope of Adimab s exclusivity obligations to cover only coronaviruses and obtained a corresponding decrease in the quarterly fee. Effective January 2024, the Company became obligated to pay Adimab a quarterly fee of million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of research and development expense related to the quarterly fee. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of research and development expense related to the quarterly fee. For each agreed upon research program that is commenced, the Company is obligated to pay Adimab quarterly for its services performed during a given research program at a specified full-time equivalent rate; a discovery delivery fee of million; and an optimization completion fee of million. For each option exercised by the Company to commercialize a specific research program, the Company is obligated to pay Adimab an exercise fee of million. Amounts paid with respect to services performed by Adimab on the Company s behalf in each of the research programs under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement are recognized as research and development expense as such amounts are incurred and services are rendered. During both the three and nine months ended

t recognize any research and development expense with respect to services performed by Adimab on the Company s behalf under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized million and million, respectively, of research and development expense with respect to services performed by Adimab on the Company s behalf under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t recognize any IPR D expense related to drug delivery fees, optimization completion fees or option exercise fees. During both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recognized million, million, and million of IPR D expense related to an option exercise fee, a drug delivery fee and an optimization completion fee, respectively. Please refer to Note 15 for additional information. The Company is obligated to pay Adimab up to million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for each product under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement that achieves such milestones. The next potential milestone under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement is a low single-digit million-dollar clinical milestone, which was not considered probable under U.S. GAAP and therefore, no expense was recognized as of September 30, 2024. The Company is also obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a mid-single-digit percentage based on net sales of any product under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, subject to reductions for third-party licenses. The royalty term will expire for each product on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim of any patent claiming composition of matter or method of making or using any antibody identified or optimized under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement in such country. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay Adimab for Adimab s performance of certain validation work with respect to certain antigens acquired from a third party. In consideration for this work, the Company is obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products that contain such antigens for the same royalty term as antibody-based products, but the Company is not obligated to make any milestone payments for such antigen products. Through September 30, 2024, no royalty payments have been paid to or have been earned by Adimab under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement.

Stock Option Valuation The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Prior to its IPO in August 2021, the Company had been a private company. Due to the proximity to the IPO, the Company continues to lack sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. For options with service-based vesting conditions, the expected term of the Company s stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

 Overview 
 Invivyd, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company devoted to delivering protection from serious viral infectious diseases, beginning with SARS-CoV-2. Our proprietary INVYMAB platform approach combines state-of-the-art viral surveillance and predictive modeling with advanced antibody engineering. INVYMAB is designed to facilitate the rapid, serial generation of new monoclonal antibodies mAbs to address evolving viral threats. 
 On March 22, 2024, we received emergency use authorization EUA from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for PEMGARDA (pemivibart) injection, for intravenous use, a half-life extended investigational mAb, for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise due to certain medical conditions or receipt of certain immunosuppressive medications or treatments and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. Recipients should not be currently infected with or have had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
 In July 2024, we submitted a request to the FDA to amend the EUA for PEMGARDA, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 in certain immunocompromised patients. The submission utilizes a rapid immunobridging pathway previously aligned in principle with the FDA. The EUA amendment request is based on positive immunobridging analyses of pemivibart versus comparator mAbs and data from our ongoing CANOPY Phase 3 clinical trial in participants with moderate-to-severe immune compromise. The COVID-19 treatment EUA request focuses on the critical treatment needs of people in the U.S. who have moderate-to-severe immune compromise and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options are not clinically appropriate or accessible. 
 PEMGARDA is our first mAb in a planned series of innovative mAb candidates designed to keep pace with SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves over time, we anticipate leveraging our INVYMAB platform approach to periodically introduce new or engineered mAb candidates, an approach that would be analogous to the periodic updates made to influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. In January 2024, we nominated VYD2311, a next generation mAb candidate for COVID-19, as a drug candidate, and in September 2024, we announced dosing of the first participants in a Phase 1 clinical trial of VYD2311. VYD2311 is a mAb with high in vitro neutralization potency shown against prominent SARS-CoV-2 variants tested to date. The Phase 1 randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial will evaluate escalating dosing as well as safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of VYD2311 in healthy trial participants. The Phase 1 clinical trial is being conducted in Australia and will evaluate multiple dose levels of VYD2311 through various routes of administration, including exploration of intramuscular administration and subcutaneous administration, which are designed to be more system- and patient-friendly than intravenous administration. We expect preliminary data readouts from the Phase 1 clinical trial late in the fourth quarter of 2024 and anticipate additional clinical readouts from the VYD2311 program throughout 2025. Like pemivibart, VYD2311 was engineered from adintrevimab, our investigational mAb that has a robust safety data package and demonstrated clinically meaningful results in global Phase 2/3 clinical trials for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. 
 In May 2024, we announced general alignment with the FDA on an expedient, repeatable immunobridging pathway to future potential EUAs for serial, novel mAbs for the prevention and treatment of symptomatic COVID-19. This pathway provides us with the opportunity to rapidly, efficiently, and durably deliver high value medicines that prevent and treat symptomatic COVID-19 in vulnerable 
 26 

populations. In addition to developing candidates for COVID-19, we expect to apply our INVYMAB platform approach to produce lead molecules for other viral diseases, such as influenza. 
 Globally, COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths and lasting health problems in many survivors and remains a significant global health concern, particularly for immunocompromised individuals. Isolation and mental health impacts, absenteeism from work, and educational losses for children have been profound consequences of this crisis. COVID-19 persists and continues to impact patients, notably those who are immunocompromised, and combating this disease will require a variety of effective and safe prevention and treatment options for years to come. By leveraging our capabilities, which we have developed through our experience with adintrevimab and pemivibart and over four years in the COVID-19 space, we aim to develop a continuous repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs to keep pace with viral evolution. 
 PEMGARDA has not been approved but has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an EUA, for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain adults and adolescent individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg). The emergency use of PEMGARDA is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act FDCA ), 21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. PEMGARDA is authorized for use only when the combined national frequency of variants with substantially reduced susceptibility to PEMGARDA is less than or equal to 90 , based on available information including variant susceptibility to PEMGARDA and national variant frequencies. 
 We engage in active SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring of antiviral activity as part of our ongoing industrial virology effort, which leverages a consistent, high-quality, independent, third-party pseudoviral system that routinely tests authentic Invivyd-produced molecules and is supported by structure-based analytics. In September 2024, we announced continued neutralizing activity of PEMGARDA (pemivibart) against SARS-CoV-2 variants KP.3.1.1 and LB.1, and attractive neutralization potency of VYD2311 against the same contemporary viruses, and also provided an update to ongoing structural analysis showing no meaningful mutational change in the pemivibart binding site since the Omicron shift late in 2021. 
 Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing, building an intellectual property portfolio, business planning, conducting research and development, establishing and executing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates, and raising capital. Our focus in recent months has been and will continue to be supporting the commercialization of PEMGARDA and establishing streamlined development pathways that could enable us to efficiently introduce new or engineered mAb candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2, leveraging our INVYMAB platform approach and previously generated safety and efficacy data from our clinical trials of adintrevimab and/or pemivibart, including pursuit of a potential EUA for COVID-19 treatment in certain immunocompromised people utilizing a rapid immunobridging pathway. 
 We rely on partnerships, external consultants and contract research organizations CROs to conduct discovery, nonclinical, preclinical, clinical and commercial activities. Additionally, we rely on contract testing laboratories and a contract development and manufacturing organization CDMO to execute our chemistry, manufacturing and controls development, testing and manufacturing activities. We have engaged WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited WuXi Biologics ), a CDMO, for the development and manufacture of our product candidates for clinical and commercial use. Further, in 2022, we secured dedicated laboratory space and expanded our research team in order to enable internal discovery and development of our mAb candidates, while continuing to leverage our existing partnership with Adimab, LLC Adimab ). We are focused on antibody discovery and use of Adimab s platform technology, while building our internal capabilities. In addition, we expect to continue to rely on third parties for clinical trials and the manufacture and testing of our product candidates, as well as to perform ongoing research and development and other services on our behalf. 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily with net proceeds of 464.7 million from sales of our preferred stock, with net proceeds of 327.5 million from our initial public offering IPO ), and with net proceeds of 39.3 million from sales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement (as defined below). After receiving EUA in March 2024, we have also funded our operations from sales of PEMGARDA. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, as they become authorized or approved. 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses, including a net loss of 151.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 883.6 million. We may continue to incur significant expenses and recognize losses in the foreseeable future as we expand and progress our research and development activities, manufacturing activities and commercialization efforts. In addition, our losses from operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities, manufacturing activities, and commercialization efforts. Our expenses could increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: 
 commercialize PEMGARDA; 

initiate and conduct clinical trials of our product candidates; 

develop product candidates in any new indications or patient populations; 

27 

advance our preclinical and discovery programs, including development and screening of additional antibodies, as well as ongoing SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring and testing; 

seek regulatory authorization or approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

pursue coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if authorized or approved; 

acquire or in-license other product candidates, intellectual property and/or technologies; 

further develop and validate our commercial-scale current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP manufacturing process and manufacture material under cGMP at our contracted manufacturing facilities for clinical trials and commercial sales; 

maintain, expand, enforce, defend and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

comply with regulatory requirements established by the applicable regulatory authorities; 

maintain and expand a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory authorization or approval; 

hire and retain personnel, including research, clinical, development, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory, scientific and other personnel; and 

incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company. 

On March 22, 2024, we received EUA from the FDA for PEMGARDA, and as such, we will continue to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. 
 As a result, we will require additional funding through a combination of contribution from revenues, equity offerings, government or private-party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, such as collaborations with other companies, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. We may be unable to secure additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to secure additional funding when needed, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. We may never obtain regulatory authorization or approval for any of our product candidates other than PEMGARDA. Even with product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 
 Based on current operating plans and excluding any contribution from future revenues or external financing, we will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements beyond one year from the issuance date of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and therefore, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Product Revenue, Net 
 In March 2024, we received EUA from the FDA for PEMGARDA. Product revenue, net consists of product revenue earned on the sales of PEMGARDA in the United States. 
 Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue includes PEMGARDA manufacturing costs, labor and overhead costs, and stability study costs. PEMGARDA manufacturing costs include manufacturing materials, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging costs, shipping costs, and royalties. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 The nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generates a significant amount of research and development costs. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for: 
 the nonclinical and preclinical development of our product candidates, including our discovery efforts; 

28 

the procurement of our product candidates from a third-party manufacturer; and 

the global clinical development of our product candidates. 

Such costs consist of: 
 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, third-party fees and other compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, such as collaborators, consultants, contractors and CROs, that conduct the discovery, nonclinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates and research programs; 

costs of procuring manufactured product candidates for use in nonclinical studies, preclinical studies, clinical trials and for commercial supply, prior to receiving authorization or approval, from a third-party CDMO; 

costs of outside consultants and advisors, including their fees and stock-based compensation; 

laboratory-related expenses, which include equipment, laboratory supplies, rent expense, depreciation expense, and other operating costs; 

payments made under third-party licensing agreements; and 

other expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities. 

We expense research and development costs as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered. 
 Our primary focus since inception has been the development of antibodies against COVID-19. Our research and development costs consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to a CDMO, CROs and consultants in connection with our nonclinical studies, preclinical studies, clinical trials and product manufacturing. To date, external research and development costs for any individual product candidate have been tracked commencing upon product candidate nomination. We do not allocate employee-related costs, costs associated with our discovery efforts and other internal or indirect costs to specific research and development programs or product candidates because these resources are used and these costs are deployed across multiple programs under development and, as such, are not separately classified. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher and more variable development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Our research and development expenses will increase as we continue to advance PEMGARDA and as we expect to continue advancing VYD2311 through clinical development, including the associated manufacturing activities, pursue EUA or regulatory approval of our product candidates, and continue to discover and develop additional product candidates. 
 At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales or licensing of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of: 
 the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

filing acceptable IND applications with the FDA or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials for our product candidates; 

sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacture the product candidates and complete associated regulatory activities; 

our ability to establish and maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and successfully develop, obtain regulatory authorization or approval for our product candidates; 

successful enrollment and timely completion of clinical trials, including our ability to generate positive data from any such clinical trials; 

the costs associated with the development of any additional development programs and product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations; 

29 

the prevalence, nature and severity of adverse events experienced with any product candidates; 

the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder; 

our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates, if and when approved, and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; 

our ability to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, including current Good Clinical Practices, current Good Laboratory Practices and cGMPs, and to comply effectively with other rules, regulations and procedures applicable to the development and sale of pharmaceutical products; 

timely receipt of regulatory authorizations or approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

potential significant and changing government regulation, regulatory guidance and requirements and evolving treatment guidelines; and 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or those of third parties with which we work, including as a result of any public health crisis. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. 
 In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, and with a declaration of a public health emergency by the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services HHS ), the FDA has the authority to issue an EUA. While the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by HHS under the Public Health Service Act expired on May 11, 2023, this does not impact the FDA s ability to authorize COVID-19 drugs and biological products for emergency use. On March 22, 2024, we received EUA from the FDA for PEMGARDA. There can be no assurance that the public health emergency in the U.S. declared under the FDCA will continue to be in place for an extended period of time, that any of our other product candidates will be granted an EUA by the FDA, if we apply for such an authorization, or that we would be able to maintain an EUA, such as the EUA received for PEMGARDA, for an extended period of time. The emergency use of PEMGARDA is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564 of the FDCA, unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. 
 Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses 
 Acquired in-process research and development IPR D expenses consist primarily of costs of contingent milestone payments incurred to acquire rights to Adimab s antibodies relating to COVID-19 and SARS and related intellectual property and a license to certain of Adimab s platform patents and technology (the IPR D assets for use in the research and development of our product candidates. We expensed the cost of the IPR D assets because they had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. We will recognize additional IPR D expenses in the future if and when it is deemed probable that we will make contingent milestone payments to Adimab under the terms of the agreement by which we acquired the IPR D assets. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits, third-party fees and other compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our personnel and external contractors involved in our executive, finance, legal, business development and other administrative functions, as well as our commercial function. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs incurred for outside services associated with such functions, including legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; market research costs; and other selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs relate to the operation of the business, unrelated to the research and development function, or any individual program. 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as our business expands and we increase our headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the commercialization of any authorized or approved product candidates, such as PEMGARDA. We also anticipate increased expenses associated with operating as a public company, including increased costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services, director and officer insurance premiums, and investor and public relations costs. We also expect to incur additional intellectual property-related expenses as we file additional patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development activities. 
 In June 2022, and subsequently amended in September 2022 and August 2024, we entered into a lease agreement for dedicated laboratory and office space in Newton, Massachusetts for research and development purposes. Through September 30, 2024, we have operated as a hybrid company with employees working at our corporate headquarters and remotely. We have not incurred material operating expenses for the rent, maintenance and insurance of facilities, or for the depreciation of fixed assets. 
 30 

Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net consists of interest income earned from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the net amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts related to our marketable securities. We expect our interest income to vary each reporting period depending on our average bank deposits, money market funds and investment balances during the period and market interest rates. 
 Income Taxes 
 Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax expense or realized benefits for the net losses we have incurred or for the research and development tax credits generated in each period as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will not be realized. 
 We continue to monitor the manner in which countries will enact legislation to implement the Pillar Two framework proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which proposes a 15 global corporate minimum tax. As of September 30, 2024, various countries have enacted aspects of Pillar Two while committing to enact additional aspects in future years. While we do not expect these rules to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, we continue to monitor these initiatives on a global basis.

The following discussion presents the components of our expenses for the periods presented: 
 Product Revenue, Net 
 Product revenue, net was 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no product revenue, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 9.3 million increase is the result of product sales in the third quarter of 2024 following the launch of PEMGARDA. 
 Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue was 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no cost of product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.8 million increase is the result of PEMGARDA product sales following launch and certain period costs. 
 We began capitalizing our inventory costs in March 2024, in connection with EUA from the FDA and based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of PEMGARDA. Prior to the capitalization of our inventory costs, such costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. Had our pre-EUA manufacturing costs been capitalized, our reported margins would approach 80 .

 Research and development expenses were 57.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 32.3 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the following: 
 the decrease in direct costs related to our VYD222 program resulted from 4.3 million in contract costs for commercial manufacturing, 3.5 million in contract research costs for our CANOPY clinical trial, and 0.2 million in nonclinical expenses, partially offset by increases of 0.3 million in other external expenses; 

the increase in direct costs related to our VYD2311 program resulted from the nomination of our VYD2311 product candidate in the first quarter of 2024 and consisted primarily of contract manufacturing costs; 

the direct costs related to our adintrevimab program were consistent following the nomination of our VYD222 product candidate in the first quarter of 2023; 

the decrease in personnel related costs related to a 1.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation and the capitalization of certain inventory costs which were recorded as research and development personnel related costs prior to the EUA of PEMGARDA; and 

the decrease in external discovery-related and other costs resulted from a 1.9 million decrease in contract manufacturing costs and 0.9 million decrease in other nonclinical expenses, partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in other external costs related to our pipeline candidates. 

Acquired In-Process Research and Development IPR D Expenses 
 There was no IPR D expense recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 IPR D expenses of 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 3.2 million incurred related to a milestone under the Adimab Assignment Agreement and 1.4 million incurred related to an option exercise fee, a drug discovery fee and an optimization completion fee under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following: 
 the decrease in personnel related costs was primarily due to decreases in headcount and stock-based compensation; 

the increase in professional and consultant fees was primarily due to a 3.7 million increase related to the commercialization of PEMGARDA, partially offset by a 1.4 million and 0.3 million decrease in professional service fees and director and officer insurance premiums, respectively; and

other costs remained relatively consistent between periods. 

Other Income 
 Other income was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of interest earned on our invested cash balances. 
 Other income was 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of 1.9 million of interest earned on our invested cash balances and 1.7 million of net accretion of discounts related to our marketable securities.

The following discussion presents the components of our expenses for the periods presented: 
 Product Revenue, Net 
 Product revenue, net was 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was no product revenue, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 11.6 million increase is the result of product sales following the launch of PEMGARDA in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Cost of Product Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue was 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was no cost of product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 0.9 million increase is the result of PEMGARDA product sales following launch and certain period costs. 
 We began capitalizing our inventory costs in March 2024, in connection with EUA from the FDA and based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of PEMGARDA. Prior to the capitalization of our inventory costs, such costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred. Had our pre-EUA manufacturing costs been capitalized, our reported margins would approach 80 .

 Research and development expenses were 119.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 22.9 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the following: 
 the decrease in direct costs related to our VYD222 program resulted from 26.5 million in contract costs for commercial manufacturing and 0.5 million in nonclinical expenses, partially offset by increases of 1.8 million in contract research costs for our CANOPY clinical trial and 0.5 million in other external expenses; 

the increase in direct costs related to our VYD2311 program resulted from the nomination of our VYD2311 product candidate in the first quarter of 2024 and consisted primarily of contract manufacturing costs and nonclinical expenses; 

the decrease in direct costs related to our adintrevimab program of 2.9 million resulted from the nomination of our VYD222 product candidate in the first quarter of 2023; 

the decrease in personnel related costs related to capitalization of 4.0 million of certain inventory costs which were recorded as research and development costs prior to the EUA of PEMGARDA and a 2.6 million decrease primarily due to a reduction in headcount, including a 0.7 million decrease due to stock-based compensation; and 

the decrease in external discovery-related and other costs resulted from a 5.1 million decrease in contract manufacturing costs related to our pipeline candidates and a 2.7 million decrease in other nonclinical expenses, partially offset by a 0.6 million increase in other external costs and 0.2 million in clinical trial expenses. 

Acquired In-Process Research and Development IPR D Expenses 
 There was no IPR D expense recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 IPR D expenses of 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 3.6 million incurred related to milestones under the Adimab Assignment Agreement, 1.4 million incurred related to an option exercise fee, a drug discovery fee and an optimization completion fee under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, and 0.6 million incurred related to license fees under the WuXi Biologics Cell Line License Agreement.

 the increase in personnel related costs was primarily due to an increase in headcount-related costs, including an increase in stock-based compensation expense of 4.0 million that was primarily due to the accelerated vesting of a portion of the outstanding stock options granted to our former Chief Executive Officer, in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement; and 

the increase in professional and consultant fees and other costs of 8.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively, was primarily related to the commercialization of PEMGARDA. 

Other Income 
 Other income was 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of interest earned on our invested cash balances.

Other income was 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of 4.6 million of interest earned on our invested cash balances and 6.4 million of net accretion of discounts related to our marketable securities. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Through September 30, 2024, we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Although we received an EUA from the FDA for PEMGARDA in March 2024, we may continue to incur significant expenses and potential operating losses for the foreseeable future as we commercialize PEMGARDA and advance the development of our other product candidates. To date, we have financed our operations primarily with net proceeds of 464.7 million from sales of our preferred stock, with aggregate net proceeds from our IPO in August 2021 of 327.5 million, and with net proceeds of 39.3 million from sales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement (as defined below). After receiving EUA in March 2024, we have also funded our operations from sales of PEMGARDA. 
 In December 2023, we entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Co., as sales agent Cantor ), pursuant to which we may, at our option, offer and sell shares of our common stock, with a sales value of up to 75.0 million, from time to time, through Cantor, acting as sales agent, in transactions deemed to be at the market offerings , as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Cantor is entitled to a commission of 3 of the gross proceeds from any sales of such shares. In February 2024, we sold 9,000,000 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at an average price of 4.50 per share for 39.3 million in net proceeds. As of September 30, 2024, 34.5 million remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 106.9 million.

Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used 132.9 million of cash, primarily due to our net loss of 151.5 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 18.3 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 0.3 million. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a 16.0 million increase in accrued expenses, a 15.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses, and a 9.7 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a 23.4 million increase in inventory, a 8.1 million increase in accounts receivables, a 7.3 million increase in other non-current assets, a 1.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a 0.7 million decrease in other non-current liabilities. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the utilization of WuXi Biologics manufacturing prepayments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 113.9 million of cash, primarily due to our net loss of 125.0 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of 9.6 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 1.5 million. The changes in our operating assets and liabilities primarily consisted of a 7.7 million increase in accounts payable and a 0.7 million increase in non-current liabilities, partially offset by a 5.5 million decrease in accrued expenses, a 1.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, and a 0.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accounts payable and decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 0.1 million in purchases of property and equipment. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 294.6 million in maturities of marketable securities, offset by 91.2 million in purchases of marketable securities and 0.6 million in purchases of property and equipment. 
 35 

Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 39.3 million from the issuance of common stock under the Sales Agreement, 0.3 million from exercises of stock options, and 0.2 million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan, offset by 0.5 million in payments for offering costs related to the Sales Agreement. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 0.7 million from exercises of stock options and 0.2 million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our expenses could increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the nonclinical and preclinical studies and the clinical trials of our product candidates, including any associated manufacturing activities, and commercialization efforts. Our funding requirements and timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend on many factors, including: 
 the revenue received from sales of PEMGARDA and any other product candidates for which we receive future regulatory authorization or approval; 

the rate of progress in the development of our product candidates; 

the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, nonclinical studies, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates and associated development programs; 

the extent to which we develop, in-license or acquire other product candidates, intellectual property and/or technologies; 

the scope, progress, results and costs of manufacturing and validation activities associated with our current product candidates with the development and manufacturing of our future product candidates as we advance them through preclinical and clinical development; 

the number and development requirements of product candidates that we may pursue; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development capabilities and build and maintain a commercial infrastructure for product candidates for which we obtain regulatory authorization or approval; 

the timing and costs of securing sufficient manufacturing capacity for clinical and commercial supply of our product candidates, or the raw material components thereof; 

the costs and timing of commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory authorization or approval; 

the costs necessary to obtain regulatory authorizations or approvals, and the costs of post-marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where authorization or approval is obtained; 

the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; 

the continuation of our existing licensing and collaboration arrangements and entry into new collaborations and licensing arrangements, if at all; 

the need and ability to hire and retain additional research, clinical, development, scientific and manufacturing personnel; 

the costs we incur in maintaining business operations; 

the need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure; 

the effect of competing technological, product and market developments; 

the costs of operating as a public company; and 

the impact of any business interruptions to our operations or to those of our third-party contractors resulting from any public health crisis. 

Substantial Doubt about Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), we are required to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern from the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements. 
 36 

Based on current operating plans and excluding any contribution from future revenues or external financing, we will not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements beyond one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements, and therefore, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 We expect to finance our operations through a combination of contribution from revenues, equity offerings, government or private-party grants, debt financings or other capital sources, such as collaborations with other companies, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to secure additional funds through contribution from revenues, equity or debt financings or through other sources, when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development programs or any commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates to third parties that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Through September 30, 2024, we committed to noncancelable purchase obligations related to commercial drug substance and drug product manufacturing under the Commercial Manufacturing Services Agreement with WuXi Biologics, which was entered into in December 2020, amended and restated in August 2021 and further amended and restated in September 2023 (as amended and restated, the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement ). As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining contractually binding commercial drug substance and drug product purchase obligations due to WuXi Biologics was 38.3 million, which is expected to be paid in 2024 and 2025. As of September 30, 2024, 36.5 million related to the contractually binding commercial drug substance and drug product batches was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which is expected to be paid in 2024. Through September 30, 2024, we committed to noncancelable purchase obligations of 17.0 million related to the procurement of materials to be used in future drug substance and drug product manufacturing under the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement, which is expected to be paid in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, 10.6 million related to the procurement of materials to be used in future drug substance and drug product manufacturing was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which is expected to be paid in 2024. For additional information, see Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other than the above noted transactions, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations from those described in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in the 2023 Form 10-K. If actual results or events differ materially from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used by us in applying these policies, our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a large accelerated filer, our annual gross revenues exceed 1.235 billion or we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in the previous three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include: 
 37 

an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; 

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; 

exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved; and 

an exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on the financial statements. 

In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1 . Legal Proceedings. 
 On January 31, 2023, a securities class action lawsuit captioned Brill v. Invivyd, Inc., et. al., Case No. 1:23-CV-10254-LTS, was filed against us and certain of our former officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder on the basis of purportedly materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning ADG20 s effectiveness against the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The complaint sought, among other things, unspecified damages, attorneys fees, expert fees, and other costs. The court appointed lead plaintiffs for the action on June 28, 2023. On August 23, 2023, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that made allegations similar to those in the original complaint and asserted the same claims against the same defendants as the original complaint. On October 19, 2023, the parties filed a joint stipulation to advise the court that the lead plaintiffs intended to seek leave to file a second amended complaint, and on November 22, 2023, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that made allegations similar to those in the prior complaints and asserted the same claims against the same defendants as the prior complaints. On January 12, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in its entirety. The lead plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on February 26, 2024, and the defendants filed a reply in further support of their motion to dismiss on March 27, 2024. The court heard oral arguments on the defendants motion to dismiss on May 10, 2024. The court granted the defendants motion to dismiss on September 18, 2024, dismissing the second amended complaint in its entirety, with prejudice and without leave to amend. The plaintiffs did not appeal the court s decision. As such, we have concluded that this matter is closed. 
 
 Item 1A . Risk Factors. 
 Information regarding risks and uncertainties related to our business appears in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K, other than as described below. 
 Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates 
 Our commercial prospects may be harmed if academic or other third-party labs unrelated to Invivyd generate virologic activity data that creates doubt regarding the neutralization activity of pemivibart or any other of Invivyd s product candidates, even if such data is ultimately shown to be inconsistent with neutralization data generated through Invivyd s industrial-grade virology efforts. 
 From time to time, academic or other third-party labs unrelated to Invivyd may produce and run tests on their own molecules meant to resemble Invivyd molecules, such as pemivibart, or run tests on Invivyd molecules utilizing differing assays, and put neutralization findings of unknown quality into the public domain. In connection with the emergency use authorization EUA for PEMGARDA (pemivibart), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA has acknowledged that neutralization findings from sources other than Invivyd s independent, contracted vendor may differ due to, among other reasons, assay differences or because the molecule tested by other labs differs from pemivibart in sequence. Nevertheless, publicly available neutralization data against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are reviewed by the FDA and may be factored into the totality of evidence when considering the potential for adequate neutralization activity of PEMGARDA to support continued emergency use authorization. 
 To the extent that virologic activity data in the public domain generated by academic or other third-party labs unrelated to Invivyd creates doubt regarding the neutralization activity of pemivibart or other Invivyd product candidates, it could adversely impact our regulatory authorization and market acceptance by healthcare providers HCPs or patients, particularly if such publicly available neutralization findings are referenced by the FDA in relation to the regulatory authorization of any Invivyd product candidate, which would adversely affect our commercial prospects and ability to generate revenues, even if such data is preliminary, non-peer-reviewed, and/or generated with molecules that are not authentic Invivyd molecules, and even if such data is ultimately shown to be inconsistent with neutralization data generated through Invivyd s industrial-grade virology efforts. 
 For example, in October 2024, Invivyd withdrew formal revenue guidance for FY2024 following growth headwinds after the FDA updated the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet for HCPs Fact Sheet in August 2024 to include a link to contested, non-peer-reviewed neutralization data of a non-pemivibart antibody generated by an academic lab, which indicated that PEMGARDA may have reduced susceptibility to certain SARS-CoV-2 variants, including KP.3.1.1. In September 2024, we announced that pseudovirus in vitro neutralization data generated by Invivyd s independent, contracted vendor as part of our industrial-grade virology efforts showed continued neutralizing activity of PEMGARDA against KP.3.1.1 and other SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, and later that month, the FDA re-issued an updated PEMGARDA Fact Sheet to provide accurate in vitro neutralization activity of PEMGARDA against dominant circulating variants, including KP.3.1.1. However, this series of events resulted in confusion in the HCP and vulnerable population communities about PEMGARDA and negatively impacted our net product revenue growth. 
 If academic or other third-party labs unrelated to Invivyd generate virologic activity data that creates doubt regarding the neutralization activity of pemivibart or any other of Invivyd s product candidates, our regulatory authorization and our commercial 
 40 

prospects may be harmed, even if such data is ultimately shown to be inconsistent with neutralization data generated through Invivyd s industrial-grade virology efforts. 
 Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 
 We currently rely on third parties to conduct, supervise, analyze and monitor a significant portion of our nonclinical activities and clinical trials for our product candidates, and if those third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise perform satisfactorily, we may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization or approval or successfully commercialize product candidates, or such authorization or approval or commercialization may be delayed or impaired, and our business may be substantially harmed. 
 We have engaged contract research organizations CROs and other third parties to conduct nonclinical activities and clinical trials for our product candidates, and to monitor and manage data. We expect to continue to rely on third parties such as clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct such activities and trials. We also rely on third parties for their research and discovery capabilities, including the nonclinical activity of assay development and virology testing of our product candidates. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us, some in the event of an uncured material breach and some at any time for convenience. If any of our relationships with these third parties terminate, we may not be able to timely enter into arrangements with alternative third parties on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Switching or adding CROs or other third-party vendors requires management time and focus, and may involve substantial cost or result in delays that materially impact our ability to meet our desired program timelines for our product candidates. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs and other third-party vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that any such delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. 
 In addition, any third parties conducting our nonclinical activities or our clinical trials, or monitoring and managing our data, will not be our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the nonclinical, clinical or other data they generate or otherwise obtain is compromised or not timely made available to us or regulatory authorities, due to the failure to adhere to applicable protocols, regulatory requirements, contractual obligations or for other reasons, our preclinical studies or clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, the strength and reliability of our data may be adversely impacted, which may impact our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization or approval, or result in modification to the regulatory authorization or approval documents (e.g., EUA fact sheet, letter of authorization or prescribing information), and may impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be impaired significantly. For example, following receipt of EUA from the FDA in March 2024 for PEMGARDA (pemivibart) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in certain adults and adolescent individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg), we were informed in mid-July 2024 by our third-party authentic virus neutralization assay AVNA vendor that a possible contamination event may have impacted the AVNA potency value generated by such vendor for pemivibart against JN.1, which was the dominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant in the United States between January 2024 and April 2024. Along with the pseudotyped viral neutralization assay PVNA potency value for pemivibart against JN.1, the original PEMGARDA Fact Sheet reflected the AVNA potency value for pemivibart against JN.1.We have been pursuing additional AVNA assay work with multiple third-party AVNA vendors to reassess the AVNA potency value for pemivibart against JN.1, while also working with our third-party PVNA vendor to continue to generate and provide the FDA with PVNA potency data against SARS-CoV-2 variants, as required by the PEMGARDA EUA. As a result of the possible contamination event at our third-party AVNA vendor that may have impacted the AVNA potency value for pemivibart against JN.1, the FDA made modifications to the PEMGARDA Fact Sheet, including, among other changes, removal of the AVNA potency value for pemivibart against JN.1 and incorporation of certain other available information for HCPs to consider when determining whether to prescribe PEMGARDA. 
 Our reliance on CROs and other third parties reduces our control over our nonclinical activities and clinical trials, but does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices cGCPs ), for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. If we or any of our CROs or other third parties, including trial sites, fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before authorizing or approving our product candidates. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices conditions. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory authorization or approval process for our product candidates. 
 41 

We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. This remains our obligation regardless of whether we have contracted any third party to assist and failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. 
 In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the trial. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which may lead to the delay or denial of regulatory authorization or approval for our product candidates. 
 We also expect to rely on other third parties to label, package, store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of such third parties could delay clinical development or marketing approval or authorization of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential revenue. 
 If our CROs or other third-party vendors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise perform satisfactorily, we may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory authorization or approval or successfully commercialize product candidates, or such authorization or approval or commercialization may be delayed or impaired, and our business may be substantially harmed.
