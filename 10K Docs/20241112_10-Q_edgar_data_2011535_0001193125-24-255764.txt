The Fund s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the Sponsor s fee. In exchange for the Sponsor s fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the ordinary fees and expenses incurred by the Fund, including but not limited to the following: the fees charged by the Administrator, the Marketing Agent, the Custodians and the Trustee, Cboe BZX Exchange listing fees, typical maintenance and transaction fees of the DTC, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, tax reporting fees, audit fees, license fees and expenses, and up to 500,000 per annum in ordinary legal fees and expenses.

The Sponsor may, at its sole discretion and from time to time, waive all or a portion of the Sponsor s fee for stated periods of time. The Sponsor is under no obligation to waive any portion of its fees and any such waiver shall create no obligation to waive any such fees during any period not covered by the waiver.

Any ether network fees and similar transaction fees incurred in connection with the creation or redemption of Creation Units are borne by the Authorized Participant. For a period from July 23, 2024 (the day the Shares were initially listed on the Exchange) to January 31, 2025, the Sponsor will waive the entire Sponsor s Fee on the first 10.0 billion of the Fund s assets.

The Fund is an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and, as such, the Fund may elect to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements. The NAV of the Trust is used by the Trust in its day-to-day operations to measure the net value of the Trust s assets. The NAV is calculated on each business day and is equal to the aggregate value of the Trust s assets less its liabilities based on the Index price. In determining the NAV of the Trust on any business day, the Administrator will calculate the price of the ether held by the Trust as of 4:00 p.m. ET on such day. The Administrator will also calculate the NAV per Share of the Trust, which equals the NAV of the Trust divided by the number of outstanding Shares. For purposes of making these calculations, a business day means any day other than a day when the Exchange is closed for regular trading. The Administrator will rely on the Index as the index price to be used when determining NAV. However, determining the value of the Trust s ether using the Index is not in accordance with GAAP, and therefore is not used in the Trust s financial statements. The Trust s ether is carried, for financial statement purposes, at fair value, as required by GAAP. The Trust determines the fair value of ether based on the price provided by the ether market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., ET on the valuation date. The net asset value of the Trust determined on a GAAP basis is referred to as the Principal Market NAV and the net asset value of the Trust per Share determined on a GAAP basis is referred to as the Principal Market NAV per Share. NAV and NAV per Share are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and are not intended as substitute for Principal Market and Principal Market NAV per Share, respectively. Critical Accounting Policy The Trust s and the Fund s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Fund s as well as the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Fund s as well as the Trust s application of accounting policies. Please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report for further discussion of the Trust s and the Fund s accounting policies.

The Fund s NAV per Share began the period at 26.21 and ended the period at 19.98. The decrease in NAV per Share was due to a lower price of ether of 2,628.44 at period end, which represented a decrease of 23.79 from 3,448.77 at July 23, 2024. The change in net assets from operations for the period July 23, 2024 (Date of commencement of operations) to September 30, 2024 was (6,971,976), which was due to (i) payment of the Sponsor s Fee of (10,129), (ii) less waiver and reimbursement of 10,129, and (iii) net realized loss from ether sold for the redemption of shares and sold to pay expenses of (194,831) and (iii) a net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment in ether of (6,777,145). Other than the Sponsor Fee the Fund had no expenses during the period July 23, 2024 to September 30, 2024. 

No comparative period presented as the Fund s operations commenced on July 23, 2024. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Fund is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. The Fund s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the Sponsor s fee. In exchange for the Sponsor s fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the ordinary fees and expenses incurred by the Fund, including but not limited to the following: the fees charged by the Administrator, the Marketing Agent, the Custodians and the Trustee, Cboe BZX Exchange listing fees, typical maintenance and transaction fees of the DTC, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, tax reporting fees, audit fees, license fees and expenses, and up to 500,000 per annum in ordinary legal fees and expenses. The Sponsor will also pay the costs of the Fund s organization and the initial offering costs, and may not seek reimbursement of such costs. The Sponsor is not required to pay any extraordinary or non-routine expenses. The Sponsor s fee is accrued daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.19 of the net asset value of the Fund and is payable at least quarterly in arrears in U.S. dollars or in-kind or any combination thereof. The Sponsor may, at its sole discretion and from time to time, waive all or a portion of the Sponsor s fee for stated periods of time. The Sponsor is under no obligation to waive any portion of its fees and any such waiver shall create no obligation to waive any such fees during any period not covered by the waiver. The Fund will sell ether as needed to pay the Sponsor s fee. For a period from July 23, 2024 (the day the Shares were initially listed on the Exchange) to January 31, 2025, the Sponsor will waive the entire Sponsor s Fee on the first 10.0 billion of the Fund s assets. In the future, if the Sponsor decides to waive all or a portion of the Sponsor s Fee, Shareholders will be notified in a prospectus supplement or on the Sponsor s website for the Fund. The Fund bears transaction costs, including any ether network fees or other similar transaction fees, in connection with any sales of ether necessary to pay the Sponsor s fee, as well as other Fund expenses (if any) that are not assumed by the Sponsor (expenses assumed by the Sponsor are specified above). Any ether network fees and similar transaction fees incurred in connection with the creation or redemption of Creation Units are borne by the Authorized Participant. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At September 30, 2024, the Fund as well as the Trust do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Historical Digital Asset Holdings and Ether Prices Analysis of Movements in the Price of Ether As movements in the price of Ether are expected to directly affect the price of the Fund s shares, it is important for investors to understand and follow movements in the price of Ether.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Fund is a passive investment vehicle and is not a leveraged product. The Sponsor does not actively manage the ether held by the Fund.
