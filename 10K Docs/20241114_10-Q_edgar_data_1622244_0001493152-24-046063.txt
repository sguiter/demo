OWP Ventures prior to the Merger were cancelled; and (e) OWP Ventures chief operating officer became our chief operating officer
and two of OWP Ventures directors became members of our board of directors. The Company s headquarters are located in Las
Vegas, Nevada, and all of its customers are expected to be outside of the United States. On January 10, 2019, the Company changed its
name from Punto Group, Corp. to One World Pharma, Inc., and on November 23, 2021, the Company changed its name to One World Products,
Inc. through the merger of One World Products, Inc., a recently formed Nevada corporation wholly-owned by the Company, with and into
the Company (the Name Change Merger pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes NRS ).
As permitted by the NRS, the articles of merger filed with the Secretary of State of the state of Nevada to effect the Name Change Merger
amended Article I of the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the Company s name to One World Products, Inc. 
The Name Change Merger was effected solely to effect the change of the Company s name, and had no effect on the Company s
officers, directors, operations, assets or liabilities. 

OWP
Ventures is a holding company formed in Delaware on March 27, 2018 to enter and support the cannabis industry, and on May 30, 2018,
it acquired OWP SAS. OWP SAS is a licensed cannabis cultivation, production and distribution (export) company located in
Popay n, Colombia (nearest major city is Cali). The Company had intended to be a producer of and/or source raw and processed
cannabis and hemp plant ingredients for both medical and industrial uses across the globe. The Company received licenses to
cultivate, produce and distribute the raw ingredients of the cannabis and hemp plant for medicinal, scientific and industrial
purposes. Specifically, the Company was one of the few companies in Colombia to receive all four licenses, including seed use,
cultivation of non-psychoactive cannabis, cultivation of psychoactive cannabis, and manufacturing allowing for extraction and
export. Currently, the Company owns approximately 30 acres and has a covered greenhouse built specifically to cultivate high-grade
cannabis and hemp. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company made payments of
approximately 
for a state-of-the-art distillation machine that cleared customs and is currently located in a warehouse near Bogota. 

On
December 22, 2023, OWP SAS, f iled for protection under Colombian Law 1116 of 2006, which is the
primary legislation governing business insolvency proceedings (restructuring and liquidation) Reorganization Proceedings in Colombia. The Reorganization Proceeds are similar to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy
Code in the United States, whereby the Company intended to restructure its debts and continue to operate, however, the Company amended its filing on October 1, 2024, to liquidate
its assets. 

In
connection with the Reorganization Proceedings, OWP SAS paused production and sales of our cannabis operations in Colombia until the
Court provided the Company with a plan of reorganization, at which time the Company intended to resume operations and satisfy its
obligations in Colombia in accordance with the court s plan, however, the Company now intends to have the Court liquidate its
assets and pay its creditors out of the proceeds of the liquidation. As a result of these actions, OWP SAS has no
revenue-producing operations. The Company s primary operations during the fourth quarter of 2023, and to date in 2024, have
consisted of activities associated with completing the Liquidation Proceedings, resolving substantial litigation, claims
reconciliation, terminating operations and liquidating its assets, which primarily consist of the farm in Popay n and equipment.

In
accordance with ASC 810-10-15, the Company has deconsolidated its foreign subsidiaries to include the petitioning entity, OWP SAS,
as well as the Company s non-operating shell entities, Agrobase, S.A.S. and Hope Colombia, S.A.S., given the lack of
independently identifiable operations. The deconsolidation resulted in a loss on deconsolidation of foreign subsidiaries in the
amount of 
and 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. 

During
March of 2024, the Company, through OWP Ventures, began to sell a CBD based product in the United States, called Pro-11. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company began to redesign the packaging and engaged a sales representative
to focus greater resources on bringing this product to market. 

On
May 15, 2024, OWP Ventures, Inc., acquired P talo Pharmaceutical, S.A.S. P talo ), a Company located in
Colombia and legally constituted as a simplified stock company that owns licenses to cultivate, produce and distribute the raw
ingredients of the cannabis and hemp plant for medicinal, scientific and industrial purposes from the free trade zone in Colombia.
P talo had no operations, other than obtaining four licenses, including seed use, cultivation of non-psychoactive cannabis,
cultivation of psychoactive cannabis, and manufacturing allowing for extraction and export from the free trade zone. The acquisition
was accounted for as an asset purchase, and the 
purchase price of P talo was allocated to the fair value of the licenses. The Company intends to establish an export business
within the free trade zone using these licenses, but has yet to incur any substantive income or expenses. 

During 2024, the Company has also been developing industrial hemp solutions for the automotive market. The Company
intends to focus increased efforts on research and development in this area to help the automotive industry meet its goals of achieving
carbon neutral manufacturing using renewable material solutions. In October of 2024, the Company, in collaboration with partners in the
automotive industry, developed hemp-based molded containers for automotive part packaging applications and received an initial order for
1,400 units of these reusable totes, designed to move and protect automotive parts through the supply chain.

Accordingly, we may need to raise additional cash to fund our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
the event sales do not materialize at the expected rates, management would seek additional financing and would attempt to conserve cash
by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives; therefore, without
sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements also do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to scale production and distribution capabilities
and further increase the value of our brands, is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital.

Overview 

We
plan to be a producer of and/or source raw and processed cannabis and hemp plant ingredients for both medical and industrial uses across
the globe. The Company is a holding company and conducts its business in Colombia through OWP SAS, its wholly-owned subsidiary. OWP SAS
has received licenses from the Colombian government to cultivate, produce and distribute the raw ingredients of the cannabis and hemp
plant for medicinal, scientific and industrial purposes in the town of Esmeralda-Popay n, Cauca, Colombia. 

We
are in the process of acquiring another Colombian subsidiary within the Bogota free trade zone, which has all requisite
licenses for the cultivation, production, distribution and export of cannabis and hemp infused products, and will serve as the Company s
primary base of operations in the Colombian market. Establishing operations within the free trade zone provides favorable import/export
commercial terms and taxation, and will improve logistics and the overall operating efficiencies for the Company due to the close proximity
of El Dorado International Airport and the commercial, economic and cultural center of the city of Bogota itself. 

OWP
SAS owns approximately 30 acres and has a covered greenhouse built specifically to cultivate high-grade cannabis and hemp. In addition,
we entered into agreements with a local farming co-operative, under which they will cultivate cannabis on up to approximately 140 acres
of land using our seeds and propagation techniques, and sell their harvested products to us on an exclusive basis. We planted our first
crop of cannabis in 2018, which we harvested in the first quarter of 2019 for the purpose of further research and development activities
and quality control testing of the cannabis we have produced. 

We
have generated revenues since the second quarter of 2020. Between August 2021 and March 2022, we made payments of approximately 1,400,000
for the purchase of a state-of-the-art distillation machine that cleared customs and is currently located in a warehouse near Bogota.
We intend to build out an extraction and production facility in the Bogota free trade zone adjacent to El Dorado International Airport
in Bogota after we execute a lease for this location. Once the extraction equipment is placed in
service, we will be one of the few companies in Colombia to both hold licenses and possess the capability to extract high-quality CBD
and THC oils. 

28 

Due
to challenging economic conditions and under prior management, OWP SAS experienced significant operational and managerial challenges
in 2022 and 2023, resulting its accumulation of financial obligations of approximately 1.2 million, which are substantially past due.
Without adequate resources and in an effort to forestall the imposition of interest, late charges, fines and any court-mandated order(s)
to cease operations, OWP SAS filed for protection under Colombian Law 1116 of 2006, which is the primary legislation governing business
insolvency proceedings (restructuring and liquidation) Reorganization Proceedings in Colombia on December 22, 2023.On October 1, 2024, the Company amended its filing with the Court
to change from a Reorganization Proceeding to a liquidation of its assets, primarily consisting of the farm in Popay n and equipment.
The Company has deconsolidated its foreign subsidiaries to include the petitioning entity, OWP SAS, as well as the Company s non-operating
shell entities, Agrobase, S.A.S. and Hope Colombia, S.A.S., given the lack of independently identifiable operations. The deconsolidation
resulted in a loss on deconsolidation of foreign subsidiaries in the amount of 242,631 and 1,564,823 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. 

On
May 15, 2024, OWP Ventures, Inc., acquired P talo Pharmaceutical, S.A.S. P talo ), a Company located in Colombia
and legally constituted as a simplified stock company that owns licenses to cultivate, produce and distribute the raw ingredients of
the cannabis and hemp plant for medicinal, scientific and industrial purposes from the free trade zone in Colombia. P talo had
no operations, other than obtaining four licenses, including seed use, cultivation of non-psychoactive cannabis, cultivation of psychoactive
cannabis, and manufacturing allowing for extraction and export from the free trade zone. The Company intends to establish an export business
within the free trade zone using these licenses. 

We
expect P talo to start exporting products in 2024, including CBD flower and distillate oil. Our product pipeline may include premium
coffee certified by the Colombian National Coffee Federation infused with CBD, teas infused with CBD and a series of wellness products,
including sports CBD energy drinks for optimum performance, CBD facial and body creams for anti-inflammatory and anti-aging use and white
label commercial agreements with partners in Europe, USA, and Latin America. We recently entered into strategic partnerships with Smokiez
Edibles in Colombia and Stephen Marley s Kx Family Care. There can be no assurances that these strategic partnerships will generate
revenues or be profitable for the Company. 

During 2024, the Company has also been developing industrial hemp solutions for the automotive market. The Company
intends to focus increased efforts on research and development in this area to help the automotive industry meet its goals of achieving
carbon neutral manufacturing using renewable material solutions. In October of 2024, the Company, in collaboration with partners in the
automotive industry, developed hemp-based molded containers for automotive part packaging applications and received an initial order for
1,400 units of these reusable totes, designed to move and protect automotive parts through the supply chain.

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1,010,268, compared to net cash used in operating
activities of 1,043,238 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable
to our net loss. 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 75,000, compared to net cash used in investing activities
of 5,046 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used in investing activities during the current period was for the 75,000
purchase of a subsidiary in Colombia, compared to the prior period, which consisted entirely of purchases of fixed assets. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 1,208,500, compared to net cash provided by
financing activities of 874,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The current period consisted of 150,000 of proceeds received
on the sale of preferred stock and 2,075,500 of proceeds received on debt financing, as partially offset by 1,017,000 of debt repayments,
compared to 250,000 of proceeds received on the sale of preferred stock, 300,000 from the sale of common stock, 262,500 of proceeds
received on debt financing and 62,000 of proceeds received on debt financing received by related parties during the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. 

Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, our balance of cash on hand was 81,630, and we had negative working capital of 3,154,500 and an accumulated
deficit of 30,230,366. We are too early in our development stage to project future revenue levels, and may not be able to generate sufficient
funds to sustain our operations for the next twelve months. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional cash to fund our operations.
These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In
the event sales do not materialize at the expected rates, management would seek additional financing and would attempt to conserve cash
by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives; therefore, without
sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements also do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to scale production and distribution capabilities
and further increase the value of our brands, is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management
to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of
commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our
financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.
Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations
and require management s subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of
their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly
from management s current judgments. 

33 

While
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating
our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we used in the preparation of our financial
statements. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes
revenue from the commercial sales of products, licensing agreements and contracts to perform pilot studies by applying the following
steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction
price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance
obligation is satisfied. The Company s revenues in the current period consisted of the sale of our CBD rub, and in the prior period
revenues consisted entirely of the sale of seeds. The sale of seeds included multi-element arrangements whereby the Company collected
50 of the sale upon delivery of the sales, and the remaining 50 upon the completion of the harvest, whether the seeds result in a successful
crop, or not. In addition, the Company had a right of first refusal to purchase products resulting from the harvest. 

Inventory 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis that approximates the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration, and other factors in evaluating
net realizable value. Our cannabis products consist of cannabis flower grown in-house, along with produced extracts and CBD derived products. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to employees and non-employees in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 Stock Compensation
(ASC 718). All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted
for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the counterparty s
performance is complete or the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached
because of sufficiently large disincentives for nonperformance.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) or in other factors that occurred during the period of our evaluation or subsequent to the date we carried out our
evaluation which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
The design of any system of controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.
There can be no assurance that any system of controls and procedures will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote.
