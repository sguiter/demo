Outlook 

A.C.T. Research Co., LLC A.C.T. Research ), a commercial vehicle industry data and forecasting service provider, currently forecasts new U.S. Class 8 retail truck sales to be 235,000 units in 2024, which would represent a 13.5 decrease compared to 2023. We expect our U.S. market share of new Class 8 truck sales to range between 6.1 and 6.6 in 2024. This market share percentage would result in the sale of approximately 14,500 to 15,500 new Class 8 trucks in 2024. Additionally, we expect to sell approximately 450 new Class 8 trucks in Canada in 2024. 

With respect to new U.S. Class 4 through 7 retail commercial vehicle sales, A.C.T. Research currently forecasts sales to be 268,300 units in 2024, which would represent a 4.2 increase compared to 2023. We expect our U.S. market share of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales to range between 5.0 and 5.4 in 2024. This market share percentage would result in the sale of approximately 13,500 to 14,500 new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles in 2024. Additionally, we expect to sell approximately 550 new Class 5 through 7 commercial vehicles in Canada in 2024. 

We expect to sell approximately 2,000 to 2,200 light-duty vehicles and approximately 6,500 to 7,500 used commercial vehicles in 2024. We expect lease and rental revenue to remain flat during 2024, compared to 2023. 

With respect to our parts, service, and collision center (collectively referred to herein as Aftermarket Products and Services operations, revenues were down slightly year-over-year, but were improved compared to our second quarter results. Although the ongoing freight recession continues to negatively affect Aftermarket Products and Services results, we did experience growth in the third quarter with respect to our over-the-road and wholesale customers for the first time since 2023. We are hopeful that declines in Aftermarket Products and Sales revenues are behind us and that we will begin to experience more normal market conditions starting in the first quarter of 2025. We expect that our Aftermarket Products and Services revenues will remain flat to slightly down in 2024, compared to 2023. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our interim unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and while we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our significant accounting policies.

Key Performance Indicator 

Absorption Ratio 

Management uses several performance metrics to evaluate the performance of our commercial vehicle dealerships and considers Rush Truck Centers absorption ratio to be of critical importance. Our absorption ratio is calculated by dividing the gross profit from our Aftermarket Products and Services departments by the overhead expenses all of a dealership s departments, except for the selling expenses of the new and used commercial vehicle departments and carrying costs of new and used commercial vehicle inventory. When 100 absorption is achieved, the gross profit from the sale of a commercial vehicle, after sales commissions and inventory carrying costs, directly impacts operating profit. Our commercial vehicle dealerships achieved a 132.6 absorption ratio for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a 132.8 absorption ratio for the third quarter of 2023. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

Total revenues decreased 84.6 million, or 4.3 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily the result of the ongoing freight recession resulting in continued weak demand for Class 8 trucks. 

Our Aftermarket Products and Services revenues totaled 633.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, down 1.6 from the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Aftermarket Parts and Services revenues was primarily a result of weaker demand caused by the ongoing freight recession. 

Revenues from sales of new and used commercial vehicles decreased 72.5 million, or 5.9 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in new and used commercial vehicle revenues was primarily a result of weak demand for Class 8 trucks, which was partially offset by strong demand for Class 4 through 7 medium-duty commercial vehicles. 

We sold 3,604 new Class 8 trucks in the third quarter of 2024, a 16.7 decrease compared to 4,326 new Class 8 trucks sold in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in new Class 8 truck sales was primarily due to the ongoing freight recession that is negatively impacting over-the-road-carriers. New U.S. and Canadian Class 8 retail truck sales totaled 73,037 units in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3.5 compared to the third quarter of 2023, according to ACT Research. 

We sold 3,379 new Class 4 through 7 medium-duty commercial vehicles, including 258 buses, in the third quarter of 2024, a 4.2 increase compared to 3,224 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, including 422 buses, in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales was primarily a result of strong demand and increased production of commercial vehicles from the manufacturers we represent. New U.S. and Canadian Class 4 through 7 retail commercial vehicle sales totaled 68,923 units in the third quarter of 2024, down 1.1 compared to the third quarter of 2023, according to ACT Research.

Table of Contents 

We sold 574 light-duty vehicles in the third quarter of 2024, a 35.1 increase compared to 425 light-duty vehicles sold in the third quarter of 2023. 

We sold 1,829 used commercial vehicles in the third quarter of 2024, a 1.8 increase compared to 1,797 used commercial vehicles in the third quarter of 2023. We experienced a slight increase in used commercial vehicle sales year-over-year primarily due to our ability to successfully execute on our commercial vehicle sales strategies. 

Commercial vehicle lease and rental revenues decreased 0.3 million, or 0.4 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease in commercial vehicle lease and rental revenues was primarily a result of a slight decrease in rental vehicle utilization. 

Finance and insurance revenues decreased 0.5 million, or 8.5 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease is primarily due to the decline in sales of Class 8 trucks and tighter lending requirements from finance companies. Finance and insurance revenues have limited direct costs and, therefore, contribute a disproportionate share of our operating profits. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit decreased 15.4 million, or 3.6 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 20.0 in the third quarter of 2024, from 19.9 in the third quarter of 2023. This increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is a result of a change in our product sales mix. Commercial vehicle sales, a lower margin revenue item, decreased as a percentage of total revenues to 61.3 in the third quarter of 2024, from 62.4 in the third quarter of 2023. Aftermarket Products and Services revenues, a higher margin revenue item, increased as a percentage of total revenues to 33.4 in the third quarter of 2024, from 32.5 in the third quarter of 2023. 

Gross margins from our Aftermarket Products and Services operations increased to 36.8 in the third quarter of 2024, from 36.2 in the third quarter of 2023. Gross profit for the Aftermarket Products and Services departments increased to 233.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, from 232.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Historically, gross margins on parts sales range from 28 to 30 and gross margins on service and collision center operations range from 66 to 68 . Gross profits from parts sales represented 57.5 of total gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services operations in the third quarter of 2024 and 58.4 in the third quarter of 2023. Service and collision center operations represented 42.5 of total gross profit for Aftermarket Products and Services operations in the third quarter of 2024 and 41.6 in the third quarter of 2023. We expect blended gross margins on Aftermarket Products and Services operations to range from 36.5 to 37.5 in 2024. 

Gross margins on new Class 8 truck sales decreased to 9.2 in the third quarter of 2024, from 9.9 in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to weak demand caused by the ongoing freight recession. For 2024, we expect overall gross margins from new Class 8 truck sales of approximately 9.0 to 10.0 . 

Gross margins on new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicle sales increased to 10.3 in the third quarter of 2024, from 9.2 in the third quarter of 2023. For 2024, we expect overall gross margins from new medium-duty commercial vehicle sales of approximately 9.0 to 10.0 , but this will largely depend upon the mix of purchasers and types of vehicles sold. 

Gross margins on used commercial vehicle sales increased to 18.0 in the third quarter of 2024, from 11.3 in the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the successful execution of our used commercial vehicle sales strategy. We expect margins on used commercial vehicles to range between 18.0 and 20.0 in 2024. 

Gross margins from truck lease and rental sales decreased to 28.6 in the third quarter of 2024, from 30.6 in the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was primarily related to lower rental utilization. We expect gross margins from lease and rental sales of approximately 28.0 to 30.0 during 2024. 

Finance and insurance revenues and other income, as described above, have limited direct costs and, therefore, contribute a disproportionate share of gross profit.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, General and Administrative SG A expenses decreased 17.4 million, or 6.8 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from reductions to our operating expenses. SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 12.6 in the third quarter of 2024, from 13.0 in the third quarter of 2023. Annual SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues have ranged from approximately 12.4 to 14.4 over the last five years. In general, when new and used commercial vehicle revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues, SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues will be at the lower end of this range. For 2024, we expect SG A expenses as a percentage of total revenues to range from 12.5 to 13.5 . For 2024, we expect the selling portion of SG A expenses to be approximately 25.0 to 30.0 of new and used commercial vehicle gross profit. 

Interest Expense, Net 

Net interest expense increased 3.5 million, or 24.4 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase in interest expense is a result of an increase in our vehicle inventory levels and elevated interest rates on our variable rate debt, compared to the third quarter of 2023. For 2024, we expect net interest expense to increase 34.5 to 37.5 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facilities and the interest related thereto. 

Income before Income Taxes 

As a result of the factors described above, income before income taxes decreased 4.3 million, or 4.0 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

Income Taxes 

Income taxes decreased 3.1 million, or 11.5 , in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. We provided for taxes at a 23.0 effective rate in the third quarter of 2024 and 25.0 in the third quarter of 2023. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5 to 24.5 of pretax income in 2024.

A.C.T. Research estimates that unit sales of new Class 4 through 7 commercial vehicles, including buses, in the U.S increased 0.2 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our short-term cash requirements are primarily for working capital, inventory financing, the renovation and expansion of existing facilities and the construction or purchase of new facilities. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through the retention of profits, borrowings under our floor plan arrangements and bank financings. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of approximately 714.2 million, including 185.1 million in cash, available to fund our operations. We believe that these funds, together with expected cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. From time to time, we utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under various credit agreements. The resulting interest earned on the floor plan credit agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. BMO Harris (the Floor Plan Credit Agreement is recognized as an offset to our interest expense. 

We continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon: (i) our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand; (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations; (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our secured line of credit, working capital lines of credit available under certain of our credit agreements and our Floor Plan Credit Agreement; and (iv) the potential impact of our capital allocation strategy and any contemplated or pending future transactions, including, but not limited to, acquisitions, equity repurchases, dividends, or other capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and working capital requirements, commitments and contingencies, debt repayments, acquisitions, capital expenditures and any operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

We have a secured line of credit that provides for a maximum borrowing of 25.0 million. There were no advances outstanding under this secured line of credit on September 30, 2024, however, 18.9 million was pledged to secure various letters of credit related to self-insurance products, leaving 6.1 million available for future borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 

Our long-term debt, floor plan financing agreements and the credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the WF Credit Agreement require us to satisfy various financial ratios such as the leverage ratio, the asset coverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to debt secured by lease and rental units, our floor plan credit agreements and the WF Credit Agreement. We do not anticipate any breach of these covenants in the foreseeable future. 

We expect to purchase or lease commercial vehicles worth approximately 325.0 million to 350.0 million for our leasing operations during 2024, depending on customer demand. We also expect to make capital expenditures for the purchase of recurring items such as computers, shop tools and equipment and company vehicles of approximately 40.0 million to 45.0 million during 2024. 

During the third quarter of 2024, we paid a cash dividend of 14.2 million. Additionally, on October 28, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.18 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, to be paid on December 12, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of November 12, 2024. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, there is no assurance as to future dividends because the declaration and payment of such dividends is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors and will depend on historic and projected earnings, capital requirements, covenant compliance and financial conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors deem relevant. 

On December 6, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing management to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of 150.0 million of our shares of Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock. In connection with the adoption of the new stock repurchase plan, we terminated the prior stock repurchase plan, which was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023. Repurchases, if any, will be made at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate and may be made through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The actual timing, number of shares and value of repurchases under the stock repurchase program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, stock price and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 77.4 million of our shares of common stock under the current stock repurchase program, excluding federal excise tax. The current stock repurchase program expires on December 31, 2024, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a nondeductible 1 excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We have reflected the applicable excise tax in treasury stock as part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased. 

We anticipate funding the capital expenditures for the improvement and expansion of existing facilities and recurring expenses through our operating cash flows. We have the ability to fund the construction or purchase of new facilities through our operating cash flows or by financing.

Table of Contents 

We have no other material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024. However, we will continue to purchase vehicles for our lease and rental operations and authorize capital expenditures for the improvement or expansion of our existing dealership facilities and construction or purchase of new facilities based on market opportunities.

Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consisted of 229.7 million in net income, as well as non-cash adjustments related to depreciation and amortization of 175.5 million, gain on sale of property and equipment of 0.7 million, stock-based compensation of 24.9 million and the benefit for deferred income tax expense of 11.1 million. Cash used by operating activities included an aggregate of 212.7 million net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Included in the net change in operating assets and liabilities were cash inflows of 11.6 million from the increase in accounts payable, which was offset primarily by cash outflows of 108.1 million from the increase in inventories, 30.5 million from the increase in accounts receivable, 58.2 million from the decrease in customer deposits and 22.3 million from the decrease in accrued expenses. Most of our commercial vehicle inventory is financed through our floor plan credit agreements.

Cash used by operating activities included an aggregate of 252.2 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. Included in the net change in operating assets and liabilities were cash inflows of 4.5 million from the increase in accounts payable, which was offset by cash outflows of 193.7 million from the increase in inventories, 42.8 million from the increase in accounts receivable, 13.3 million from the decrease in customer deposits and 4.1 million from the decrease in accrued expenses.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Cash flows from financing activities include borrowings and repayments of long-term debt and net proceeds of floor plan notes payable, non-trade. During the first nine months of 2024, financing activities resulted in net cash provided by financing activities of 79.9 million, primarily related to 146.0 million from net draws on floor plan notes payable, non-trade, 1,621.3 million from borrowings of long-term debt and 20.2 million from the issuance of shares related to equity compensation plans.

On September 14, 2021, we entered into the WF Credit Agreement with the lenders signatory thereto (the WF Lenders and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association WF ), as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the WF Agent ). Pursuant to the terms of the WF Credit Agreement (as amended), the WF Lenders have agreed to make up to 175.0 million of revolving credit loans for certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases for our Idealease leasing and rental fleet, and general working capital needs. We expect to use the revolving credit loans available under the WF Credit Agreement primarily for the purpose of purchasing commercial vehicles for our Idealease lease and rental fleet. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the WF Credit Agreement from time to time until the maturity date. Borrowings under the WF Credit Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on each interest payment date, as defined in the WF Credit Agreement, at (A) the daily Simple, secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus (i) 1.25 or (ii) 1.5 , depending on our consolidated leverage ratio or (B) on or after the SOFR transition date, SOFR plus (i) 1.25 or (ii) 1.5 , depending on our consolidated leverage ratio. The WF Credit Agreement expires on September 14, 2026, although, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the WF Agent has the right to, or upon the request of the required lenders must, terminate the commitments and declare all outstanding principal and interest due and payable. We may terminate the commitments at any time. On September 30, 2024, we had approximately 175.0 million outstanding under the WF Credit Agreement. 

On November 1, 2023, we entered into certain Second Amended and Restated Inventory Financing and Purchase Money Security Agreement with PACCAR Leasing Company, PLC ), a division of PACCAR Financial Corp., (as amended the PLC Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the PLC Agreement, PLC agreed to make up to 375.0 million of revolving credit loans to finance certain of our capital expenditures, including commercial vehicle purchases and other equipment to be leased or rented through our PacLease franchises. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts pursuant to the PLC Agreement from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the borrowing base. In addition, we must maintain a minimum balance of 190.0 million. Advances under the PLC Agreement bear interest per annum, payable on the fifth day of the following month, at our option, at either (A) the prime rate, minus 1.95 , provided that the floating rate of interest is subject to a floor of 0 , or (B) a fixed rate, to be determined between us and PLC in each instance of borrowing at a fixed rate. The PLC Agreement expires on December 1, 2025, although either party has the right to terminate the PLC Agreement at any time upon 180 days written notice. On September 30, 2024, we had approximately 190.0 million outstanding under the PLC Agreement. 

Most of our commercial vehicle purchases are made on terms requiring payment to the manufacturer within 15 to 60 days or less from the date the commercial vehicles are invoiced from the factory. Navistar Financial Corporation and Peterbilt offer trade terms that provide an interest-free inventory stocking period for certain new commercial vehicles. This interest-free period is generally 15 to 60 days. If the commercial vehicle is not sold within the interest-free period, we then finance the commercial vehicle under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement. On September 14, 2021, we entered into Floor Plan Credit Agreement with BMO Harris and the lenders signatory thereto. The Floor Plan Credit Agreement includes an aggregate loan commitment of 1.0 billion. Prior to June 1, 2023, borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement bore interest at an annual rate equal to (A) the greater of (i) zero and (ii) one month London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), determined on the last day of the prior month, plus (B) 1.10 and were payable monthly. On May 31, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to the Floor Plan Credit Agreement that changed the benchmark interest rate to SOFR. Effective June 1, 2023, borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement now bear interest per annum, payable monthly, at (A) the greater of (i) zero and (ii) SOFR, plus (B) 1.20 . Borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement for the purchase of used inventory are limited to 150.0 million and loans for working capital purposes are limited to 200.0 million. The Floor Plan Credit Agreement expires September 14, 2026, although BMO Harris has the right to terminate at any time upon 360 days written notice and we may terminate at any time, subject to specified limited exceptions. On September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.0 billion outstanding under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement. The average daily outstanding borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement were 975.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We utilize our excess cash on hand to pay down our outstanding borrowings under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement, and the resulting interest earned is recognized as an offset to our gross interest expense under the Floor Plan Credit Agreement.

Effective June 1, 2024, borrowing under the RTC Revolving Credit Agreement now bear interest per annum payable monthly at CORRA, plus 1.72 . The RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement expires September 14, 2026. On September 30, 2024, we had approximately 38.4 million CAD outstanding under the RTC Canada Revolving Credit Agreement. 

On July 15, 2022, RTC Canada entered into that certain Amended and Restated BMO Wholesale Financing and Security Agreement (the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement with Bank of Montreal BMO ). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, BMO agreed to make up to 116.7 million CAD of revolving credit loans to finance RTC Canada s purchase of new and used vehicle inventory. Loans to purchase used vehicle inventory are limited to twenty percent (20 of the credit limit available at such time. RTC Canada may borrow, repay and reborrow loans from time to time until the maturity date, provided, however, that the outstanding principal amount on any date shall not exceed the credit limits set forth above with respect to new and used vehicles. Prior to June 1, 2024, borrowings with respect to advances required to be made in CAD dollars bore interest per annum, payable monthly, at CDOR, plus 0.90 . On June 1, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement that changed the benchmark interest rate with respect to advances required to be made in CAD dollars to CORRA. Effective June 1, 2024, advances required to be made in CAD dollars under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement now bear interest per annum, payable monthly, at CORRA, plus 1.27 . In addition, prior to June 1, 2023, advances required to be made in USD dollars bore interest, payable monthly, at LIBOR, plus 1.10 . On June 1, 2023, RTC Canada entered into the First Amendment to the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement that changed the benchmark interest rate in the case of an advances required to be made in USD dollars to SOFR. Effective June 1, 2023, advances required to be made in USD dollars under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement bear interest per annum, payable monthly, at SOFR, plus 1.20 . The RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement expires September 14, 2026. On September 30, 2024, we had approximately 109.0 million CAD outstanding under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Agreement. The average daily outstanding borrowings under the RTC Canada Floor Plan Credit Agreement were 76.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Backlog 

On September 30, 2024, our backlog of commercial vehicle orders was approximately 1,332.9 million, compared to a backlog of commercial vehicle orders of approximately 3,297.4 million on September 30, 2023. The decrease in our backlog primarily reflects the decreased demand for new Class 8 trucks resulting from production catching up to pent-up demand and the ongoing freight recession. Our backlog is determined quarterly by multiplying the number of new commercial vehicles for each type of commercial vehicle ordered by a customer at our Rush Truck Centers by the recent average selling price for that type of commercial vehicle. We include only confirmed orders in our backlog. However, such orders are subject to cancellation. In the event of order cancellation, we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The delivery time for a custom-ordered commercial vehicle varies depending on the truck specifications and demand for the model ordered. We sell the majority of our new heavy-duty commercial vehicles by customer special order and we sell the majority of our medium and light-duty commercial vehicles out of inventory. Orders from our major fleet customers are included in our backlog as of September 30, 2024, and we expect to fill most of our backlog orders during the remainder of 2024. 

Seasonality 

Our Truck Segment is moderately seasonal. Seasonal effects on new commercial vehicle sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the diverse geographic locations of our dealerships and our diverse customer base, including regional and national fleets, local and state governments, corporations and owner-operators. However, Aftermarket Products and Services operations historically have experienced higher sales volumes in the second and third quarters. 

Cyclicality 

Our business is dependent on several factors including general economic conditions, fuel prices, interest rate fluctuations, credit availability, environmental and other government regulations and customer business cycles. Unit sales of new commercial vehicles have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on these general economic conditions. According to data published by A.C.T. Research, in the last ten years, total U.S. retail sales of new Class 8 commercial vehicles have ranged from a low of approximately 187,600 in 2013, to a high of approximately 281,440 in 2019. Through geographic expansion, concentration on higher margin Aftermarket Products and Services and diversification of our customer base, we have attempted to reduce the negative impact of adverse general economic conditions or cyclical trends affecting the Class 8 commercial vehicle industry on our earnings.

Environmental Standards and Other Governmental Regulations 

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing the following: discharges into the air and water; the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks; the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, petroleum and other materials; and the investigation and remediation of environmental impacts. As with commercial vehicle dealerships generally, and vehicle service, parts and collision center operations in particular, our business involves the generation, use, storage, handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous materials or wastes and other environmentally sensitive materials. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations. 

Our operations involving the use, handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous materials are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. Pursuant to these laws, federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of regulated substances with which we must comply. Our business also involves the operation and use of aboveground and underground storage tanks. These storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal under RCRA and comparable state statutes. Furthermore, investigation or remediation may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from current or former underground or aboveground storage tanks. 

We may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling, treatment, or disposal facilities under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state statutes. These statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of environmental impacts without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the impacts. Responsible parties under these statutes may include the owner or operator of the site where impacts occurred and companies that disposed, or arranged for the disposal, of the hazardous substances released at these sites. These responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other materials into the environment. 

The federal Clean Water Act and comparable state statutes require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans. Water quality protection programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations. Similarly, the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state statutes regulate emissions of various air emissions through permitting programs and the imposition of standards and other requirements. 

The Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA ), on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation, issued rules associated with reducing greenhouse gas GHG emissions and improving the fuel efficiency of medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses for current model years through 2027. In March 2024, the EPA issued additional rules associated with reducing GHG emissions from medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses for model years 2027 through 2032. In addition, in August 2021, the President of the United States issued an executive order intended to increase fuel efficiency, further reduce GHG emissions and speed up the development of zero-emission vehicles. The executive order calls for the EPA and the Secretary of Transportation to adopt new rules and regulations for commercial vehicles starting as early as model year 2027. Similarly, in June 2020, the California Air Resources Board CARB adopted a final rule that is intended to phase out the sale of internal combustion engine commercial vehicles over time by requiring a certain percentage of each manufacturer s commercial vehicles sold within the state to be zero-emission vehicles, or near-zero emission vehicles, starting in model year 2024. In July 2023, CARB and various manufacturers of heavy-duty commercial vehicles and engines, including PACCAR, International, Ford, Hino, Isuzu and Cummins, entered into the Clean Truck Partnership, whereby the manufacturers agreed to comply with CARB s emission requirements where applicable, regardless of whether any entity challenges CARB s rule-making authority, and CARB agreed to work with manufacturers to provide reasonable lead time to meet CARB s requirements and before imposing new regulations. In addition, CARB agreed to align its nitrogen oxide emissions rules with the EPA s, which go into effect starting in model year 2027, and modify certain of its 2024 nitrogen oxide emissions regulations currently in effect, with respect to which manufacturers may provide certain offsets to meet CARB s emission target in exchange for the ability to sell legacy engines. Since July 2020, a group of seventeen U.S. states and the District of Columbia have entered into a joint memorandum of understanding that adopts at least a portion of CARB s emissions regulations and commits each of them to work together to advance and accelerate the market for electric Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles. Six of the states are states where we operate new commercial vehicle dealerships: California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Virginia. The signatories to the memorandum all agreed on a goal of ensuring that 100 of new Class 3 through 8 commercial vehicles are zero emission by 2050, with an interim target of 30 zero emission vehicles by 2030. Attaining these goals would likely require the adoption of new laws and regulations and we cannot predict at this time whether such laws and regulations would have an adverse impact on our business. Additional regulations, or CARB s enforcement of its existing regulations, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions, or changes in demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We do not believe that we currently have any material environmental liabilities or that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. However, soil and groundwater impacts are known to exist at some of our dealerships. Further, environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. In addition, in connection with acquisitions, it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities, some of which may be material. In connection with our dispositions, or prior dispositions made by companies we acquire, we may retain exposure for environmental costs and liabilities, some of which may be material. Compliance with current or amended, or new or more stringent, laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition, such laws could affect demand for the products that we sell. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in financial market prices, including interest rate risk, and other relevant market rate or price risks. 

We are exposed to market risk through interest rates related to our floor plan financing agreements, the WF Credit Agreement, the PLC Agreement and discount rates related to finance sales. Our floor plan debt is based on SOFR and CORRA, the WF Credit Agreement is based on SOFR, the RTC Canada Revolving Agreement is based on CORRA and the PLC Agreement is based on the prime rate. As of September 30, 2024, we had floor plan borrowings and borrowings from BMO Harris, WF, PLC and BMO in the amount of 1,676.1 million. Assuming an increase or decrease in SOFR, CORRA or the prime rate of 100 basis points, annual interest expense could correspondingly increase or decrease by approximately 16.8 million. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 

The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company s principal executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including the principal executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time, we are involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the ordinary course of business. We maintain liability insurance, including product liability coverage, in amounts deemed adequate by management. However, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or claim for which indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of September 30, 2024, we believe that there are no pending claims or litigation, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred.
