The CapGrow Portfolio is geographically dispersed, and management evaluates operating performance on a total portfolio basis. The aggregation of individual homes constitutes the total portfolio. Decisions regarding acquisitions and dispositions of homes are made at the individual home level with a focus on accretion in high-growth locations where there is greater scale and density.

 Business Combination 
 
 On January 4, 2023, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, acquired a controlling indirect interest in CapGrow at a total enterprise value of approximately million. Debt of approximately million was assumed in the transaction which resulted in an approximate cash outlay of million by the Company to acquire this interest. As part of this transaction, CapGrow retained the employees responsible for implementing strategic decisions relating to acquisitions, dispositions and cash flow management, including CapGrow s chief executive officer. Since the Company consolidates CapGrow as it is the primary beneficiary of CapGrow Member and accounts for this transaction as a business, the Company recognizes all of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest in CapGrow Member and CapGrow JV at the acquisition-date fair value. Goodwill was recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred and the net assets acquired, including the noncontrolling interests. The material components of goodwill, amounts paid in excess of amounts attributable to the fair value of the net assets acquired, represent the value assigned to a growing and profitable business that includes an experienced management team and the expected synergies and continued expansion of CapGrow's operations. The members of CapGrow s management have been with CapGrow for five to . The senior members have specific skill sets and significant industry knowledge, including its regulatory and policy environment. These elements make up goodwill, which does not qualify for separate recognition.

 Financing Obligation, Net 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of University Courtyard in October 2023, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback transaction whereby the underlying land was sold to an unaffiliated third party for million and simultaneously entered into a lease agreement with the same unaffiliated third party to lease the property back. The sale and leaseback of University Courtyard is accounted for as a failed sale and leaseback because the lease is classified as a finance lease. Accordingly, the sale of the underlying land is not recognized and the property continues to be included within the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company will continue to depreciate the property as if the Company is the legal owner. The proceeds received from the sale, net of debt financing costs of million, are accounted for as a financing obligation on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company allocates the rental payments under the lease between interest expense and principal repayment of the financing obligation using the effective interest method and amortization over the lease term. The total principal payments are not expected to exceed the difference between the gross proceeds from the sale of million and the initial carrying value of the land of million, resulting in maximum principal payments of million over the term of the arrangement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of financing obligation was million.

 Share Repurchase Plan 
 
 On February 10, 2023, the Company adopted a Share Repurchase Plan (the Repurchase Plan ), whereby, subject to certain limitations, stockholders may request on a monthly basis that the Company repurchase all or any portion of their shares. The total amount of aggregate repurchases of the Company s stock is limited during each calendar month to of the aggregate NAV of all classes as of the last calendar day of the previous quarter and in each calendar quarter will be limited to of the aggregate NAV of all share classes as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter; provided, however, that every month and quarter each class of the Company s stock will be allocated capacity within such aggregate limit to allow stockholders in such class to either (a) redeem shares equal to at least of the aggregate NAV of such share class as of the last calendar day of the previous quarter, or, if more limiting, (b) redeem shares over the course of a given quarter equal to at least of the aggregate NAV of such share class as of the last calendar day of the previous quarter. Shares will be repurchased at a price equal to the transaction price on the applicable repurchase date, subject to any Early Repurchase Deduction (as defined below). The transaction price will generally equal the prior month s NAV per share for that share class. Shares repurchased within of the date of issuance will be repurchased at of the current transaction price (the Early Repurchase Deduction ). The Early Repurchase Deduction will not apply to shares acquired through the distribution reinvestment plan. Due to the illiquid nature of investments in real estate, the Company may not have sufficient liquid resources to fund repurchase requests, and the Company has established limitations on the amount of funds it may use for repurchases during any calendar month and quarter as described above. The Company s Board may modify, suspend or terminate the Repurchase Plan. Repurchases under the Repurchase Plan began in July 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were shares repurchased under the Repurchase Plan. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased million of shares of common stock. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 To comply with the REIT provisions of the Code, the Company generally intends to distribute substantially all of its taxable income, which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP, to our stockholders beginning January 1, 2023 and each year thereafter. 
 
 Each class of common stock receives the same gross distribution per share. The net distribution varies for each class based on the applicable distribution fee, which is deducted from the monthly distribution per share and paid directly to the applicable distributor, and/or certain other class-specific fees, as applicable.

 Share-Based Compensation Plan 
 
 On March 7, 2023, the Board approved the independent director compensation plan (the Compensation Plan ), which provides independent directors an initial one-time grant of Class F restricted shares of common stock valued at Initial Grant ), annual compensation consisting of a number of restricted shares Equity Retainer valued at and all or a portion of their cash compensation Cash Retainer if the independent directors elect to receive such cash compensation in the form of restricted shares of the Company s common stock. Prior to September 3, 2023, any grant of restricted stock was based on the then-current per share transaction price of the Class F shares at the time of grant. In April 2024, the Board approved the exchange of these Class F shares for a number of Class E shares with an equivalent aggregate net asset value. Thereafter, any grant of restricted stock will be based on the then-current per share transaction price of the Class E shares at the time of grant. Restricted stock grants will generally vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. During the restricted period, these restricted shares are automatically subject to the Company's DRIP with all dividends and other distributions declared and paid in respect of such restricted shares being applied to the purchase of additional restricted shares of the same class until the later of (i) such restricted shares becomes fully vested or (ii) receipt of nonparticipation in the DRIP by such independent director. The maximum number of shares that will be available for issuance under the Compensation Plan is . 
 
 In March 2023, the Company granted approximately million or approximately Class F restricted shares of common stock which represented the Initial Grant, Equity Retainer and a portion of the Cash Retainer that the independent directors have elected to receive in restricted shares of stock. These restricted stock grants along with the additional restricted shares earned under the DRIP vested between February 2024 and April 2024. Upon the Board s approval, all Class F Shares previously granted were exchanged for Class E Shares of common stock. In June 2024, the Company granted approximately million or approximately Class E restricted shares which represented the Equity Retainer and a portion of the Cash Retainer that the independent directors have elected to receive in restricted shares of common stock. These restricted stock grants along with the additional restricted shares earned under the DRIP will vest in June 2025. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the Compensation Plan. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total compensation cost recognized was million and million, respectively. During each of the 2024 Successor Interim Period and 2023 Successor Interim Period, total compensation cost recognized was million and million, respectively. T he Company adopted the policy of accounting for forfeitures as they occur. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects that the independent directors will complete their requisite service period. If awards are ultimately forfeited prior to vesting, then the Company will reclassify amounts previously charged to retained earnings to compensation cost in the period the award is forfeited. 
 
 Non-controlling Interest in the Operating Partnership 
 
 As discussed in Note 10, Related Party Transactions, the Special Limited Partner holds a performance participation interest in the Operating Partnership. Because the Special Limited Partner has the ability to redeem its Class E units for cash or Class E shares, at its election, the Company has classified these Class E units as a redeemable non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The redeemable non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership is recorded at the greater of the carrying amount, adjusted for its share of the allocation of income or loss and dividends, or the redemption value, which is equivalent to fair value, of such units at the end of each measurement period.

 Within CapGrow, the members obligations and rights relating to contributions, distributions, allocation of income and loss, among others, are governed by CapGrow s limited liability company agreement, as further amended from time to time (the CapGrow Agreement ). Distributions of available cash are distributed to the members of CapGrow based on their respective membership interests until certain internal rate of return thresholds are met. As the rate of return thresholds are achieved, the allocation of distributions is modified as further described in the CapGrow Agreement. Income or losses are allocated to the members in amounts that result in ending capital account balances reflecting the amounts that would be distributed to them assuming CapGrow was liquidated at book value at the end of the reporting period.

No management fee will be paid with respect to Class E Common Shares or Class E Units, which are only expected to be held by Sculptor, its personnel and affiliates. In calculating the management fee, the Company will use its NAV and the NAV of the Operating Partnership units not held by the Company before giving effect to monthly accruals for the management fee, the performance participation allocation, distribution fees or distributions payable on the Company s shares of stock or Operating Partnership units. 
 
 The management fee, which is due monthly in arrears, may be paid, at the Adviser s election, in cash, Class E shares or Class E units of our Operating Partnership. The Adviser may defer the payment of management fee at its discretion.

 Valuation of Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 When performing a business combination or asset acquisition, the Company is required to measure assets and liabilities at fair value as of the acquisition date consistent with ASC 805. The fair value of each property is determined primarily based on unobservable data inputs, which utilized market knowledge obtained from historical transactions and published market data. Typically, the Company allocates of the purchase price to land. Any above- and below market lease intangibles are derived (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) based on the difference between contractual rent and market rent, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of each of the leases, including the renewal options for below market leases. In estimating in-place leases and deferred commissions, the Company uses estimates of its carry costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods and costs to execute similar leases, which include estimates of lost rental at market rates as well as leasing commissions. Debt is valued by a third-party appraiser, utilizing the discounted cash flow and inputs such as discount rate, prepayment speeds, general economic and industry trends. All of these inputs are classified as Level 3 inputs. 
 
 Certain of the Company s assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments, such as when there is evidence of impairment, and therefore measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company reviews its real estate properties for impairment each quarter or when there is an event or change in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amount of the real estate value may not be recoverable. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2024 Successor Interim Period, the Company recorded impairment losses in respect of the assets sold, held for sale properties and certain vacant properties where leases were terminated and the expected sales proceeds were lower than the carrying value of the properties. The fair value of these impaired assets is primarily based on the sale price pursuant to the binding executed contracts or list price less estimated costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 input. Refer to Note 3, Investments in Real Estate, for additional disclosure relating to asset impairment.

 Revolving credit facility Financing obligation (1) The carrying value of these loans do not include unamortized debt issuance costs. 

The fair value of the Company s borrowings is estimated by modeling the cash flows required by our debt agreements and discounting them back to present value using the appropriate discount rate. Additionally, the Company considers current market rates and conditions by evaluating similar borrowing agreements with comparable loan-to-value ratios and credit profiles. The inputs used in determining the fair value of our borrowings are considered Level 3.

 There are no cross-default provisions among the leases with the subsidiaries of Sevita. Although Sevita is not a party to these leases, Sevita has entered into separate guarantee agreements with respect to of CapGrow s properties as of September 30, 2024, which represents approximately of the total rental income during the 2024 Successor Interim Period and of total assets as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, Sevita had guarantee agreements with respect to of CapGrow s properties, which represents approximately of the total rental income during the 2023 Successor Interim Period and of total assets as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 During the 2024 Successor Interim Period and 2023 Successor Interim Period, there are four tenants that each represent more than 5 of CapGrow s rental income, and collectively, the leases on the properties with these tenants represent over and of the Company s rental income. While this represents a significant concentration risk with regard to CapGrow s revenue, the credit risk associated with these tenants is mitigated since the payor stream is principally derived through Medicaid waivers. A majority of the CapGrow Portfolio is located in Texas, Minnesota and Ohio. 
 
 University Courtyard units are rented generally under lease agreements with terms of one year or less, renewable on an annual or monthly basis. All of the University Courtyard leases as of September 30, 2024 expire on or before July 2025 as is customary for student housing where lease terms are generally based on the start of the academic year in the fall.

 Overview 
 Sculptor Diversified Real Estate Income Trust invests primarily in stabilized income-generating commercial real estate across a variety of both traditional and non-traditional sectors in the U.S. and Europe, and to a lesser extent, invests in real estate related securities. The Company is the sole general partner and a limited partner of Sculptor Diversified REIT Operating Partnership LP (the Operating Partnership ), and we own substantially all of our assets through the Operating Partnership. We are externally managed by Sculptor Advisors LLC, an affiliate of Sculptor. 
 
 The Company was formed on February 11, 2022 Inception as a Maryland corporation and has operated and elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2023. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership are externally managed by our adviser, Sculptor Advisors LLC (in its capacity as our adviser, the Adviser ), a Delaware limited liability company and a registered investment adviser. Our Adviser is an affiliate of Sculptor Capital Management, Inc., our sponsor (together with its affiliates, Sculptor ). Sculptor Diversified REIT Special Limited Partner LP (the Special Limited Partner ), an affiliate of the Adviser, owns a special limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership. 
 
 The Company s board of directors has at all times oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to an advisory agreement, the Company has delegated to the Advisor the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of directors. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company owns (a) a 79.98 indirect controlling interest in CapGrow Holdings Member, LLC (the CapGrow Member or the Predecessor ), which holds an interest in CapGrow Holdings JV LLC (the CapGrow JV, and together with CapGrow Member, CapGrow ), that owns a portfolio of primarily single-family homes (the CapGrow Portfolio leased to and operated by care providers that serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and (b) a 90 equity interest in a joint venture (the Denton JV that owns University Courtyard, a 240-unit, 792-bed student housing property located in Denton, Texas. See Investment Portfolio below for additional information on these investments. 
 34 

On February 23, 2024, CapGrow, CapGrow s founder and CapGrow Neptune Investor LLC (the Neptune Investor ), an affiliate of Sculptor, formed a joint-venture, CapGrow Neptune JV LLC (the Neptune JV ), and closed on the acquisition of Newport, a portfolio of 33 single-family residences and intermediate care facilities located in California and Minnesota. 
 
 Current Market Conditions and Related Risks and Opportunities 
 
 The Company s business is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world. High interest rates and a reduction in the availability of financing, especially from banks, has led to greater spreads between the prices sought by sellers and buyers, which may adversely affect the value of our real estate assets. However, given that we are seeking to raise and invest substantial equity capital, we believe that market stresses could lead to attractive acquisition opportunities. While higher interest rates make financing more expensive, CapGrow has the benefit of having previously locked in all of its mortgage loans at favorable fixed interest rates, which represented approximately 78 of our total debt obligations. Also, we were able to secure a five-year interest rate protection agreement which caps University Courtyard s mortgage at a fixed interest rate of 3.56 . The only variable rate loan that is indexed to SOFR is CapGrow s revolving credit facility, which had a balance of 14.4 million as of September 30, 2024. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in SOFR would have resulted in an increase or decrease in interest expense of 0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources below. In general, higher interest rates will increase CapGrow s financing costs associated with newly acquired homes and are also likely to adversely affect the financial performance of our tenants, which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 High interest rates will also increase the federal government s interest payments and contribute to growing federal deficits, which deficits may lead to efforts to cut federal spending. Such efforts could result in lower Medicaid expenditures, on which CapGrow s lessees and tenants rely. In addition, inflation, which has been pronounced over the last 2.5 years, may result in higher general and administrative expenses for our Company and for our tenants. Insurance costs in certain markets have increased more than inflation due to property locations in high risk markets and higher property replacement costs. Further, state and local governments may also look to increase real estate taxes and other related fees in order to offset lower revenues from other sources. While CapGrow s leases are triple net or modified net, high insurance costs and real estate taxes may result in higher overall occupancy expenses for tenants. 
 
 Investing in commercial real estate assets also involves certain risks, including but not limited to, tenants inability to pay rent (whether due to property-specific factors, company-specific factors, sector-level issues, or broader macroeconomic conditions), increases in interest rates and lack of availability of financing, tenant turnover and vacancies and changes in supply of or demand for similar properties in a given market. Any negative changes in these factors could affect the Company s performance and our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to shareholders. 

Q3 2024 Highlights 
 
 Operating Results 
 We declared monthly distributions totaling 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our investments in CapGrow and University Courtyard produced operating earnings and distributions that contributed to our total return. The details of the annualized distribution rate and total returns are shown in the following table: 

Class F Class FF Class E Class AA Class A Annualized Distribution Rate (1) 
 6.98 6.56 6.91 6.56 7.18 Year-to-Date Total Return, without upfront selling commissions (2) 
 6.54 6.19 8.77 4.82 1.51 Year-to-Date Total Return, assuming maximum upfront selling commissions (2)(3) 
 4.41 4.07 8.77 2.73 (0.52) Inception-to-Date Total Return, without upfront selling commissions (2) 
 11.73 9.65 8.28 4.82 1.51 Inception-to-Date Total Return, assuming maximum upfront selling commissions (2)(3) 
 10.46 8.11 8.28 2.73 (0.52)

____________________________________________________________________________ (1) 
 The annualized distribution rate is calculated as the September distribution annualized and divided by the prior month s net asset value, which is inclusive of all fees and expenses. 
 (2) 
 Total return is calculated as the change in NAV per share during the respective periods plus any distributions per share declared in the period and assumes any distributions are reinvested in accordance with our distribution reinvestment plan. Total return for periods greater than one year are annualized. Class E shares are not subject to any upfront selling commissions. Class F shares, Class FF shares, Class AA and Class A shares were first issued to third parties on December 27, 2022, May 1, 2023, February 1, 2024 and August 1, 2024, respectively. Class E shares were first issued to our Adviser on December 1, 2023. (3) 
 There were no selling commissions charged in respect of the Class F, Class A and E shares. 
 Investments 
 We acquired ten vacant homes through CapGrow at an aggregate purchase price of 4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which were leased to tenants following their acquisition. 
 We sold two CapGrow homes for aggregate net proceeds of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital and Financing Activity 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we raised an aggregate of 8.3 million of proceeds from the sale of our common shares, including proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan, and did not receive any repurchase requests for our common shares. 
 CapGrow incurred additional borrowings of 2.3 million from the revolving credit facility to partly fund CapGrow s asset acquisitions during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 CapGrow repaid 1.2 million of its mortgage loans as part of its scheduled debt service payments and as a result of asset sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Subsequent Event Highlights 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we raised aggregate net proceeds of 5.4 million from the sale of our common shares, and repurchased 0.1 million of shares of common stock.

 ______________________________________________ 
 (1) Ownership interest as September 30, 2024. Certain of the joint venture agreements entered into by us provide the other partner a profits interest based on certain internal rate of return hurdles being achieved. Such investments are consolidated by us and any interests due to the other partner will be reported within non-controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 (2) The occupancy rate is defined as the number of leased units/homes divided by the total units/homes as of September 30, 2024. For student housing, occupancy is defined as the percentage of occupied beds as of September 30, 2024. 
 (3) As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned a 79.98 effective equity interest in CapGrow. The Company has the right to buy the remaining interests in CapGrow Member from Sculptor RE Holdings XVII LLC Seller by January 3, 2025 at a price (i) for the first 12 months following the initial sale to the Company, that is based on a 6.5 capitalization rate on net operating income excluding corporate general and administrative expenses pre-corporate G A NOI calculated at the time of the subsequent purchase; and (ii) for the second year following the initial sale to the Company, that is equal to a 6.0 capitalization rate on pre-corporate G A NOI calculated at the time of purchase. As the managing member of CapGrow Member, the Company has near absolute control over CapGrow, including the ability at all times on or after the initial sale to the Company to force a sale of CapGrow Member, its interest in CapGrow or 100 of CapGrow itself. However, if the Company has not exercised its option to acquire a 100 ownership interest in CapGrow Member within 24 months of the initial sale to the Company (i.e., by January 3, 2025), then Seller can also force a sale of CapGrow Member, its interest in CapGrow or 100 of CapGrow. The Company s affiliate transaction committee, which is comprised solely of the Company s independent directors, approved the Company s purchase of additional ownership interests in one or more transactions (no more than once monthly) until January 3, 2024 in CapGrow Member from Seller on the previously negotiated terms as fair and reasonable to the Company.

______________________________________________________ 
 (1) Annualized base rent represents the amount of lease revenue that our portfolio would have generated in monthly contractual rent under existing leases as of September 30, 2024 multiplied by 12. The Company had not entered into any tenant concessions or rent abatements as of September 30, 2024. Amount excludes tenant recoveries, straight-line rent, and above-market and below-market lease amortization. 

Tenant Concentration in CapGrow 
 
 While CapGrow currently leases properties to 40 different care providers, there are 4 that each represent more than 5 of CapGrow s annual rent, and collectively, the leases on the properties with these tenants contribute over 57 of the Company s rental income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. National Mentor Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation doing business as Sevita, is the largest home-based care provider serving individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the country. As of September 30, 2024, there are 44 separate subsidiaries of Sevita that have leased 506 of CapGrow s properties and there are no cross-default provisions among these leases. Such leases in aggregate represent approximately 40 of the Company s rental income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 39 of the Company's total assets as of September 30, 2024. Although Sevita is not a party to these leases, Sevita has entered into separate guarantees with respect to leases by its subsidiaries for 428 of CapGrow s properties, which represents approximately 34 of the Company s rental income and 33 of the Company s total assets as of September 30, 2024. Accordingly, Sevita has guaranteed a significant concentration of our revenue. Sufficiently adverse developments with respect to the business of such subsidiaries and/or Sevita that result in them not able to honor their lease obligations and that Sevita could not honor its many separate guarantees would likely have a greater adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition than would otherwise be the case without this concentration risk. Although Sevita reportedly sold a 25 stake in itself in 2022 at a price reflecting a 3 billion valuation, several factors may negatively impact the financial condition of Sevita, as well as the other providers who lease our properties: (i) inflationary pressures in a tight labor market and overall higher property operating expenses, (ii) higher interest expenses, (iii) increases in real estate taxes to offset state and local government revenue shortfalls, (iv) increased insurance expenses in high risk markets and for higher property replacement costs, and (v) potentially lower reimbursement rates from government payers (primarily Medicaid) due to budgetary constraints. 
 
 Generally, there are individual leases on each owned property, so the risk of an individual lease expiring or otherwise being terminated would not have a significant impact on CapGrow s business or the overall revenues earned by the Company. Additionally, CapGrow has experienced a very strong lease renewal rate with its tenants renewing 83 of expiring leases cumulatively from 2012 through September 2024. When assessing the financial position of a tenant, the Company is focused on the ability of the tenant to make rental payments underlying the lease. For existing tenants, this includes their track record of making timely payments, their source of funding (e.g., Medicaid), and to a lesser extent, information that can be gleaned from a review of their financial statements. Much of the tenant credit risk is mitigated since the payor stream is principally derived through Medicaid waivers. We believe that Medicaid s involvement in the payor stream has contributed to a long-term and consistent collection record of rent payments, with CapGrow experiencing no defaults by any of our four largest tenants. Moreover, even if a default occurred, CapGrow s experience suggests that states would generally find a new provider for those in our homes rather than displace the residents. 

Results of Operations 
 Since the Company had no significant assets or operations prior to January 1, 2023, the Company concluded that CapGrow Member is the Predecessor and the Company is the Successor and each are defined as such. Except for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has made the distinctions in the condensed consolidated financial statements and certain note presentations, as follows: 
 
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Successor Interim Period 
 for the period from January 4, 2023 through September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Successor Interim Period 
 for the period from January 1, 2023 through January 3, 2023 (the 2023 Predecessor Interim Period 
 
 The Successor and Predecessor accounts have been presented based upon the transaction date of January 4, 2023 which resulted in a change of control and application of purchase accounting as required by Accounting Standard Codification ASC 805. As a result of the foregoing, the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Predecessor and the Successor are not comparable and are separated by a black line. 
 
 The Predecessor condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods from January 1 through January 3, 2023 should be read in conjunction with the audited Predecessor condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Rental Revenue 
 Rental revenue from property operations increased by 1.7 million from 9.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 11.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to the acquisition of University Courtyard in October 2023, which contributed 1.6 million of rental revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, rental revenue increased due to the additional asset acquisitions at CapGrow. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company acquired 10 and 7 properties, respectively, and sold 2 properties for both periods. 
 
 Other Revenue 
 
 Other revenue amounting to 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the acquisition of University Courtyard while other revenue amounting to 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the lease termination income earned by CapGrow. 
 
 39 

Property Operating Expenses 
 
 Property operating expenses increased by 1.1 million from 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the acquisition of University Courtyard, which contributed to the increase in property operating expenses of 1.1 million. 
 
 Management Fees 
 
 Management fees increased by approximately 0.1 million in both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounting to approximately 0.3 million. The increase was due to the higher net asset value of the Company, which was partly driven by appreciation of our investments as well as additional equity raised. 
 
 Performance Participation Allocation 
 
 Performance participation allocation increased by 0.6 million from 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 due to appreciation of our investments which led to a higher net asset value. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative property increased by 0.1 million from 1.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in professional fees related to audit and tax services as well as other general and administrative costs relating to the acquisition of University Courtyard. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 0.8 million from 4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of the acquisition of University Courtyard, which contributed depreciation and amortization expense of 0.5 million. 
 
 Impairment of Investments in Real Estate 
 
 Impairment of investments in real estate amounting 1.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the write down of impaired vacant assets, held for sale assets and assets sold. Impairment of investments in real estate amounting to 1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the write down of held for sale assets and assets sold. It is part of CapGrow s normal business operations to sell a property when a tenant vacates such property and there is no immediate replacement tenant expected. Impairment is evaluated at such time. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net increased by 0.5 million from 2.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the financing used to acquire University Courtyard, which contributed an additional interest expense of 0.5 million.

_____________________________________ 
 (1) These financial statements are not comparable between the Predecessor and Successor periods due to a difference in the basis of accounting between the periods; the Predecessor periods were prepared under the provisions of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, while the Successor period has been presented for the consolidated operations of SDREIT. Since SDREIT consolidates CapGrow (as it is the primary beneficiary of CapGrow Member) and accounts for this acquisition transaction as a business, SDREIT recognizes all of the tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest in CapGrow Member and CapGrow at the acquisition-date fair value. 
 
 Rental Revenue 
 
 Rental revenue from property operations increased by 5.8 million from 27.1 million during the 2023 Successor Interim Period to 32.9 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period, which was primarily due to the acquisition of University Courtyard in 2023, which contributed 4.9 million of rental revenue during the 2024 Successor Interim Period. Additionally, rental revenue increased due to the assets acquired at CapGrow. During the 2024 Successor Interim Period and 2023 Successor Interim Period, the Company acquired 20 and 18 properties, respectively, and sold 12 and 32 properties, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total number of CapGrow properties owned and leased were 1,068 properties and 1,051 properties, respectively. The average monthly rent charges for all of our assets that were acquired prior to January 1, 2022 and continue to be leased to tenants were 2,448 and 2,414 during the 2024 Successor Interim Period and 2023 Successor Interim Period respectively. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.4 million from 4.7 million during the 2023 Successor Interim Period to 6.0 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period due to an increase in professional fees related to audit and tax services as well as other general and administrative costs relating to the acquisition of University Courtyard. 
 
 Organization and Transaction Costs 
 
 Organization and transaction costs amounting to 0.3 million for the 2024 Successor Interim Period were related to the legal costs associated with the Company s ongoing offering. During the 2023 Successor Interim Period, organization and transaction costs were 2.3 million which included 0.9 million of costs related to the acquisition of CapGrow which was accounted for under the business combination as well as legal and certain costs associated with the Company s organizational activities and the ongoing offering. 
 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 
 Property operating expenses increased by 2.8 million from approximately 0.5 million during the 2023 Successor Interim Period to approximately 3.3 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period primarily due to the acquisition of University Courtyard in October 2023, which contributed to the increase in property operating expenses by 2.7 million. 
 
 Management Fees 
 
 Management fees increased by 0.3 million from 0.6 million during the 2023 Successor Interim Period to 1.0 million for the 2024 Successor Interim Period. The increase was due to the higher net asset value of the Company, which was partly driven by appreciation of our investments as well as additional equity raised. 
 
 Performance Participation Allocation 
 
 There was no significant change in performance participation allocation when comparing the 2024 Successor Interim Period to the 2023 Successor Interim Period. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 5.7 million from 12.3 million during the 2023 Successor Interim Period to 18.0 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period as a result of the acquisition of University Courtyard, which contributed depreciation and amortization expense of 5.1 million, and asset acquisitions at CapGrow. 
 
 42 

Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense, net increased by 1.3 million from 7.7 million during the 2023 Successor Interim Period to 9.1 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period due to the financing used to acquire University Courtyard, which contributed additional interest expense of 1.4 million, partially offset by the interest income earned from our money market funds. 
 
 Impairment of Investments in Real Estate 
 
 Impairment of investments in real estate amounting 2.0 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period and 3.9 million during the 2023 Successor Interim Period was due to the write down of impaired vacant assets, held for sale assets and assets sold. It is part of CapGrow s normal business operations to sell a property when a tenant vacates such property and there is no immediate replacement tenant is expected. Impairment is evaluated at such time. 
 
 Unrealized gain on derivative 
 
 Unrealized gain on derivative for the 2024 Successor Interim Period pertained to University Courtyard s fair value adjustments relating to its interest rate cap. 
 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate 
 
 Gain on sale of real estate for the 2024 Successor Interim Period pertained to one property sold. 

Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations and Funds Available for Distribution 
 
 Funds from operations FFO is an operating measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT that is broadly used in the REIT industry. FFO, as defined by NAREIT and presented below, is calculated as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) impairment of investments in real estate, (iii) net gains or losses from sales of real estate, and (iv) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. We believe FFO is a meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of our operating results. Our condensed consolidated financial statements are presented using historical cost accounting which, among other things, requires depreciation of real estate investments to be calculated on a straight-line basis. As a result, our operating results imply that the value of our real estate investments have decreased over time. However, we believe that the value of our real estate investments will fluctuate over time based on market conditions and, as such, depreciation under historical cost accounting may be less informative as a measure of our performance. 
 
 We also believe that adjusted FFO AFFO is an additional meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of our operating results. AFFO further adjusts FFO to reflect the performance of our portfolio by adjusting for items we believe are not directly attributable to our operations. Our adjustments to FFO to arrive at AFFO include removing the impact of (i) straight-line rental income and expense, (ii) deferred income amortization, (iii) amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, (iv) amortization of mortgage premium/discount, (v) unrealized gains or losses from changes in the fair value of real estate debt and other financial instruments, (vi) gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translations, (vii) non-cash performance participation allocation paid in shares or Operating Partnership units, even if repurchased by us, (viii) amortization of restricted stock awards, (ix) non-cash interest expense on affiliate line of credit paid in shares or Operating Partnership units, even if subsequently repurchased by us, (x) organizational costs, (xi) amortization of deferred financing costs, and (xii) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. 
 
 We also believe that funds available for distribution FAD is an additional meaningful non-GAAP supplemental measure of our operating results. FAD provides useful information for considering our operating results and certain other items relative to the amount of our distributions. Further, FAD is a metric, among others, that is considered by our board of directors and executive officers when determining the amount of our dividend to stockholders, and we believe is therefore meaningful to stockholders. FAD is calculated as AFFO adjusted for (i) management fees paid in shares or Operating Partnership units, even if subsequently repurchased by us, (ii) realized losses (gains) on financial instruments, (iii) recurring tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and other capital expenditures, (iv) distribution fees paid during the period, and (v) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. FAD is not indicative of cash available to fund our cash needs and does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, as FAD is adjusted for distribution fees and recurring tenant improvements, leasing commission, and other capital expenditures, which are not considered when determining cash flows from operations. Furthermore, FAD excludes (i) adjustments for working 
 43 

capital items and (ii) amortization of discounts and premiums on investments in real estate debt. Cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP would generally be adjusted for such items. 
 
 FFO, AFFO, and FAD should not be considered more relevant or accurate than GAAP net income (loss) in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO, AFFO, and FAD should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as indications of our performance or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as indications of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO, AFFO, and FAD are not intended to be used as liquidity measures indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our methodology for calculating AFFO and FAD may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and accordingly, our reported AFFO and FAD may not be comparable to the AFFO and FAD reported by other companies.

Net Asset Value 
 
 We calculate NAV per share in accordance with the valuation guidelines that have been approved by our board of directors. Our total NAV presented in the following tables includes the NAV of our Class F, Class FF, Class EE, Class AA and Class A common shares, as well as the partnership interests of the Operating Partnership held by parties other than the Company, which, in aggregate, was reduced by the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries. 
 
 We calculate NAV per share for each share class monthly. Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments (including real estate debt and other securities and real estate businesses, such as CapGrow), the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand), and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation to the Special Limited Partner, and will also include the deduction of management fees and certain organization and offering expenses (which are class-specific expenses) and any distribution fees applicable to such class of shares. Please refer to Item 9. Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters Net Asset Value Calculation and Valuation Guidelines in our Form 10 for further details on how our NAV is determined.

 The following table details the discount rate and the weighted-average capitalization rate by property type, which are the key assumptions from the valuations as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 Investment Type Discount Rate 
 Exit Capitalization Rate 
 Residential (Business) 8.0 7.0 Student Housing 8.5 6.5 
 These weighted averages of key assumptions are calculated by the Adviser using information from the appraisals that are provided by the independent valuation advisor and reviewed by our Adviser. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of our property investments. For example, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, the changes listed below would result in the following effects on our investment values at September 30, 2024: 
 
 Input Hypothetical Change Residential (Business) Student Housing Discount Rate (weighted average) 0.25 decrease 1.2 1.0 Discount Rate (weighted average) 0.25 increase (1.4) (1.0) Exit Capitalization Rate (weighted average) 0.25 decrease 3.6 4.5 Exit Capitalization Rate (weighted average) 0.25 increase (3.4) (4.0) 
 
 The following table details the contracted weighted average fixed rate mortgage rates on CapGrow s properties compared to the weighted average market rates, which are key assumptions from the debt valuations as of September 30, 2024: 
 
 Debt Type Contracted Interest Rates Market Interest Rate Fixed Rate Mortgages (weighted average) 4.51 5.90 
 
 These weighted averages of key assumptions are calculated by the Adviser using information from debt valuations that are provided by the independent valuation advisor who values our debt and are reviewed by the Adviser. A change in these assumptions would impact the calculation of the value of the debt owed by CapGrow and University Courtyard. Examples of changes in market mortgage interest rates, assuming no other changes to our September 30, 2024 debt balances, would have the following effects on the value of our debt balances. 
 
 Input Hypothetical Change Residential (Business) Student Housing Mortgage Interest Rates (weighted average) 0.25 Decrease 0.50 0.40 Mortgage Interest Rates (weighted average) 0.25 Increase (0.50) (0.40)

 265,365 
 The following details the adjustments to reconcile GAAP shareholders equity to our NAV: 
 The Adviser agreed to advance certain organization and offering costs on our behalf through March 31, 2024. Such costs will be reimbursed to the Adviser on a pro-rata basis over a 60-month period beginning March 31, 2024. Under GAAP, organization costs are expensed as incurred. For purposes of calculating NAV, such costs will be recognized as paid over the 60-month reimbursement period. 
 
 We depreciate our investments in real estate and amortize certain other assets and liabilities (i.e., above- and below-market leases, in-place lease costs and deferred commissions) in accordance with GAAP. Such depreciation and amortization is not recorded for purposes of calculating our NAV. 
 
 Our investments in real estate are presented at their depreciated cost basis in our GAAP condensed consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our mortgage loans, and revolving credit facility Debt are presented at their amortized cost basis in our GAAP condensed consolidated financial statements. As such, any increases or decreases in the fair market value of our investments in real estate or our Debt are not included in our GAAP results. For purposes of calculating our NAV, our investments in real estate and our Debt are recorded at fair value. 
 
 We recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis under GAAP. Such straight-line rent adjustments are excluded for purposes of calculating NAV. 
 
 We accrue dividends on unvested restricted stock in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of calculating our NAV, we exclude these accrued unvested dividends until the vesting period associated to the underlying restricted stock expires. 
 
 Distributions 
 Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors, in accordance with our earnings, cash flows and general financial condition. Our board of directors discretion is directed, in substantial part, by its obligation to cause us to comply with the REIT requirements. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to pay distributions sufficient to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT for tax purposes. We intend to distribute sufficient income so that we satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute 90 of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders. We intend to declare monthly distributions as authorized by our board of directors (or a committee of the board of directors) and to pay such distributions on a monthly basis. Our distribution policy is set by our board of directors and is subject to change based on available cash flows. Distributions are made on all classes of our common stock at the same time. We normally expect that the accrual of ongoing fees on a class-specific basis will result in different amounts of distributions being paid with respect to certain classes of shares. 
 
 Beginning March 31, 2023, we declared monthly distributions for each class of our common shares, which are generally paid 12 days after month-end. We have paid distributions consecutively each month since such time. Each class of our common 
 47 

shares received the same aggregate gross distribution per share, which was 0.0637 per share for the month ended September 30, 2024. The net distribution varies for each class based on the applicable distribution fee, which is deducted from the monthly distribution per share and paid directly to the applicable distributor. On October 1, 2023, Class FF shares became subject to an annual distribution fee of 0.50 per annum. Class AA shares are subject to an annual distribution fee of 0.50 per annum. 
 
 The following table details the total net distributions for each of our share class from inception through record date September 30, 2024:

 (1) 100 of our distributions to SDREIT stockholders and OP unitholders was funded by our inception to date cash flows from operating activities. 
 (2) See Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations and Funds Available for Distribution above for a description of Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations, for reconciliations of these amounts to GAAP net loss attributable to SDREIT shareholders and for considerations on how to review these metrics. 
 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we paid approximately 2.4 million of distributions in cash using cash flows from operations and approximately 0.6 million of distributions in shares under our distribution reinvestment plan. 
 
 There is no assurance we will pay distributions in any particular amount, if at all. We may fund any distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including, without limitation, the sale of or repayment of our assets, borrowings or offering proceeds, and we have no limits on the amounts we may pay from such sources. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 
 We believe we have sufficient liquidity to operate our business, with 28.5 million of immediate liquidity as of September 30, 2024, which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents. Aside from cash flows from operations, we obtain incremental liquidity through the sale of our common shares. We may incur indebtedness secured by our real estate and real estate debt investments, borrow money through unsecured financings, or incur other forms of indebtedness. We may also generate incremental liquidity through the sale of our real estate and real estate debt investments. 
 
 Our primary liquidity needs are to fund our investments, make distributions to our shareholders, repurchase common shares pursuant to our share repurchase plan, pay operating expenses, fund capital expenditures, and repay indebtedness. Our operating expenses include, among other things, the management fee we pay to the Adviser and the performance participation allocation that the Operating Partnership pays to the Special Limited Partner, both of which will impact our liquidity to the extent the Adviser or the Special Limited Partner elect to receive such payments in cash, or subsequently redeem shares or OP units previously issued to them. 
 
 Our cash needs for acquisitions and other capital investments are expected to be funded primarily from the sale of common shares and through the incurrence or assumption of debt. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from the sale of assets. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our indebtedness included loans secured by our properties, our credit facility and a financing obligation. The following table is a summary of our indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 (amount in thousands): 
 
 Indebtedness

 (3,477) Total indebtedness 
 265,367 
 ______________________________________ 
 (1) For loans where the Company, at its sole discretion, has extension options, the maximum maturity date has been assumed. 
 (2) Mortgages and other loans payable bear varying fixed rates and maturities ranging from October 2024 through February 2039. There were no extension options for any of our loans. 
 (3) The revolving credit facility bears interest equal to Term SOFR plus 3.5 per annum. The weighted average interest rate for the revolving credit facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 8.79 . The revolving credit facility provided a one-year extension option subject to an extension fee of 0.30 of the total loan commitment. In February 2024, the maturity date was extended to February 2025 as a result of the Company exercising its one-year extension option. 
 (4) This financing obligation is related to the sale and leaseback transaction of University Courtyard, which is accounted for as a failed and leaseback transaction because the lease is classified as a finance lease. Accordingly, the underlying land is still included in the investments in real estate in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds from the sale are accounted for as a financing obligation. The rental payment under the lease 
 49 

will be allocated between interest expense and principal repayment of the financing obligation using the effective interest method and amortize over the 99-yeaar lease term. The total principal payments will not exceed the difference between the gross proceeds from the sale of the 23.2 million and the initial carrying value of the land of 4.1 million, resulting in maximum principal payments of 19.1 million. 
 
 In March 2023, the Company commenced the offering of its shares through a continuous private placement offering. Except for certain direct sales of Class F shares to institutional investors, Class F and Class FF shares of our common stock are now only available to investors who had invested in such class prior to January 1, 2024 and only in limited amounts through January 1, 2025. Commencing October 1, 2023, Class A, Class AA, Class D, Class I and Class S shares became available for issuance in the offering to the extent there are subscriptions for such shares. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have received net proceeds of 96.0 million, including proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan, from selling an aggregate of 1,042,500 Class F common shares, 6,255,034 Class FF common shares, 1,698,406 Class AA shares and 50,109 Class A shares in the private Offering. This is in addition to the 150.2 million raised from the sale of 15,021,977 Class F common shares (including reinvestment of dividends) in private transactions that preceded this Offering. Additionally, we issued an aggregate 1.8 million or 163,798 of Class E common shares to our independent directors under the terms of the independent director compensation plan, our Advisor as payments of management fees and to an employee of Sculptor who purchased such shares.

 Cash flows used in investing activities decreased by approximately 128.7 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period primarily due to the acquisition of the 61.64 controlling interest in CapGrow in January 2023. 
 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by approximately 32.3 million during the 2024 Successor Interim Period primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from stock issuances and increased distributions to stockholders partially offset by a decrease in portfolio level borrowings.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, we were not involved in any material legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act as described below. As described in Note 10, Related Party Transactions, to our condensed consolidated financial statements, the Advisor may elect to receive its management fee in cash, shares of our Class E common stock, or Class E units of the Operating Partnership. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Adviser elected to receive its management fees in Class E shares and we issued 30,048 unregistered Class E shares to the Adviser in satisfaction of the management fees for the period from May 2024 through July 2024. Since our Adviser elected to receive Class E shares, we also issued 2,409 unregistered Class E shares to the Adviser as part of the distribution reinvestment program. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we also issued 900 Class E shares to a Sculptor employee and 1,575 unregistered Class E shares to our independent directors in connection with their participation in the distribution reinvestment plan. A portion of the shares issued to our independent directors are restricted and are subject to vesting and settlement provisions as detailed within the independent director compensation plan. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 2,356 shares of Class FF common stock, 608,163 shares of Class AA common stock and 49,950 shares of Class A common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 7.1 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 380 shares of Class F common stock, 64,377 shares of Class FF common stock, 13,317 shares of Class AA common stock and 159 shares of Class A common stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 0.8 million, as part of the distribution reinvestment program. The offer and sale of these shares were exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D and/or Regulation S thereunder. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 Under our share repurchase plan, to the extent we choose to repurchase shares in any particular month, we will only repurchase shares as of the opening of the last calendar day of that month (each such date, a Repurchase Date ). Repurchases will be made at the transaction price in effect on the Repurchase Date, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 95 of the transaction price (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The Early Repurchase Deduction may only be waived in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death or qualified disability of the holder and in other limited circumstances. The Early Repurchase Deduction will not apply to shares acquired through our distribution reinvestment plan. 
 
 The total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares of our common stock will be limited during each calendar month to 2 of the aggregate NAV of all classes as of the last calendar day of the previous quarter and in each calendar quarter will be limited to 5 of the aggregate NAV of all classes of shares as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter; provided, however, that every month and quarter each class of our common stock will be allocated capacity within such aggregate limit to allow stockholders in such class to either (a) redeem shares equal to at least 2 of the aggregate NAV of such share class as of the last calendar day of the previous quarter, or, if more limiting, (b) redeem shares over the course of a given quarter equal to at least 5 of the aggregate NAV of such share class as of the last calendar day of the previous quarter (collectively referred to herein as the 2 and 5 limits ). In the event that we repurchase some but not all of the shares submitted for repurchase during any month, shares repurchased at the end of the month will be repurchased on a pro rata basis. Repurchases and pro rata treatment, if necessary, will first be applied within the class-specific allocated capacity and 
 52 

then applied on an aggregate basis to the extent there is remaining capacity. For purposes of calculating the 2 and 5 limits, the repurchase price will be deemed to be the price before any Early Repurchase Deduction. 
 
 Should repurchase requests, in our judgment, place an undue burden on our liquidity, adversely affect our operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company, or should we otherwise determine that investing our liquid assets in real properties or other investments rather than repurchasing our shares is in the best interests of the Company, we may choose to repurchase fewer shares in any particular month than have been requested to be repurchased, or none at all. Further, our board of directors may make exceptions to, modify, suspend or terminate our share repurchase plan if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. 
 
 If the transaction price for the applicable month is not made available by the tenth business day prior to the last business day of the month (or is changed after such date), then no repurchase requests will be accepted for such month and stockholders who wish to have their shares repurchased the following month must resubmit their repurchase requests. Material modifications, including any amendment to the 2 monthly or 5 quarterly limitations on repurchases, to and suspensions of the share repurchase plan will be promptly disclosed to stockholders via their financial representatives. In addition, we may determine to suspend the share repurchase plan due to regulatory changes, changes in law or if we become aware of undisclosed material information that we believe should be publicly disclosed before shares are repurchased. Our board of directors must affirmatively authorize the recommencement of the plan if it is suspended before stockholder requests will be considered again. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not receive any repurchase requests.
