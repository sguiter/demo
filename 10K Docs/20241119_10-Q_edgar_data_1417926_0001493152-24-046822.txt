to years. The Company capitalizes the expenditures for major renewals and improvements
that extend the useful lives of property and equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by a comparison
of their carrying amounts to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its
fair market value.

and has an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. Approximately million of the net loss was
related to non-cash expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

The
Company has been dependent on raising capital from debt and equity financings to meet its needs for cash used in operating and investing
activities. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company received million from the sale of preferred stock, million from
the exercise of warrants, million in net proceeds from the sale of notes, and million in net proceeds from the sale of common
stock. Over the next 12 months, the Company s plan includes growing the Wisconsin Fertility Institute and pursuing additional IVF
clinic acquisitions. Until the Company can generate positive cash from operations, it will need to raise additional funding to meet its
liquidity needs and to execute its business strategy. As in the past, the Company will seek debt and/or equity funding, which may not
be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 

Although
the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared under the
assumption that it would continue operations as a going concern, the report of the Company s independent registered public
accounting firm that accompanies the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a going
concern qualification in which such firm expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern, based on the financial statements at that time. Specifically, as noted above, the Company has incurred significant
operating losses, and the Company expects to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses, as it continues to ramp up
the commercialization of INVOcell, develop new INVO Centers, pursue potential acquisitions of additional established IVF centers, and advance the recently acquired oncology-related assets of Legacy NAYA. These prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will
continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. If the Company cannot continue as a going concern,
its stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in the Company. 

,
of which 
was paid on the closing date (net cash paid was 
after a 
holdback) plus assumption of the inter-company loan owed by WFRSA (as defined below) in the amount of .
The remaining three installments of 
each will be within ninety (90) days of the subsequent three anniversaries of closing. The sellers have the option to take all or a
portion of the final three installments in shares of the Company s common stock at a per share value of ,
 ,
and ,
for the second, third, and final installments, respectively. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not made the second installment payment for WFI. The Company and the
sellers are still negotiating the amount of the post-closing purchase price adjustments, which impacts the amount of the second installment
payment. 

WFI
was comprised of (a) a medical practice, Wisconsin Fertility and Reproductive Surgery Associates, S.C., a Wisconsin professional service
corporation d/b/a Wisconsin Fertility Institute WFRSA ), and (b) a laboratory services company, Fertility Labs of Wisconsin,
LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company FLOW ). WFRSA owned, operated, and managed WFI s fertility practice that
provided direct treatment to patients focused on fertility, gynecology, and obstetrics care and surgical procedures, and employed physicians
and other healthcare providers to deliver such services and procedures. FLOW provided WFRSA with related laboratory services. 

The Company
purchased the non-medical assets of WFRSA and one hundred percent of FLOW s membership interests through Wood Violet. Concurrently,
Wood Violet and WFRSA entered into a management services agreement pursuant to which WFRSA outsourced all its non-medical activities
to Wood Violet. As a result, post-closing, WFI is comprised of (a) WFRSA, which only employs physicians to provide medical services,
and (b) Wood Violet, which employs all other clinic personnel and provides all non-medical services, including laboratory services. FLOW
is no longer operational as its operations were absorbed by Wood Violet. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include WFI s results of operations.
The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the final purchase accounting adjustments in accordance with
ASC 805 Business Combinations , whereby the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

within the 24-month period following the execution of the Bloom
Agreement to support the start-up operations of the Georgia JV, the Georgia JV issued of its units to INVO CTR and in consideration
for Bloom s commitment to contribute physician services having an anticipated value of up to over the course of a 24-month
vesting period, the Georgia JV issued of its units to Bloom. 

The
responsibilities of Bloom include providing all medical services required for the operation of the Atlanta Clinic. The responsibilities
of INVO CTR include providing certain funding to the Georgia JV, lab services quality management, and providing access to and being the
exclusive provider of the INVOcell to the Georgia JV. INVO CTR also performs all required, industry specific compliance and accreditation
functions, and product documentation for product registration. 

The
Bloom Agreement provides Bloom with a profits interest in the Georgia JV and, in connection with such profits interest,
states that profits and losses be allocated to its members based on a hypothetical liquidation of the Georgia JV. In such a scenario,
liquidation proceeds would be distributed in the following order: (a) to INVO CTR until the difference between its capital contributions
and distributions equals ; (b) to Bloom until its distributions equal of the liquidation amounts distributed to INVO CTR (a catch-up 
to rebalance the distributions between members); and (c) thereafter on a pro rata basis. The Georgia JV had no assets or liabilities
at the time the units were issued, and, as of September 30, 2024, INVO CTR had made capital contributions greater than the net loss of
the Georgia JV. As such, the entire net loss was allocated to INVO CTR, and no loss was allocated to the noncontrolling interest of Bloom. 

The
Atlanta Clinic opened to patients on September 7, 2021. 

The
Company determined the Georgia JV is a VIE, and that the Company is its primary beneficiary because the Company has an obligation to
absorb losses that are potentially significant and the Company controls the majority of the activities that impact the Georgia JV s
economic performance, specifically control of the INVOcell and lab services quality management. As a result, the Company consolidated
the Georgia JV s results with its own. As of September 30, 2024, the Company invested million in the Georgia JV in the form
of capital contributions as well as million in the form of a note. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Georgia

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements
and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, this discussion
and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially
from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified
below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023 as may be amended, supplemented, or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 

Throughout
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to we, our, us, the Company, NAYA, 
or NAYA Biosciences, Inc. refer to NAYA Biosciences, Inc. a Nevada corporation formerly known as INVO Bioscience, Inc. 

Overview 

We
are a life science portfolio company dedicated to bringing breakthrough treatments to patients in oncology, autoimmune diseases, and
fertility. Our hub and spoke model harnesses the shared resources of a parent company and agility of lean strategic franchises,
enabling efficient acquisition, development, and partnering of assets as well as optimized return on investment by combining the
upside of innovative clinical-stage therapeutics with scalable, profitable commercial revenues. 

Our principal operations are focused
currently in two divisions: NAYA Fertility and NAYA Therapeutics. NAYA Fertility s clinical services are carried out primarily via
its INVO Centers, LLC wholly owned subsidiary, which owns all NAYA fertility clinics. The INVOcell is distributed directly by NAYA. NAYA
Therapeutics, Inc. (also referred to herein as Legacy NAYA carries out our current activities in oncology
and autoimmune diseases. 

Our
expanding portfolio of assets currently includes NY-303, a GPC3 and NKp46 targeting bispecific antibody for the treatment of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) with a unique mode of action targeting non-responders to the current immunotherapy standard of care (approximately 70 
of the current treatable market) cleared to enroll patients in a Phase I/II monotherapy trial in early 2025, NY-338, a CD38 and NKp46
targeting bispecific antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases with a differentiated safety and efficacy
profile, and INVOcell , an FDA-approved fertility device which has demonstrated comparable success rates to traditional in vitro
fertilization IVF ). 

NAYA
Fertility 

Our
commercial strategy for the fertility business is primarily focused on operating fertility-focused clinics, which include the opening
of INVO Centers dedicated primarily to offering the intravaginal culture IVC procedure enabled by our INVOcell 
medical device INVOcell and the acquisition of US-based, profitable in vitro fertilization IVF clinics.
As of the date of this filing, we have two operational INVO Centers in the United States and completed our first IVF clinic acquisition
in August 2023. We also continue to engage in the sale and distribution of our INVOcell technology solution into existing independently
owned and operated fertility clinics. 

INVO
Centers: 

On
March 10 and June 28, 2021, we established joint ventures to open INVO Centers in Birmingham, Alabama, and Atlanta, Georgia, respectively.
We established these clinics to increase use volume for the INVOcell, accelerating the growth and awareness of the IVC procedure and
the availability of statistical data supporting its use. These clinics also enabled us to expand our revenue from several hundred dollars
per INVOcell to thousands of dollars for each fertility cycle, and to significantly advance our path to profitability. INVO Centers require
less investment than traditional IVF clinics and are operationally efficient, making them ideal for underserved secondary markets. We
plan on opening additional INVO Centers in the coming years and such clinics will be wholly owned. 

34 

Acquisitions: 

On
August 10, 2023, we consummated the first acquisition of an existing IVF clinic, the Wisconsin Fertility Institute WFI ).
As an established and profitable clinic, the closing of the WFI acquisition more than tripled our current annual revenues and became
a major part of our clinic-based operations. The acquisition accelerates the transformation of NAYA to a healthcare services company
and immediately added scale and positive cash flow to the operations. It also complements our existing new-build INVO Center efforts.
We expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions of established and profitable existing fertility clinics as part of our ongoing
strategy to accelerate overall growth. 

INVOcell: 

Our
proprietary technology, INVOcell , is a revolutionary medical device that allows fertilization and early embryo development to take
place in vivo within the woman s body. This treatment solution is the world s first intravaginal culture technique for the
incubation of oocytes and sperm during fertilization and early embryo development and provides patients with a more natural, intimate,
and affordable experience in comparison to other assisted reproductive technology ART treatments. We believe the IVC
procedure can deliver comparable results at a lower cost than traditional IVF and is a significantly more effective treatment than intrauterine
insemination IUI ). 

Unlike
IVF, where the oocytes and sperm develop into embryos in an expensive laboratory incubator, the INVOcell allows fertilization and early
embryo development to take place in the woman s body. This allows for many benefits in the IVC procedure, including the following: 

Reduces
 expensive and time-consuming lab procedures, helping clinics and doctors to increase patient capacity and reduce costs; 

Provides
 a natural, stable incubation environment; 

Offers
 a more personal, intimate experience in creating a baby; and 

Reduces
 the risk of errors and wrong embryo transfers. 

In
both current utilization of the INVOcell, and in clinical studies, the IVC procedure has demonstrated equivalent pregnancy success and
live birth rates as IVF. 

While
INVOcell remains part of our efforts, our commercial and corporate development strategy has expanded to focus more broadly on providing
ART services through our emphasis on operating clinics. 

35 

NAYA
Therapeutics 

NAYA
Therapeutics is developing and aiming to achieve clinical proof-of-concept for its two NK engager bispecific antibodies for the
treatment of select cancers and autoimmune diseases. We are currently preparing the initiation of a Phase I dose escalation
clinical trial for NY-303, our lead GPC3-targeting NK engager bispecific antibody for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and
other solid tumors, pending approval from regulatory authorities and hospital internal review boards. Clinical trials for NY-338,
our lead CD38-targeting NK engager bispecific antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases, are expected
to initiate in 2025. 

Pipeline 

Our
initial pipeline includes two novel Flex-NK bispecific antibodies acquired from Cytovia Therapeutics, Inc. The first is NY-303,
which targets a protein expressed on the cell membrane of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC ), called GPC3, and other solid
tumors, while predominantly absent in normal tissue, making it a promising new therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC and other
solid tumors. The second is NY-338, for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma and other autoimmune diseases. These FLEX-NK bispecific
antibodies are built on a quadrivalent multifunctional antibody platform designed to engage natural killer cells NK Cells by targeting NKp46 activating receptors using Cytovia s proprietary Flex-NK technology. Both NY-303 and NY-338 are expecting
to file two investigational new drug applications in 2024 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and initiate two Phase 1 Dose Escalation
clinical trials to target HCC type of liver cancer, in the middle of 2024 and with a final data in 2025. 

Key
elements of our strategy include: 

Advancing
 NY-303, our GPC3-targeting FLEX NK bispecific antibody candidate for HCC and other solid tumors, into Phase i/ii clinical
 trials and towards clinical proof of concept; 

Advancing
 NY-338, our CD38-targeting FLEX-NK bispecific antibody candidate for Multiple Myeloma into Phase i/iia clinical trials and
 towards clinical proof of concept; 

Evaluate
 differentiated profile of NY-338 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases include SLE 
 Lupus Nephritis and advance it into clinical development upon preclinical proof of concept; 

Acquire
 for further development a clinical asset with phase 1/ 2 data from a large pharma, biotech
 or international company; and 

Entering
 into revenue-generating development partnerships with larger pharmaceutical/biotech companies upon achieving clinical milestones. 

36 

Operations 

Our
most critical management and leadership functions are carried out by our core management team. Each clinic is separately staffed with
clinical staff necessary to manage daily activities, while most administrative tasks are centralized and handled by NAYA staff. With
respect to the INVOcell device, we have contracted out the manufacturing, assembly, packaging, and labeling to a medical manufacturing
company, sterilization of the device to a sterilization specialist, and storage and shipping to a third part logistics company. 

To
date, we have completed a series of important steps in the successful development and manufacturing of the INVOcell: 

Manufacturing :
 We are ISO 13485:2016 certified and manage all aspects of production and manufacturing with qualified suppliers. Our key suppliers,
 which include NextPhase Medical Devices and Casco Bay Molding, have been steadfast partners since our company first began and can
 provide us with virtually an unlimited capability to support our growth objectives, with all manufacturing performed in the New England
 region of the U.S. 

Raw
 Materials : All raw materials utilized for the INVOcell are medical grade and commonly used in medical devices (e.g., medical
 grade silicone, medical grade plastic). Our principal molded component suppliers, Casco Bay Molding and R.E.C. Manufacturing Corporation,
 are well-established companies in the molding industry and are either ISO 13485 or ISO 9001 certified. The molded components are
 supplied to our contract manufacturer for assembly and packaging of the INVOcell system. The contract manufacturer is ISO 13485 certified,
 and U.S. Food Drug Administration FDA registered. 

US
 Marketing Clearance : The safety and efficacy of the INVOcell has been demonstrated and cleared for marketing and use by the FDA
 in November 2015. 

Clinical :
 In June 2023, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to expand the labeling on the INVOcell device and its indication for use to provide
 for a 5-day incubation period. The data supporting the expanded 5-day incubation clearance demonstrated improved patient outcomes. 

Market
Opportunity 

NAYA
Fertility 

The
global ART marketplace is a large, multi-billion dollar industry growing at a strong pace in many parts of the world as increased infertility
rates, increased patient awareness, acceptance of treatment options, and improving financial incentives such as insurance and governmental
assistance continue to drive demand. According to the European Society for Human Reproduction 2020 ART Fact Sheet, one in six couples
worldwide experience infertility problems. Additionally, the worldwide market remains vastly underserved as a high percentage of patients
in need of care continue to go untreated each year for many reasons, but key among them are capacity constraints and cost barriers. While
there have been large increases in the use of IVF, there are still only an estimated 2.6 million ART cycles, including IVF, IUI, and
other fertility treatments, performed globally each year, producing around 500,000 babies. This amounts to less than 3 of the infertile
couples worldwide being treated and only 1 having a child though IVF. The industry remains capacity constrained which creates challenges
in providing access to care to the volume of patients in need and at an affordable price. A survey by Resolve: The National Infertility
Association, indicates the two main reasons couples do not use IVF is cost and geographical availability (and/or capacity). 

37 

In
the United States, infertility affects an estimated 10 -15 of the couples of childbearing-age, according to the American Society of
Reproductive Medicine (2017). According to the Centers for Disease Control CDC ), there are approximately 6.7 million women
with impaired fertility. Based on 2021 data from CDC s National ART Surveillance System, approximately 413,000 IVF cycles were
performed at 453 IVF centers, leaving the U.S. with a large, underserved patient population, similar to most markets around the world. 

Our
INVO Center strategy is aimed at taking advantage of the fertility market s imbalance between supply and demand. We have has identified
over 50 suitable locations in the United States alone with attractive demographics and fertility service levels that would be ideal for
new INVO Centers. 

We
also expect to expand our operations with an acquisition strategy. We estimate that there are approximately 80 to 100 established owner-operated
IVF clinics that may represent suitable acquisitions as part of this additional effort. 

NAYA
Therapeutics 

According
to a Delveinsight July 2023 report on the Multiple Myeloma, the global market size in 2022 for Multiple Myeloma treatments was 20 billion
and is expected to continue to grow significantly with the introduction of new products. The current market leader, CD38 targeting monoclonal
antibody, Darzalex (daratumumab) reached 8 billion in global sales in 2022. 

Recently
the FDA approved bi-specific antibodies, including BCMA targeting CARVYKTI , TECVAYLI in 2022 and GPRC5D targeting Talvey
in 2023 from Johnson Johnson. The new BCMA targeting bispecific antibody from Pfizer, Elrexfio, was approved in August 2023. Additional
bispecific antibodies from Abbvie, Regeneron and Roche are in early stage of clinical development. However, despite this existing competition,
NY-338, is to the best of our knowledge, the first CD38-targeting NK engager to enter clinical trials. 

Additional
bispecific antibodies from Abbvie, Regeneron and Roche are in early stage of clinical development. However, NAYA s NY-338 is the
first bispecific antibody to target both NKp46 to redirect NK cells and CD38, with the potential to demonstrate both efficacy and safety
advantages. 

There
are several other GPC3-targeting antibodies or cell therapies are being developed by AstraZeneca, Takeda, Legend Biotech, and Adicet
Bio in collaboration with Regeneron. However, we aim to differentiate ourselves from the aforementioned companies as the first company
to enter clinic trials with a GPC3 targeting NK engager bispecific antibody. 

According
to Polaris Market Research, the market size for liver cancer treatment was 2.44 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow a compounded
annual growth rate of 20 to reach 10.48 billion in 2030. Market growth is supported by increased incidence and the 2022 approval of
new standard of care, Merck s Keytruda and a combination of two biological drugs commercialized by Genentech Roche, Telecentriq
and Avastatin.

our commercial efforts have expanded to clinic services within the ART market, we also continue to believe that our INVOcell device,
and the IVC procedure it enables, have the following key advantages: 

Lower
cost than IVF with equivalent efficacy. The IVC procedure can be offered for less than IVF due to lower cost of supplies, labor,
capital equipment and general overhead. The laboratory equipment needed to perform an IVF cycle is expensive and requires ongoing costs
as compared to what is required for an IVC cycle. As a result, we also believe INVOcell and the IVC procedure enable a clinic and its
laboratory to be more efficient as compared to conventional IVF. 

The
IVC procedure is currently being offered at several IVF clinics at a price range of 5,000 - 11,000 per cycle and from 4,500 to 7,000
at the existing INVO Centers, thereby making it more affordable than IVF (which tends to average 11,000 to 15,000 per cycle or higher). 

Improved
efficiency providing for greater capacity and improved access to care and geographic availability . In many parts of the world, including
the U.S., IVF clinics tend to be concentrated in higher population centers and are often capacity constrained in terms of how many patients
a center can treat, since volume is limited by the number of capital-intensive incubators available in IVF clinic labs. With the significant
number of untreated patients along with the growing interest and demand for services, the industry remains challenged to provide sufficient
access to care and to do so at an economical price. We believe INVOcell and the IVC procedure it enables can play an important role in
helping to address these challenges. We estimate that by adopting the INVOcell, IVF clinics can increase fertility cycle volume by up
to 30 without adding to personnel, space and/or equipment costs. Our own INVO Centers also address capacity constraints by adding to
the overall ART cycle capacity and doing so with comparable efficacy to IVF outcomes as well as at a lower per cycle price. Moreover,
we believe that we are uniquely positioned to drive more significant growth in fertility treatment capacity in the future by partnering
with existing OB/GYN practices. With our three-pronged strategy (IVF clinics, INVO Centers and OB/GYN practices), in addition to lowering
costs, we believe INVOcell and the IVC procedure can address the industry s key challenges, capacity and cost, and help open up
access to care for underserved patients around the world. 

38 

Greater
patient involvement . With the IVC procedure, the patient uses their own body for fertilization, incubation, and early embryo development
which creates a greater sense of involvement, comfort, and participation. In some cases, this may also free people from barriers related
to ethical or religious concerns, or fears of laboratory mix-ups. 

INVOcell
Sales and Marketing 

While
we will continue to sell the INVOcell directly to IVF clinics and via distributors and other partners around the world, we have transitioned
NAYA from being a medical device company to one that is primarily focused on providing fertility services. Our approach to marketing
INVOcell is focused on identifying partners within targeted geographic regions that we believe can best support our efforts to expand
access to advanced fertility treatment for the large number of underserved infertile people. We have been cleared to sell the INVOcell
in the United States since November 2015 after receiving de novo class II clearance from the FDA, and we received an additional FDA clearance
in 2023 for expanded usage of the device. 

International
Distribution Agreements 

We
have entered into exclusive distribution agreements for a number of international markets. These agreements usually have an initial term
with renewal options and require the distributors to meet minimum annual purchases, which vary depending on the market. We are also required
to register the product in each market before the distributor can begin importing, a process and timeline that can vary widely depending
on the market.

Supplement and the Base Registration Statement remaining effective. 

The
Triton Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants by each of the NAYA and Triton. Actual sales
of shares of common stock to Triton will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others,
market conditions, the trading price of the common stock, and determinations by us as to the appropriate sources of funding for NAYA

shares of common stock from us from time to time, pursuant to directions from us, in accordance with the Triton Purchase Agreement. During
the term of the Triton Purchase Agreement, Triton has covenanted not to cause or engage in any short selling of shares of common stock. 

On

On
March 27, 2024, we delivered a purchase notice for 260,000 shares of common stock. Our common stock traded below the purchase price following

Nasdaq
Compliance Minimum Equity Requirement 

On
April 17, 2024, NAYA, having reported, on April 16, 2024, stockholders equity of 892,825 in the Form 10-K for the period ended
December 31, 2023, received notice (the Notice from the staff (the Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq advising us that we no longer complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) that requires companies listed on The
Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders equity of at least 2,500,000 (the Equity Rule ). 

In
a decision dated November 22, 2023, a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel previously had confirmed that we regained
compliance with the Equity Rule. In the decision, the Panel imposed a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year or until
November 22, 2024, which would require Staff to issue a Delist Determination Letter, in the event that we failed to maintain
compliance with the Equity Rule (the Panel Monitor ). As a result, the Notice contained the Staff s determination
to delist NAYA from Nasdaq. 

As
described in the Notice, under Nasdaq rules, we had the right to request an appeal of this determination to prevent its securities
from being delisted and suspended at the opening of business on April 26, 2024. We exercised this right, and our hearing to present
its appeal of the Staff s determination in front of the Panel was heard on June 6, 2024. 

On
June 18, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that the Panel had granted our request for continued listing on the Exchange
until October 14, 2024, subject to our demonstrating compliance with Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5505 (the Initial Listing
Rule ), as it would apply to the proposed Merger with Legacy NAYA. The Initial Listing Rule requires us to have a minimum bid
price, a minimum of unrestricted publicly held shares, a minimum number of round lot shareholders, a minimum number of market
makers, and it requires us to meet its Equity Standard, its Market Value of Listed Securities Standard, or its Net Income
Standard. 

On October 11, 2024, we consummated the acquisition of Legacy NAYA pursuant to the Merger. The closing of the Merger
resulted in an increase in our stockholders equity of approximately 16,000,000, which we believed was sufficient to evidence compliance
with the Nasdaq listing criteria and to maintain its listing on Nasdaq. 

On
November 4, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq, dated October 30, 2024, informing us that we demonstrated compliance
with the Equity Rule for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as required by the Panel s decision dated June 18, 2024,
as amended. We will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor for a period of one year from the date of the notification. 

Nasdaq
Compliance Minimum Bid Price 

On
September 18, 2024, we received a letter from the staff of the Nasdaq listing qualifications group indicating that, based upon
the closing bid price of our common stock for the last 34 consecutive business days, we are not currently in
compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

The
notice has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq. 

In
accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until May
17, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If at any time before May 17, 2025, the closing bid price of our common stock closes at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written
notification that we have achieved compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, and the matter would be resolved. If we do not regain compliance prior to May 17, 2025, then Nasdaq may grant us a second 180 calendar day period to regain
compliance, provided we (i) meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly-held shares and all other initial
listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, other than the minimum closing bid price requirement, and (ii) notifiy Nasdaq of its
intent to cure the deficiency within such second 180 calendar day period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. 

51 

We have agreed to prepare and file a proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC to be used
for a stockholder meeting of NAYA to seek, among other things, ratification of the Merger, an increase in the amount of authorized
shares under the Company s stock incentive plan, the issuance of shares of the Company s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company s Series
C-1 Preferred and Series C-2 Preferred, an increase in the number of shares of the Company s authorized common
stock to 100,000,000 shares, and approval to effectuate a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock at a ratio ranging from any
whole number between 1-for-2 and 1-for-20, as determined by the Company s board of directors in its discretion. 

We will continue to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and will consider implementing available options to regain
compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. If we do not regain compliance with the
minimum bid price requirement within the allotted compliance periods, we will receive a written notification from Nasdaq that
its securities are subject to delisting. We would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel.
There can be no assurance that we will regain compliance during either compliance period, or maintain compliance with the other
Nasdaq listing requirements 

Results
of Operations 

During
the first three quarters of 2024, the benefits of our effort to transition NAYA s fertility operations towards healthcare
services through our ownership of fertility clinics became increasingly evident as our revenue increased compared to last
year. This was primarily enabled by our first acquisition (in August of 2023) of an existing IVF practice. This Madison, Wisconsin
based fertility center was established more than 15 years ago, generates strong revenue and profits, and provided an immediate and
substantial impact to our overall operations as reflected in our significant growth in the first half of this year. We also believe
this first acquisition provides a road map and foundation for us to utilize in the pursuit of additional acquisitions of established
and profitable small IVF practices. Subject to terms and acquisition capital availability, we anticipate actively pursuing suitable
acquisition targets to further accelerate our growth objectives. 

Our
existing operational INVO Centers located in Alabama and Georgia experienced some modest disruption with the shift in federal abortion laws, but as the market adjusts to the new dynamic of individual states rules we anticipate both will continue to make further
advances in the current year. Due to international resource constraints and the lack of an available local physician resource, the Mexico
clinic has halted providing services. We continue to seek additional U.S. opportunities to expand our INVO Center activities over time,
and, in the short-term, expect to devote more of our efforts toward acquisitions as we believe they would enable us to build scale in
our operations at a quicker space, and, in turn, help support our long-term objective of building INVO centers across the U.S. market. 

Although
our clinic operations make up most of our commercial efforts and revenue, we also continue to work on providing the INVOcell to third
party fertility clinics. 

We
believe the overall industry trends remain favorable and will help support our growth objectives. The ART market continues to benefit
from a number of tailwinds, including (1) the large under-served potential patient population, (2) increasing infertility rates around
the world, (3) growing awareness and education of fertility treatment options, (4) a growing acceptance of fertility treatment, (5) improvements
in procedure techniques and hence improvements in pregnancy success rates, and (6) generally improving insurance (private and public)
reimbursement trends. 

Additionally
on October 11, 2024 we consummated the acquisition of Legacy NAYA, which represents a major step toward furthering our efforts to
expand our focus into oncology and autoimmune diseases. With this completed acquisition we plan to leverage our existing
fertility platform with Legacy NAYA s clinical stage therapeutics to develop and build a group of agile, disruptive,
high-growth business segments dedicated to increasing patient access to life-transforming treatments in the areas of oncology,
fertility, and regenerative medicine.

have been dependent on raising capital from debt and equity financings to meet our needs for cash required to fund our operating expenses
and investing activities. During the first nine months of 2024, we received net proceeds of 1.6 million for the sale of our preferred
stock, 0.9 million from the exercise of warrants, 0.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of notes payable, and 0.2 million in net
proceeds for the sale of our common stock. During the first nine months of 2023, we received approximately 5.7 million for the sale
of common stock and 3.2 million in proceeds from the sale of convertible notes. Until we can generate positive cash from operations,
we will need to raise additional funding to meet our liquidity needs and to execute our business strategy. As in the past, we will seek
debt and/or equity financing, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. 

Although
our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared under the assumption that we would
continue operations as a going concern, the report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a going concern qualification in which such firm
expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, based on the consolidated financial statements at that
time. Specifically, as noted above, we have incurred significant operating losses and we expect to continue to incur significant
expenses and operating losses as we continue to acquire existing IVF clinics, develop the commercialization of our INVOcell solution
and proceed with clinical trials of our newly acquired therapeutics. Prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will
continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders would
likely lose most or all of their investment in us. 

Cash
Flows 

The
following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

2024

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 0.5 million in cash, compared to approximately 1.1 million as of September 30, 2023. Net
cash used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 was approximately 2.4 million, compared to approximately 4.0 million
for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the decrease in net loss. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities of 30 thousand was primarily related to the purchase of
equipment for WFI. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities of 2.5 million was primarily related
to the acquisition of WFI. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities of approximately 2.6 million was comprised of 1.6 million
in proceeds from the sale of Series A Preferred Stock, 0.9 million in proceeds from warrant exercises, net proceeds of 0.7 million
from the sale of notes payable, and net proceeds of 0.2 million from the sale of common stock. During the nine months ended September
30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities of approximately 7.5 million was primarily related to the sale of common stock, net
of offering costs, and convertible notes. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition presented in this section is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. During the preparation of
the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate, based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, our results, which allows us to form a basis
for making judgments on the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates based on variance with our assumptions and conditions. A summary of significant accounting policies is
included below. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable
financial information about our operating results and financial condition. 

54 

See
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of significant
accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements. 

Stock
Based Compensation 

We
account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718 -10 Share-Based Payment (formerly SFAS 123R). This statement
requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the period in which the employee is required to provide service or performance
goals in exchange for the award, which is usually immediate but sometimes over a vesting period. Warrants granted to non-employees are
recorded as an expense over the requisite service period based on the grant date and the estimated fair value of the grant, which is
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of ASC 606 is
to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services ASC 606 requires companies to assess their contracts to determine the timing
and amount of revenue to recognize under the new revenue standard. The model has a five-step approach: 

1. 
 Identify
 the contract with the customer. 

2. 
 Identify
 the performance obligations in the contract. 

3. 
 Determine
 the total transaction price. 

4. 
 Allocate
 the total transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract. 

5. 
 Recognize
 as revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. 

Variable
Interest Entities 

Our
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NAYA, its wholly owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities VIE ),
where we are the primary beneficiary under the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ). A VIE must be consolidated
by its primary beneficiary when, along with its affiliates and agents, the primary beneficiary has both (i) the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We reconsider whether an entity is still a VIE only upon certain
triggering events and continually assess our consolidated VIEs to determine if we continue to be the primary beneficiary. 

Equity
Method Investments 

Investments
in unconsolidated affiliates in which we exert significant influence but do not control or otherwise consolidate are accounted for using
the equity method. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost. These investments are included in investment in joint ventures
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the profits and losses from these investments is reported in loss from
equity method investment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Management monitors our investments for other-than-temporary
impairment by considering factors such as current economic and market conditions and the operating performance of the investees and records
reductions in carrying values when necessary. 

Business
Acquisitions 

We
account for all business acquisitions at fair value and expenses acquisition costs as they are incurred. Any identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are recognized and measured at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. If information about facts
and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete at the end of the reporting period in which a business acquisition
occurs, we will report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement period ends once we
receive sufficient information to finalize the fair values; however, the period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Any
adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which
the adjustment amounts are determined. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective or Adopted 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact
on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. 

55 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of September 30, 2024.

were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
