The Cooperative establishes an allowance for credit losses on
debt securities where the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis to
the extent the unrealized loss is due to credit losses. The expected credit
losses are presented as loss on investments in the accompanying statement of
operations. The Cooperative s process for establishing the allowance for credit
losses considers the risk characteristics of the security class. To the extent
possible, losses are estimated collectively for classes of securities with
similar risk characteristics. For securities that do not share similar risk
characteristics with others, the losses are estimated individually. For
available-for-sale debt securities, losses are estimated at the individual
security level. The Cooperative s allowance for credit losses are influenced by
a variety of factors, including portfolio credit quality and general economic
conditions. General economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables
which will create volatility as those variables change over time. The
Cooperative s allowance for credit losses on it s held to maturity securities
and its available for sale securities was not significant as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023. The Cooperative did not recognize any credit losses
on its held to maturity securities and available for sale securities for the
periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 . 
 In May of 2024, the Cooperative received a payment for the
 balance of assets from the fund after the purchase of the annuity and other
 expenses in the amount of . In August of 2024,, the Cooperative paid an
 excise tax in the amount of to the IRS when Form 5330 Return of Excise
 Taxes Related to Employee Benefit Plans was filed. On August 6, 2024, the
 Cooperative received notice that the IRS approved the termination of the pension fund. 

Identify Contracts with Customers 
 Annually, the Cooperative is required to deliver approximately 
 bushels of corn to Cargill for processing at the ProGold LLC wet-milling facility. To fulfill that requirement, the Cooperative s
members are contractually obligated to annually deliver corn to the Cooperative by either Method A or Method B or a combination of both.
Under Method A, a member is required to physically deliver corn to the Cooperative and under Method B a member appoints the Cooperative
as its agent to arrange for the acquisition and delivery of corn on the member s behalf. The Cooperative contractually appoints
Cargill as its agent to arrange for the delivery of the corn by its members who elect to deliver corn using Method A and to acquire corn
on its behalf for its members who elect to deliver corn using Method B. In exchange for these services, the Cooperative pays an annual
fee of , paid in quarterly
installments. 
 Performance Obligations 
 Members who deliver corn under Method A are paid the market price or contracted price for their corn at the time of delivery, as well as an incentive payment of per bushel. Cargill pays the aggregate purchase price for corn purchased from
 the Cooperative s members to the Cooperative and then, on the Cooperative s behalf, makes individual payments for corn and incentive payments directly to the Cooperative s members. In the event a member who has elected to deliver
 corn by Method A delivers to Cargill less than its committed amount of corn, the quantity of the shortfall is then purchased and delivered by Cargill on the Cooperative s behalf. The purchase price is equal to the average price reported for
 Method A corn for the final month of the year. In addition, the Method A member with a shortfall will be charged a purchased corn fee and agency fee determined by the Cooperative s Board of Directors. The aggregate purchase price for corn
 purchased from the Cooperative s members, plus any applicable purchased corn fee and agency fee comprise Method A corn revenue. At the end of each month, Cargill reports the number of Method A bushels delivered and the average daily price paid
 for corn that Cargill purchased from Members on the Cooperative s behalf. The product of the number of bushels delivered multiplied by the average monthly market price is reported as Method A corn expense. The incentive payment is also a
 component of Method A corn expense. 
 Members who elect Method B to deliver corn pay the Cooperative a 
 per bushel agency fee for the cost of having the Cooperative deliver corn on their behalf. Cargill acquires the corn as the Cooperative s
agent. Method B corn revenue will be equal to the price paid by Cargill to acquire the corn from the Cooperative, plus the member agency
fee. Corn expense for Method B deliveries will be the weighted average price for Method A corn during the quarter multiplied by the number
of Method B bushels purchased during the quarter. 
 Variable Consideration 
 The Cooperative s Board of Directors has the discretion to change the member incentive payment, purchased corn and agency fees based on the Cooperative s corn delivery needs. The Cargill agency fee is also a component of corn expense. 
 Significant Judgments 
 The evaluation of contracts with customers, performance obligations, and variable consideration requires significant judgment; the decision to combine contracts or separate a combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could
 change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. 
 For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Cooperative recognized corn revenue under ASC 606 of 47.4 million and 71.8 million, respectively. Disaggregated revenue for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024
 and 2023 is as follows: revenue from Method A deliveries totaled 13.3 million and 21.4 million, respectively; and revenue from Method B deliveries totaled 34.1 million and 50.4 million, respectively.

cautionary statements. 
 Overview 
 Golden Growers Cooperative is a value-added agricultural cooperative association governed under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 308B. The Cooperative is owned by 1,456 members and is in the business of providing value to its members by facilitating their delivery of corn to the corn wet-milling facility owned by ProGold Limited Liability Company ("ProGold LLC"), a Minnesota limited liability company in which the Cooperative and Cargill Incorporated ("Cargill") each own a 50 membership interest. The Cooperative accomplishes its business on behalf of its members through its contractual relationships with all of the parties involved in the ownership and operation of the facility. Annually, the Cooperative is required to deliver approximately 15,490,480 bushels of corn to Cargill for processing at the ProGold LLC facility. 
 Ownership in ProGold. From an income production
perspective, the Cooperative s membership interest in ProGold LLC is its primary asset that, in addition to giving
the Cooperative the right to receive distributions from ProGold LLC, also provides the Cooperative s members with additional value for the delivery of their corn for processing. Prior to March 1, 2022, the Cooperative and American Crystal Sugary Company American Crystal owned a 49 
and 51 interest in ProGold LLC, respectively. In connection with its interest in ProGold LLC, the Cooperative has the right and obligation to deliver corn for processing at the wet-milling facility. On April 4, 2017, the Cooperative, Cargill, and
American Crystal entered into a Consent Agreement, effective on January 1, 2018 (the "Consent Agreement"), relating to the lease of ProGold LLC s wet-milling facility to Cargill and the Cooperative s interest in ProGold LLC. On the same day, Cargill and American Crystal entered into an Option Agreement,
effective January 1, 2018 (the "Option Agreement"), detailing the price, term and other conditions under which American Crystal granted to Cargill an exclusive option (the "Option") to purchase a 50 interest in ProGold LLC from
American Crystal during the first four years of the lease. Under the Consent Agreement, the Cooperative approved and consented to the transfer of the 50 interest in ProGold LLC from American Crystal to Cargill in the event Cargill exercised its
option. The Cooperative also secured the right to purchase American Crystal s remaining 1 interest in ProGold LLC for a base price ranging from 1.3 million to 1.7 million, depending on when Cargill notified American Crystal of its intention
to exercise the Option. The Cooperative would also be required to pay to American Crystal a capital adjustment in an amount equal to 1 of the portion of costs that had not been paid by Cargill to ProGold LLC through additional rent with respect to
certain projects at the facility. 
 9 

On February 25, 2022, Cargill exercised its Option under the Option Agreement to purchase a 50 interest in ProGold LLC from American Crystal. Simultaneously with the exercise of the Option, the Cooperative, pursuant to
the Consent Agreement, elected to purchase American Crystal s remaining 1 interest in ProGold LLC. As a result of these transactions, effective March 1, 2022, the Cooperative and Cargill each own a 50 interest in ProGold LLC. 
 In connection with the Option exercise, the Cooperative, Cargill and ProGold LLC entered into that certain ProGold Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "Operating Agreement"), effective March 1, 2022, in order to set forth the structure, governance and operation of ProGold LLC according to certain operational principles and other
guidelines described in the Consent Agreement. Beginning March 1, 2022, the Cooperative is allocated 50 of the profits and losses of ProGold LLC and is entitled to receive 50 of any cash that is distributed to ProGold LLC s members. 
 For more information relating to the Cooperative s ownership interest in ProGold LLC, please refer to Part I, Item 1 of the Cooperative s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023. 
 ProGold Facility Lease. ProGold LLC leases its corn wet milling facility to Cargill, which uses the facility to process corn into high fructose corn syrup. In connection with the Option exercise, ProGold LLC and Cargill entered into that certain First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Facility Lease, effective March 1, 2022, which extended the term of the Facility Lease through December 31, 2026. 
 Membership and Delivery Obligations. Any person residing in the United States can own membership units of the Cooperative ("Units") as long as that person delivers or provides for the delivery of corn
for processing at the ProGold LLC facility. Ownership of Units requires members to deliver bushels of corn to the Cooperative for processing in proportion to the number of Units each member holds. Currently, 15,490,480 Units are issued and outstanding. The
Cooperative s income and losses are allocated to its members based on the volume of corn they deliver. Subject to certain limitations, as long as a member patronizes the Cooperative by delivering one (1) bushel of corn for each Unit held by
the member, the member will be allocated a corresponding portion of the Cooperative s income (or loss). In this way, the Cooperative operates on a cooperative basis. 
 To hold Units, a member is required to execute a Uniform Member Agreement that
obligates the member to deliver corn to the Cooperative and an Annual Delivery Agreement by which each member annually elects the
member s method to deliver corn - either Method A or Method B, or a combination of both. Under Method A, a member is required
to physically deliver the required bushels of corn to the Cooperative either at the facility or another location designated by the
Cooperative. Under Method B, a member appoints the Cooperative as its agent to arrange for the acquisition and delivery of the
required bushels of corn on the member s behalf. The Cooperative appoints Cargill as its agent to arrange for the delivery of
the corn by members who elect to deliver corn using Method A, and the Cooperative appoints Cargill as its agent to acquire corn on
the Cooperative s behalf for members who elect to deliver corn using Method B. If a member elects to deliver corn using Method
B, the price per bushel the Cooperative pays to the member is equal to the price per bushel paid by Cargill to acquire the corn as
its agent. Members who deliver corn under Method A are paid the market price or contracted price for their corn at the time of
delivery. Members who deliver corn under Method A also receive from the Cooperative an incentive payment of .05 per bushel on
the corn that they deliver while members who elect Method B to deliver corn pay to the Cooperative a .02 per bushel agency fee
for the cost of having the Cooperative deliver corn on their behalf. The incentive payment for Method A deliveries and the agency
fee for Method B deliveries are subject to annual adjustment at the sole discretion of the Cooperative s Board of Directors. While the Cooperative is financially responsible for the various payments to the members for corn, Cargill, serving as the Cooperative s administrative agent, issues payments to members for corn on the Cooperative s behalf 
 10 

Annually, the Cooperative notifies Cargill of the number of bushels of Method A corn to be delivered by each member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A. Once the Cooperative provides notification to Cargill of
the number of bushels of corn, Cargill then confirms the amount of corn with each member and notifies that member with respect to quality specifications, allowances, deductions and premiums to be applicable to that corn. The member with a Method A
corn commitment then directly contracts with Cargill for corn delivered by Method A. At the end of each month, Cargill reports the number of Method A bushels delivered and the average daily price paid for corn that Cargill purchased from members on
the Cooperative s behalf. The product of the number of bushels delivered multiplied by the average monthly market price is reported as Method A corn expense. In the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to Cargill
more than its delivery commitment, any corn delivered in excess of that commitment is handled as a direct sale of corn to Cargill. In the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to Cargill less than its committed amount
of corn, the quantity of the shortfall is then purchased and delivered by Cargill on the Cooperative s behalf. The purchase price is equal to the average price reported for Method A corn for the final month of the year. In addition, the Method
A member with a shortfall will be charged a purchased corn fee and agency fee determined by the Cooperative s Board of Directors. 
 Cargill then purchases the remainder of the corn to be delivered by the Cooperative on behalf of the Method B delivering members at such time and in such quantities as it deems appropriate and in the best interest of the Cooperative and Cargill. The Cooperative notifies Cargill of the number of Method B bushels to be purchased during the quarter. Cargill will certify to the Cooperative that it has purchased the necessary Method B bushels. The price paid is the weighted average price for Method A corn during the quarter multiplied by the number of Method B bushels. Method B corn revenue is equal to the price paid. 
 The Cooperative s Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws") establish a Method A delivery pool and a Method B delivery pool. Generally, the Cooperative s income and/or losses are allocated annually based on the percentage of bushels of corn the members elect to deliver using either Method A or Method B. Regardless of the actual percentage allocation between the members who deliver bushels of corn using Method A or Method B, the Bylaws require the Cooperative to annually allocate at least 15 of its income and/or losses to the Method A pool. The amount of the Cooperative s income and/or losses actually allocated to the Method A pool is a percentage equal to the greater of 15 or the actual percentage of bushels of corn delivered by members using Method A. 
 For fiscal year 2024, members elected to deliver 26.6 of their corn by Method A and 73.4 of their corn by Method B. This election will result in 26.6 of the Cooperative s income and/or losses and 26.6 of any cash distributions being allocated to the Method A pool in fiscal year 2024, which reflects the actual percentage of corn members elected
to deliver using Method A and does not result in reallocation to meet the 15 requirement set forth in the Cooperative s Bylaws. 
 Results of Operations 
 Revenues . The Cooperative derives revenue from two sources: operations related to the marketing of members corn and income derived from the Cooperative s membership interest in ProGold LLC. The corn
marketing operations generate revenue for the Cooperative equal to the value of the corn that is delivered to Cargill. The Cooperative recognizes expense equal to this same amount, which results in the corn marketing operations being revenue neutral
to the Cooperative, except for revenue from the Method B agency fee and expenses related to the Method A incentive payments and the service fee paid to Cargill. 
 For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Cooperative sold approximately 3.5 and 11.8 million bushels of corn, respectively, compared to approximately 3.4 and 11.8 million bushels of corn sold
during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023. For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the members, on the Cooperative s behalf, delivered to Cargill for processing at the facility approximately 0.7
and 3.3 million bushels of corn using Method A and 2.8 and 8.5 million bushels of corn using Method B. In the same respective periods in 2023, its members, on the Cooperative s behalf, delivered to Cargill for processing at the facility 0.6 and 3.4 million bushels of corn using Method A and 2.8 and 8.4 million bushels of corn using Method B. 
 11 

For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Cooperative recognized corn revenue of 13,446,000 and 47,390,000, respectively, compared to 17,476,000 and 71,781,000, during the same respective periods in 2023, a decrease of 23 for the third quarter and a decrease of 34 year to date due primarily to a decrease in the price per bushel of corn sold year to date in 2024 compared to the same respective periods in 2023. 
 Expenses. The Cooperative recognized corn expense of 13,464,000 and 47,432,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 17,493,000 and
 71,837,000 during the same respective periods in 2023, a decrease of 23 for the third quarter, and a decrease of 34 year to date due primarily to a decrease in the price per bushel of corn purchased in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 The Cooperative recognized expense of 15,000 and 45,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and during the same respective periods in 2023 in connection with costs
incurred to Cargill related to the Cooperative s corn marketing operation. 
 Income from ProGold LLC . The Cooperative derived income from ProGold LLC for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 of 1,576,000 and 4,715,000, respectively, compared to
 1,351,000 and 4,511,000 during the same respective periods in 2023, an increase of 17 for the third quarter and an increase of 5 year to date due primarily to timing of ProGold LLC expenses for the third quarter and an increase in
ProGold s lease revenue related to ProGold s Seconded Amended and Restated Facility lease with Cargill, dated April 4, 2017, as amended. 
 General and Administrative Expenses . The Cooperative s general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits, professional fees and fees paid to its Board of Directors. The general and
administrative expenses for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were 123,000 and 483,000, respectively, compared to 138,000 and 479,000 during the same respective periods in 2023. The decrease in
administrative expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to timing of expenses in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Other Income . Interest and investment income (loss) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was 126,000 and 343,000, respectively, compared to 89,000) and 57,000 during
the same respective periods in 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased interest rate yields on corporate bonds. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Cooperative s working capital at September 30, 2024 was 6,545,000 compared to 4,739,000 at September 30, 2023. The increased working capital at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared
to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was the result of changes in the timing of maturities of the Cooperative s investments. 
 The Cooperative received cash distributions from ProGold LLC totaling 5,970,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared 5,791,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Increased ProGold LLC distributions
are primarily related to ProGold s increased lease with revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 In fiscal year 2018, the Cooperative invested a portion of its cash reserves in bonds. To ensure that the Cooperative would have access to cash if needed before the maturity of the bonds, the Cooperative also
established a 2,000,000 line of credit at a variable interest rate based on the prime rate. The line of credit was previously scheduled to terminate on October 16, 2024, but was extended to mature on October 16, 2026. The line of credit is
secured by the investment management agency account for the Cooperative maintained by Bell Bank. There was no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 The Cooperative had no long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023 and generated operating cash flows of 24,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to negative cash flows
of 242,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating cash flows for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the timing of
payments and liabilities in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Management believes that non-cash working capital levels, together with the Cooperative s cash and cash equivalents, are appropriate in the current business environment and does not expect a significant increase
or reduction of non-cash working capital in the next twelve months. Management expects that the Cooperative s cash and cash equivalents, together with available borrowings under the line of credit, will be sufficient to fund its operations for
the foreseeable future, including at least the next twelve months.

Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 The Cooperative generally does not pay out Method A incentive payments or collect Method B agency fees until the end of its fiscal year. The total annual Method B agency fee was determinable once the members completed
their delivery method determination prior to January 1, 2024. The quarterly Method B bushel delivery and agency fee revenue is calculated by allocating the portion of the total annual agency fee for that particular quarter or cumulating it for the
particular period. The Cooperative tracks Method A corn deliveries throughout the year so it can report the bushels of corn delivered by its members as well as the corresponding Method A incentive fees earned. The final amounts owed by or due to
Cargill and/or the Cooperative s members who elect to deliver using Method A is not calculated until after December 31 in order to account for any failures to deliver, or over-deliveries, of corn. 
 The Cooperative s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to the Financial Statements in the Cooperative s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The Cooperative s critical accounting estimates are discussed in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations , in the Cooperative s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no other significant changes in the Cooperative s significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, the Cooperative is not required
to provide disclosure pursuant to this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 The Cooperative s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Cooperative s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 240.13a -15(e)
and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that review and evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that the Cooperative s current disclosure
