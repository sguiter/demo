In no event, however, may the number of common shares available for the grant of awards in any fiscal year exceed percent of the common shares outstanding as of the first day of that fiscal year. Common shares subject to an award that is forfeited, terminated, or canceled without having been exercised are generally added back to the number of shares available for grant under the 2024 Stock Plan.

Compensation costs for stock options are recognized over the requisite service period on the straight-line recognition method. Compensation cost recognized for stock options was for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Compensation cost for PRSUs and RSUs is determined using a fair-value method and amortized on the straight-line recognition method over the requisite service period. Intrinsic value is defined as the amount by which the fair market value of a common share exceeds the grant date price of a PRSU or an RSU. Compensation expense on PRSUs and RSUs totaled for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We estimated the fair value of each stock-based award on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial model are based on historical volatility of our stock prices and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The binomial model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock-based awards is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding.

At December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized tax benefits of , of which would affect our effective rate if recognized, and accrued interest expense related to unrecognized benefits of . Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return, and the benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes. 
 We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. 
 The Company is routinely under audit by U.S. federal, state and local authorities and Canadian authorities in the area of income tax. These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. With the exception of U.S. state jurisdictions and Canada, the Company is no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for the years through 2019. As of September 28, 2024, we believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly increase or decrease.

Payments on the promissory note can be made either by payroll deductions or annual lump-sum payments of both principal and interest.

Dividends will be paid on all subscribed shares, subject to forfeiture to the extent that payment is not ultimately made for the shares. 
 All participants in the offering who purchased in excess of of common shares were granted a right to purchase one additional common share at a price of per share for every common shares purchased in the offering. As a result of the stock subscription, rights to purchase common shares were granted. Each right may be exercised at the rate of one-seventh per year and will expire seven years after the date that the right was granted. A purchaser may not exercise a right once he or she ceases to be the Company's employee or non-employee director, as applicable.

 Based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, we believe that our established accruals are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of a matter will not exceed established accruals. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period. 
 Georgia Wrongful Death Suit 
 In November 2017, a wrongful death lawsuit was filed in Savannah, Georgia in the State Court of Chatham County State Court against Davey Tree, its subsidiary, Wolf Tree, Inc. Wolf Tree ), a former Davey employee, a Wolf Tree employee, and former Wolf Tree employees. That complaint, as subsequently amended, alleges various acts of negligence and seeks compensatory damages for the wrongful death of the plaintiff s husband, a Wolf Tree employee, who was shot and killed in August 2017. 
 In July 2018, a related survival action was filed in Savannah, Georgia by the deceased s estate against Davey Tree, its subsidiary, Wolf Tree, and current and former employees, which arises out of the same allegations, seeks compensatory and punitive damages and also includes Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO claims under Georgia law seeking treble damages. The 2018 case was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, Savannah Division Federal Court ), on August 2, 2018. 
 The cases were mediated unsuccessfully in December 2018 and the State Court case was originally set for trial on January 22, 2019. However, as discussed below, the two civil cases were ultimately stayed for more than four years. 
 On December 6, 2018, a former Wolf Tree employee pled guilty to conspiracy to conceal, harbor, and shield illegal aliens. On December 21, 2018, the United States Department of Justice DOJ filed a motion to stay both actions on the grounds that on December 7, 2018, an indictment was issued charging former Wolf Tree employees and another individual with various crimes, including conspiracy to murder the deceased. The State Court case was stayed on December 28, 2018 and the Federal Court case was stayed on January 8, 2019. On January 29, 2019, the State Court ordered the parties to return to mediation, which occurred on April 17, 2019, but was unsuccessful in resolving the matters.

 of the individually charged defendants had either been convicted at trial or pled guilty to Federal criminal charges in the Federal Court related to their involvement with the murder and other illegal activities. All criminal defendants have now been sentenced. 
 During the pendency of the criminal cases, the civil cases were stayed. Once the individual defendants' criminal matters resolved, the State Court permitted limited additional discovery and amended motions for summary judgment. On March 6, 2024, the State Court granted the plaintiff s motion to drop less than all parties from the lawsuit. As a result, Davey Tree is the only remaining defendant in the State Court case. The State Court had also set a civil jury trial for the week of July 29 to August 2, 2024. The Company filed a Third Motion for Summary Judgment after the dismissal of the other defendants, and the Court granted the Company s Third Motion for Summary Judgment in part and denied it in part on June 25, 2024. Due to the significant change to the claims in the case, the Court further vacated the previously set trial date of July 29, 2024. A new trial date has been set for June 2, 2025. 
 The stay in the Federal Court case was lifted on April 4, 2023. The Company moved to dismiss the alleged civil RICO claims, further filed a motion to stay the case until the motion to dismiss was decided, and moved for partial summary judgment on certain state law claims. The Federal Court granted the Company s motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. On March 27, 2024, the Federal Court ordered the plaintiff to refile a deficient RICO statement, dismissed the Company s motion to dismiss without prejudice and leave to refile once the plaintiff s RICO statement has been refiled, and set a briefing schedule. The Company then refiled its Motion to Dismiss in early summer 2024 and that Motion to Dismiss remains pending. The Federal Court has not yet set a trial date. 
 Previously, on December 17, 2018, the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Georgia United States Attorney informed the Company and Wolf Tree that they are also under investigation for potential civil or other violations of immigration and other laws relating to the subject matters of the criminal investigation referenced above. The Company and Wolf Tree fully cooperated with the investigation. 
 On July 12, 2023, the Company and Wolf Tree entered into a non-prosecution and settlement agreement (the settlement agreement with the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the United States Department of Homeland Security DHS ), resolving the investigation for potential violations of immigration and other laws by the Company and Wolf Tree. 
 The United States Attorney recognized that, since August 2017, both the Company and Wolf Tree have fully cooperated with the criminal and civil investigation and, in entering into the settlement agreement, the United States Attorney took into consideration the Company s and Wolf Tree s implementation of a significant compliance program. 
 The Company and Wolf Tree agreed to pay as part of the settlement agreement, including civil penalties, forfeiture and restitution, an amount the Company and Wolf Tree had previously reserved. The United States Attorney agreed that it will not bring any criminal charges against the Company or Wolf Tree concerning the subject matter of the investigation and released the Company and Wolf Tree from civil liability concerning certain immigration code provisions. The DHS also agreed to release the Company and Wolf Tree from administrative liability relating to the subject matter of the investigation, all of which are subject to standard reservations of rights and certain reserved claims. The settlement agreement closes the investigation by the United States Attorney and DHS. The settlement is not an admission of liability by the Company or Wolf Tree.

On September 22, 2021, the Court granted Davey Tree s petition to coordinate all cases as a California Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding, In Re North Bay Fire Cases, JCCP No. 4955. As a result of the coordination order, all of the actions were stayed in their home jurisdictions, subject to further court order. 
 In November 2022, Davey Tree filed a cross-complaint against the Plaintiffs Trust and PG E related to the contractual obligations of limitation of liability and hold harmless. Since that time, Davey Tree has dismissed the cross-complaint against PG E without prejudice. The Plaintiffs Trust filed a demurrer which challenged Davey Tree s claim that the hold harmless provisions in its contracts with PG E are an obligation of the Plaintiffs Trust. In response to the demurrer, Davey Tree filed an amended cross-complaint against the Plaintiffs Trust on April 13, 2023. The Plaintiffs Trust has since filed another demurrer seeking to dismiss the cross complaint by Davey Tree, and Davey Tree has filed a response. The Plaintiffs Trust filed a motion for summary adjudication which challenged the limitation of liability as set forth in the assigned contracts. The Court denied the motion for summary adjudication in an order entered April 12, 2023. 
 At a case management conference in JCCP No. 4955 on February 24, 2022, the Court ordered that Davey Tree and the plaintiffs participate in a mediation. The mediation commenced on October 17, 2022. At a case management conference on September 26, 2023, the parties reported to the Court that they had reached a settlement in principle and needed additional time to work on a long form settlement agreement.

The Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP ), in conjunction with the related ESOT, provided for the grant to certain employees of certain ownership rights in, but not possession of, the common shares held by the trustee of the ESOT. Annual allocations of shares have been made to individual accounts established for the benefit of the participants. 
 Defined Contribution and Savings Plans-- Most employees are eligible to participate in The Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan. Effective January 1, 1997, the plan commenced operations and retained the existing ESOP participant accounts and incorporated a deferred savings plan (a 401(k) plan feature. Participants in the 401(k) plan are allowed to make before-tax contributions, within Internal Revenue Service established limits, through payroll deductions. Effective January 1, 2020, we match, in either cash or our common shares, of the first percent and of the next percent of each participant's before-tax contribution, limited to the first five percent of the employee s compensation deferred each year. All non-bargaining domestic employees who attained years of age and completed of service are eligible to participate. In May 2004, we adopted the 401K Match Restoration Plan, a defined contribution plan that supplements the retirement benefits of certain employees that participate in the savings plan feature of The Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan, but are limited in contributions because of tax rules and regulations. 
 Our common shares are not listed or traded on an established public trading market, and market prices are, therefore, not available. Semiannually, an independent stock valuation firm assists with the appraisal of the fair market value of our common shares based upon our performance and financial condition. The Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan includes a put option for shares of the Company s common stock distributed from the plan. Shares are distributed from the Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan to former participants of the plan, their beneficiaries, donees or heirs (each, a participant ).

 (Amounts in thousands, except share data) 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
 We provide a wide range of arboricultural, horticultural, environmental and consulting services to residential, utility, commercial and government entities throughout the United States and Canada. 
 Our Business --Our operating results are reported in two segments organized by type or class of customer: Residential and Commercial, and Utility. Residential and Commercial provides services to our residential and commercial customers including: the treatment, preservation, maintenance, removal and planting of trees, shrubs and other plant life; the practice of landscaping, grounds maintenance, tree surgery, tree feeding and tree spraying; the application of fertilizer, herbicides and insecticides; and natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development, and environmental planning. Utility is principally engaged in providing services to our utility customers--investor-owned, municipal utilities, and rural electric cooperatives--including: the practice of line-clearing and vegetation management around power lines and rights-of-way and chemical brush control, natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development, and environmental planning. All other operating activities, including research, technical support and laboratory diagnostic facilities, are included in All Other. 
 Recent Trends 
 Our business continues to be impacted by a number of macro-economic factors. Global supply chains and product availability remain highly challenged and ongoing global events in Eastern Europe, as well as the Israel-Hamas war, have only exacerbated an already difficult operating environment. These factors, combined with higher fuel costs, higher interest rates and a highly competitive labor market, have created an inflationary environment and cost pressures. 
 Inflation rates in the markets in which we operate have increased and may continue to rise. Inflation has led us to experience higher costs, including higher labor costs and costs for materials from suppliers and transportation costs, and, in the competitive markets in which we operate, we may not be able to increase our prices correspondingly to preserve our gross margins and profitability. If inflation rates continue to rise or remain elevated for a sustained period of time, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs.

 Cash Flow Summary 
 Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:

The amount of common shares offered to the Company for repurchase by the holders of shares distributed from the Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan is not within the control of the Company, but is at the discretion of the shareholders. The Company expects to continue to repurchase its common shares, as offered by its shareholders from time to time, at their then current fair value. However, other than for repurchases pursuant to the put option under the Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan, as described in Note Q, such purchases are not required, and the Company retains the right to discontinue them at any time.

 Capital Resources 
 Cash generated from operations, our revolving credit facility and note issuances are our primary sources of capital. 
 Business seasonality traditionally results in higher revenues during the second and third quarters as compared with the first and fourth quarters of the year, while our methods of accounting for fixed costs, such as depreciation and amortization expense, rent and interest expense, are not significantly impacted by business seasonality. Capital resources during these periods are equally affected. We satisfy seasonal working capital needs and other financing requirements with the revolving credit facility and other short-term lines of credit. We

 continually review our existing sources of financing and evaluate alternatives. At September 28, 2024, we had working capital of 232,455, availability under short-term lines of credit approximating 10,323 and 191,884 available under our revolving credit facility. 
 For more information regarding our outstanding debt, see Part I - Item 1 - Note G, Short and Long-Term Debt and Commitments Related to Letters of Credit. 
 We believe our sources of capital, at this time, provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our capital-spending plans and to continue to complete business acquisitions for at least the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. 
 As discussed in our 2023 Annual Report, we believe that our policies related to revenue recognition, the allowance for credit losses, stock valuation and self-insurance accruals are our critical accounting policies and estimates --those most important to the financial presentations and those that require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. 
 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to accounts receivable, specifically those receivables under contractual arrangements primarily with Utility customers; allowance for credit losses; and self-insurance accruals. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies have not changed materially from those discussed in our 2023 Annual Report.

 Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual future results, except as required by applicable securities laws.

 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 (c) Inherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 
 Part II. Other Information 
 Items 3 and 4 are not applicable. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are party to a number of lawsuits, threatened lawsuits and other claims arising out of the normal course of business. On a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These accruals may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we do not record an accrual, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, we believe that our established accruals are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of a matter will not exceed established accruals. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period. 
 Georgia Wrongful Death Suit 
 In November 2017, a wrongful death lawsuit was filed in Savannah, Georgia in the State Court of Chatham County State Court against Davey Tree, its subsidiary, Wolf Tree, Inc. Wolf Tree ), a former Davey employee, a Wolf Tree employee, and two former Wolf Tree employees. That complaint, as subsequently amended, alleges various acts of negligence and seeks compensatory damages for the wrongful death of the plaintiff s husband, a Wolf Tree employee, who was shot and killed in August 2017. 
 In July 2018, a related survival action was filed in Savannah, Georgia by the deceased s estate against Davey Tree, its subsidiary, Wolf Tree, and four current and former employees, which arises out of the same allegations, seeks compensatory and punitive damages and also

 includes three Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO claims under Georgia law seeking treble damages. The 2018 case was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, Savannah Division Federal Court ), on August 2, 2018. 
 The cases were mediated unsuccessfully in December 2018 and the State Court case was originally set for trial on January 22, 2019. However, as discussed below, the two civil cases were ultimately stayed for more than four years. 
 On December 6, 2018, a former Wolf Tree employee pled guilty to conspiracy to conceal, harbor, and shield illegal aliens. On December 21, 2018, the United States Department of Justice DOJ filed a motion to stay both actions on the grounds that on December 7, 2018, an indictment was issued charging two former Wolf Tree employees and another individual with various crimes, including conspiracy to murder the deceased. The State Court case was stayed on December 28, 2018 and the Federal Court case was stayed on January 8, 2019. On January 29, 2019, the State Court ordered the parties to return to mediation, which occurred on April 17, 2019, but was unsuccessful in resolving the matters. 
 By November 2022, all three of the individually charged defendants had either been convicted at trial or pled guilty to Federal criminal charges in the Federal Court related to their involvement with the murder and other illegal activities. All three criminal defendants have now been sentenced. 
 During the pendency of the criminal cases, the civil cases were stayed. Once the individual defendants' criminal matters resolved, the State Court permitted limited additional discovery and amended motions for summary judgment. On March 6, 2024, the State Court granted the plaintiff s motion to drop less than all parties from the lawsuit. As a result, Davey Tree is the only remaining defendant in the State Court case. The State Court had also set a civil jury trial for the week of July 29 to August 2, 2024. The Company filed a Third Motion for Summary Judgment after the dismissal of the other defendants, and the Court granted the Company s Third Motion for Summary Judgment in part and denied it in part on June 25, 2024. Due to the significant change to the claims in the case, the Court further vacated the previously set trial date of July 29, 2024. A new trial date has been set for June 2, 2025. 
 The stay in the Federal Court case was lifted on April 4, 2023. The Company moved to dismiss the alleged civil RICO claims, further filed a motion to stay the case until the motion to dismiss was decided, and moved for partial summary judgment on certain state law claims. The Federal Court granted the Company s motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. On March 27, 2024, the Federal Court ordered the plaintiff to refile a deficient RICO statement, dismissed the Company s motion to dismiss without prejudice and leave to refile once the plaintiff s RICO statement has been refiled, and set a briefing schedule. The Company then refiled its Motion to Dismiss in early summer 2024 and that Motion to Dismiss remains pending. The Federal Court has not yet set a trial date. 
 Previously, on December 17, 2018, the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Georgia United States Attorney informed the Company and Wolf Tree that they are also under investigation for potential civil or other violations of immigration and other laws relating to the subject matters of the criminal investigation referenced above. The Company and Wolf Tree fully cooperated with the investigation. 
 On July 12, 2023, the Company and Wolf Tree entered into a non-prosecution and settlement agreement (the settlement agreement with the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the United States Department of Homeland Security DHS ), resolving the investigation for potential violations of immigration and other laws by the Company and Wolf Tree. 
 - 48 - 

Index 

 The United States Attorney recognized that, since August 2017, both the Company and Wolf Tree have fully cooperated with the criminal and civil investigation and, in entering into the settlement agreement, the United States Attorney took into consideration the Company s and Wolf Tree s implementation of a significant compliance program. 
 The Company and Wolf Tree agreed to pay 3,984,325 as part of the settlement agreement, including civil penalties, forfeiture and restitution, an amount the Company and Wolf Tree had previously reserved. The United States Attorney agreed that it will not bring any criminal charges against the Company or Wolf Tree concerning the subject matter of the investigation and released the Company and Wolf Tree from civil liability concerning certain immigration code provisions. The DHS also agreed to release the Company and Wolf Tree from administrative liability relating to the subject matter of the investigation, all of which are subject to standard reservations of rights and certain reserved claims. The settlement agreement closes the investigation by the United States Attorney and DHS. The settlement is not an admission of liability by the Company or Wolf Tree. 
 The civil cases in the State Court of Chatham County in Georgia and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, Savannah Division relating to the same subject matter, remain pending. The civil case in the State Court of Chatham County, Georgia has set a trial date of June 2, 2025. No trial date has been set in the District Court civil case. In both civil cases, the Company and Wolf Tree have denied all liability and are vigorously defending against the actions. The Company also has retained separate counsel for some of the individual defendants, each of whom has denied all liability and also are vigorously defending the actions. 
 Northern California Wildfires 
 Five lawsuits were filed that name contractors for PG E Corporation and its subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (together, PG E ), including Davey Tree, with respect to claims arising from a wildfire event that occurred in Pacific Gas and Electric Company s service territory in northern California beginning on October 8, 2017. An action was brought on August 8, 2019 in Napa County Superior Court, entitled Walker, et al. v. Davey Tree Surgery Company, et al ., Case No. 19CV001194. An action was brought on October 8, 2019 in San Francisco County Superior Court, entitled Abram, et al. v. ACRT, Inc., et. al , Case No. CGC-19-579861. An action was brought on October 7, 2019 in San Francisco Superior Court, entitled Adams, et al. v. Davey Resource Group, Inc., et al., Case No. CGC-19-579828. An action was brought on October 8, 2019 in Sacramento Superior Court, entitled Antone, et al. v. ACRT, Inc. et al., Case No. 34-2019-00266662. An action was brought on October 7, 2019 in Sacramento Superior Court, entitled Bennett, et al. v. ACRT, Inc. et al. , Case No. 2019-00266501. 
 Three additional actions were brought on January 28, 2021 in San Francisco County Superior Court, by fire victims represented by a trust Plaintiffs Trust ), which was assigned contractual rights in the PG E bankruptcy proceedings. These cases are entitled John K. Trotter, Trustee of the PG E Fire Victim Trust v. Davey Resource Group, Inc., et al ., Case No. CGC-21-589438; John K. Trotter, Trustee of the PG E Fire Victim Trust v. Davey Resource Group, Inc., et al ., Case No. CGC-21-589439; and John K. Trotter, Trustee of the PG E Fire Victim Trust v. ACRT Pacific, LLC, et al ., Case No. CGC-21-589441. On September 22, 2021, the Court granted Davey Tree s petition to coordinate all cases as a California Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding, In Re North Bay Fire Cases, JCCP No. 4955. As a result of the coordination order, all of the actions were stayed in their home jurisdictions, subject to further court order. 
 In November 2022, Davey Tree filed a cross-complaint against the Plaintiffs Trust and PG E related to the contractual obligations of limitation of liability and hold harmless. Since that time, Davey Tree has dismissed the cross-complaint against PG E without prejudice. The Plaintiffs Trust filed a demurrer which challenged Davey Tree s claim that the hold harmless provisions in its contracts with PG E are an obligation of the Plaintiffs Trust. In response to the demurrer, Davey Tree filed an amended cross-complaint against the Plaintiffs Trust on April 13, 2023. The Plaintiffs Trust has since filed another demurrer seeking to dismiss the cross complaint by Davey Tree, and 
 - 49 - 

Index 

 Davey Tree has filed a response. The Plaintiffs Trust filed a motion for summary adjudication which challenged the limitation of liability as set forth in the assigned contracts. The Court denied the motion for summary adjudication in an order entered April 12, 2023. 
 At a case management conference in JCCP No. 4955 on February 24, 2022, the Court ordered that Davey Tree and the plaintiffs participate in a mediation. The mediation commenced on October 17, 2022. At a case management conference on September 26, 2023, the parties reported to the Court that they had reached a settlement in principle and needed additional time to work on a long form settlement agreement. The parties jointly requested that the Court continue trial dates and other proceedings while the parties attempt to reach final terms on a global resolution. The Court originally set a trial date for October 2, 2023 involving the claim of the Plaintiffs Trust as to the Atlas burn location. On July 26, 2023, based on a joint request by the parties, the Court vacated the October 2, 2023 Atlas trial date and reset the Atlas trial for February 26, 2024, which has been vacated. 
 On November 10, 2022, the Court authorized the plaintiffs to contact Napa County Superior Court for the purpose of setting a trial date in the Walker case for claims related to the Patrick burn location. On December 15, 2022, the Court in the Walker case set a trial date of March 4, 2024. Pursuant to the parties stipulation, that trial date was continued to August 19, 2024. On April 30, 2024 the parties filed a joint stipulation to continue the trial date for 90 days. The trial was later set for December 4, 2024. On October 9, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation mutually requesting that the trial and all related dates be continued approximately 45 days after the current December 4, 2024 trial date, or thereafter as convenient to the court. 
 Davey Tree has responded to all claims asserted by the plaintiffs in these actions, denying all liability, and is vigorously defending against plaintiffs' alleged claims. However, we believe that a range of losses is probable and we have accrued our best estimate within this range which is also equal to our total coverage limits under our self-insurance and third party insurance providers for the 2017-2018 policy year of 220,000,000. We believe that any losses would be recovered through our self-insurance and third party insurance providers and have accrued a corresponding insurance recoverable within our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023.

The Company provides a ready market for all shareholders through our direct purchase of their common shares although we are under no obligation to do so (other than for repurchases pursuant to the put option under The Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan). 
 
 Our common shares are not listed or traded on an established public trading market and market prices are, therefore, not available. Semiannually, for purposes of the Davey 401KSOP and ESOP, an independent stock valuation firm assists with the appraisal of the fair market value of the common shares, based upon our performance and financial condition, using a peer group of comparable companies selected by that firm. The peer group currently consists of: ABM Industries Incorporated; Comfort Systems USA, Inc.; Dycom Industries, Inc.; FirstService Corporation; MYR Group, Inc.; Quanta Services, Inc.; Rollins, Inc.; and Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. The semiannual valuations are effective for a period of six months and the per-share price established by those valuations is the price at which our Board of Directors has determined our common shares will be bought and sold during that six-month period in transactions involving Davey Tree or one of its employee benefit or stock purchase plans. Since 1979, we have provided a ready market for all shareholders through our direct purchase of their common shares, although we are under no obligation to do so (other than for repurchases pursuant to the put option under The Davey 401KSOP and ESOP Plan, as described in Part I - Item 1 - Note Q, The Davey 401KSOP and Employee Stock Ownership Plan ). The purchases described above were added to our treasury stock. 
 At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company held on May 16, 2017, the shareholders of the Company approved proposals to amend the Company's Articles of Incorporation to (i) expand the Company's right of first refusal with respect to proposed transfers of shares of the Company's common shares, (ii) clarify provisions regarding when the Company may provide notice of its decision to exercise 
 - 51 - 

Index 

 its right of first refusal with respect to proposed transfers of common shares by the estate or personal representative of a deceased shareholder, and (iii) grant the Company a right to repurchase common shares held by certain shareholders of the Company. 
 On May 10, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a policy regarding the Company's exercise of the repurchase rights granted to the Company through amendments to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as approved by shareholders on May 16, 2017. 
 Until further action by the Board, it is the policy of the Company not to exercise its repurchase rights under the amended Articles with respect to shares of the Company's common shares held by current and retired employees and current and former directors of the Company (subject to exceptions set forth in the policy) (collectively, Active Shareholders ), their spouses, their first-generation descendants and trusts established exclusively for their benefit. 
 Until further action by the Board, it is also the policy of the Company not to exercise its rights under the amended Articles to repurchase shares of the Company's common shares proposed to be transferred by an Active Shareholder to his or her spouse, a first-generation descendant, or a trust established exclusively for the benefit of one or more of an Active Shareholder, his or her spouse and first-generation descendants of an Active Shareholder, or upon the death of an Active Shareholder, such transfers from the estate or personal representative of a deceased Active Shareholder. The Board may suspend, change or discontinue the policy at any time without prior notice. 
 In accordance with the amendments to the Articles approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting, on May 17, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 400,000 common shares, which authorization was increased by an additional 2,000,000 common shares in May 2018 and increased further by an additional 3,000,000 common shares in September 2021. Of the 5,400,000 total shares authorized, 2,798,291 remained available under the program, as of September 28, 2024. Share repurchases may be made from time to time and the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares, and repurchases may be commenced, suspended or discontinued from time to time without prior notice. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
