The words anticipates, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this Report may include, for example, statements about our: ability to complete our initial business combination; success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements; potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; pool of prospective target businesses; the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential investment opportunities; potential change in control if we acquire one or more target businesses for stock; the potential liquidity and trading of our securities; the lack of a market for our securities; use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; financial performance following our initial public offering; or depleting resources available for an initial business combination on negotiations and diligence of a target that ultimately does not consummate such that remaining resources are insufficient to complete an initial business combination with another target. 
 The forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.

Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of private placement units Private Placement Units at a price of per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to the Company s sponsor, Western Acquisition Ventures Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor ), generating gross proceeds of which is described in Note 4. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, and the sale of the Private Placement Units, the Company consummated the closing of the sale of additional Units upon receiving notice of the underwriter s election to fully exercise its overallotment option Overallotment Units ), generating additional gross proceeds of .

As of September 30, 2024, offering costs for the IPO amounted to , consisting of of underwriting fees and of other costs. The Company was to pay Alliance Global Partners A.G.P. a business combination marketing agreement fee in an amount equal to of the gross proceeds of the IPO (an aggregate amount due to A.G.P of if the Company is successful in completing a Business Combination from the amounts being held in the Trust Account (as defined below). If the Company is not successful in completing a Business Combination, A.G.P. will not be entitled to any of this fee (see Note 6). In connection with the Business Combination contemplated with Cycurion Inc. Cycurion ), A.G.P., and the Company amended the fee arrangement whereby rather than the cash fee described above, the Company will distribute shares of common stock.

 of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amounts due under the business combination marketing agreement and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance the Company will be able to successfully effect such a Business Combination. The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either: (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination; or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (to be approximately per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company s Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 Subtopic 10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., Public Warrants), the initial carrying value of the Public Shares classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and other Options. The Public Shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either: (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument; or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. While redemptions cannot cause the Company s net tangible assets to fall below , the Public Shares are redeemable and are classified as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place. Redemptions of the Company s Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to an agreement relating to the Company s Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares sold in the IPO, without the prior consent of the Company. The Company s Sponsor, officers, and directors (the Initial Stockholders have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock in conjunction with any such amendment.

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), Nasdaq will provide the Company a cure period in order to regain compliance as follows: (i) until the earlier of the Company s next annual stockholders meeting or December 28, 2024; or (ii) if the Company s next annual stockholders meeting is held before June 25, 2024, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than June 25, 2024 (the Cure Period ). If the Company fails to regain compliance within the Cure Period in connection with the Second Letter, the Nasdaq Listing Rules require the Staff to provide written notification to the Company that its securities will be delisted. The Company is actively engaged in efforts to regain compliance with the requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 and plans to regain compliance within the Cure Period provided by Nasdaq. On April 10, 2024, the Company held a virtual special meeting of stockholders to vote on the proposals identified in the Proxy Statement for the Special Meeting.

On July 10, 2024 , the Company dismissed its previous independent accounting firm, Marcum LLP, and engaged WWC, P.C., as its independent auditor.

On September 6, 2024, the Company received written notice (the Nasdaq Letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Company is delinquent in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (the Form 10-Q ), which may serve as an additional basis for the delisting of the Company s securities from Nasdaq. The Company previously filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC on August 14, 2024, disclosing that it was unable to file the Form 10-Q within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense. In accordance with Nasdaq s listing rules, the Company has 60 calendar days after the Notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Pursuant to the Nasdaq Letter, following receipt of such plan, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Form 10-Q s due date, or until February 17, 2025, for the Company to regain compliance. The Company intends to take the necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing rules and expects that, with the filing of this Form 10-Q, it has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). On September 20, 2024, Sponsor agreed to loan the Company for certain transaction expenses related to the Business Combination. On the same day, the Company loaned Cycurion for certain transaction expenses in connection with Cycurion s consummation of the Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by January 11, 2025, the Company intends to: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay: (a) its income and franchise taxes and (b) up to of dissolution expenses, if any, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve, and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. The Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the time to consummate a business combination (the Combination Period ). However, since the Initial Stockholders acquired Public Shares in the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. A.G.P. has agreed to waive its rights to its business combination marketing agreement fee (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only per share held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who has executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the

Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Forward Looking Statements above and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report. Overview We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses (a Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering IPO and the sale of the placement units that occurred simultaneously with the completion of our IPO, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock, and debt. We have identified an acquisition target and, as described in further detail below, executed a merger agreement with the intention of closing a Business Combination on or before the time allotted to do so. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of these acquisition plans and cannot assure you that we will be successful. The information that follows under the heading Proposed Business Combination and elsewhere in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide information relevant to assess the Company from our management s perspective regarding the Company.

Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were organizational activities and the search for a prospective Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds of the IPO placed in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with searching for, and completing, a Business Combination. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 375,004 This consisted of professional fees, general and administrative expenses and franchise taxes. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 253,633. This consisted of 256,970 in professional fees, general and administrative expenses, income tax expense and franchise taxes and 48,576 of interest income on marketable securities in the Trust Account and 45,239 of change in fair value of the forward purchase agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 670,325. This consisted of 1,208,217 in professional fees, general and administrative expenses, income tax expense and franchise taxes, 127,224 of Expense related to Non-Redemption Agreement offset by 665,116 of change in fair value of the forward purchase agreement. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 757,781. This consisted of 876,968 in professional fees, general and administrative expenses, income tax expense and franchise taxes and 331,690 of interest income on marketable securities in the Trust Account and 212,503 of change in fair value of the forward purchase agreement. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 45,150 in restricted cash available exclusively for payment of current tax liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 3,664,323. The Company s liquidity is to be satisfied through the proceeds from loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties held outside of the Trust Account. The Company s officers, directors, and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 511,636, which is primarily due to a net loss of 670,325, change in fair value of forward purchase agreement of 665,116, expense related to the Issuance of non-redemption agreements of 127,224 and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 696,581. Net cash provided by investing activities was 508,502 which was due to the withdrawal from the Trust Account in connection with redemption of 620,636 and withdrawal from Trust Account to pay franchise and income taxes of 72,866, partially offset by 185,000 cash paid in connection with Cycurion promissory note. Net provided by financing activities was 39,633 which was due to the payment made for the redemption of shares of 620,636 offset by proceeds from loan payable of 354,269, proceeds from sponsor promissory note of 230,000 and proceeds from sponsor advance of 76,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 646,799, which is primarily due to a net loss of 757,781, change in fair value of forward purchase agreement of 212,503, interest income on marketable securities of 331,690, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 230,169. Net cash provided by investing activities was 114,269,494 which was due to the withdrawal from the Trust Account to pay redeeming shareholders of 114,329,594 and 60,100 deposited into the Trust Account. Net provided by financing activities was 114,129,594 which was due to the payment made for the redemption of shares of 114,329,594 offset by proceeds from loan payable of 200,000. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. We may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Going Concern In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that the mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution described in Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, should the Company be unable to complete a Business Combination, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. JOBS Act The Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act (the JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of executive compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.

These holders are entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the termination of the applicable lock-up period for the securities to be registered. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the final prospectus relating to the IPO to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the IPO price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On January 14, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment option and purchased 1,500,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit. The underwriters were paid an underwriting fee of 500,000 at the closing of the IPO. As an additional underwriting fee, on June 16, 2021, the Sponsor transferred 1,207,500 of the Founder Shares to an affiliate of A.G.P. for 7,000. On November 22, 2021, the Company effected a 2 for 3 reverse stock split of its common stock, and A.G.P. sold back to the Sponsor 55,000 Founder Shares for 478, such that A.G.P. owns 750,000 Founder Shares.

The Company was to pay A.G.P. a fee for such marketing services upon the consummation of a Business Combination in an amount equal to 4.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 5,175,000 in the aggregate (exclusive of any applicable finders fees that might become payable). The Business Combination Marketing Agreement will be terminated upon entry into the Advisory Agreement (described below). Service Provider Agreements The Company plans to enter into advisory agreements with certain of its service providers to fund its obligations in shares of common stock instead of cash. Advisory Agreement with A.G.P. The Company plans to enter into an advisory agreement with A.G.P. (the Advisory Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company shall pay A.G.P. a total transaction fee equal to 2,500,000 (the Transaction Fee upon the closing of the Business Combination. The Transaction Fee will be payable in the form of preferred shares of the Combined Company that are convertible into 500,000 shares of the Combined Company s common stock (such preferred shares or the common into which they convert, the Transaction Fee Shares ), for a price per share of common stock equal to 5.00. A portion of the Transaction Fee Shares shall be subject to forfeiture back to the Company once A.G.P. converts and sells Transaction Fee Shares generating sales proceeds (excluding commissions) of 2,500,000. The Transaction Fee Shares shall be subject to a lock-up ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which 75 of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock is converted into shares of the Combined Company s common stock and (ii) three months from the Closing date (the Lock-Up Termination Date ).

This restriction shall remain in effect beginning on the Lock-Up Termination Date and ending on the date on which 100 of the Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of the closing is converted into shares of the Combined Company s common stock.

The Promissory Note, with an interest rate of 5 per annum is payable upon the sooner of the consummation of the Business Combination with Cycurion, or January 11, 2024.

Cycurion may not seek recourse against any money held in the Trust Account established pursuant the Borrower s investment management trust agreement, dated as of January 11, 2022, as amended, by and between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, nor any of the Company s directors, officers, and any affiliate.

On October 9, 2024, the Company and Cycurion amended the Promissory Note to extend the maturity date of this note to the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or January 11, 2025. Forward Purchase Agreement On January 10, 2023, the Company, Cycurion, and Alpha, entered into a Forward Share Purchase Agreement (the FPA ). Prior to effecting the FPA, Alpha had purchased shares from an unaffiliated party which had elected to redeem 300,000 shares of Common Stock, par value 0.0001 per share (such purchased Shares, the Recycled Shares .) Under the terms of the FPA, once the proposed Business Combination is effective, and twelve months (or six to nine months if submitted in writing to the Company) have elapsed, Alpha may elect to sell and transfer to the Company up to that number of shares that are then held by Alpha, and the Company shall purchase from Alpha, up to that number of shares that are then held by Alpha, but not to exceed 300,000 shares in the aggregate unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties, at a price per share equal to the Redemption Price (as defined in the charter.) The FPA provides that subject to conditions under the FPA on the date that is 12 months after the closing of the Business Combination (the BC Closing provided that, Alpha, at Alpha s sole discretion, may accelerate such date to any of six (6) months after the BC Closing and nine (9) months after the BC Closing by providing notice to WAVS of its election to so accelerate at least two (2) calendar days prior to such date (any such date, the Put Date ), Alpha may elect to sell and transfer to WAVS up to that number of Shares that are then held by Alpha, but not to exceed 300,000 Shares in the aggregate at a price per Recycled Share equal to the Redemption Price (as defined in Section 9.2(a) of the Current Charter) (the Shares Purchase Price ). The Put Date may be accelerated by Alpha if (i) the Shares are delisted from the New York Stock Exchange of NASDAQ, (ii) the Agreement is terminated for any reason after the date redemption requests are due in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Business Combination, or (iii) during any 30 consecutive trading day period following the closing of the Business Combination, the VWAP Price (as defined below) for 20 trading days during such period shall be less than 3.00 per Share. For purposes of this Agreement, the VWAP Price per Share shall be determined for any trading day or any specified trading period using the Rule 10b-18 volume weighted average price per share of Common Stock as reported via a Bloomberg Terminal. The FPA also provides that WAV shall reimburse Alpha for all reasonable and necessary brokerage commissions incurred in connection with the Alpha s acquisition of Shares, in an amount not to exceed 0.05 per Share and 0.02 per disposition of each Share (see Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements).

 Employment Agreements On December 27, 2023, we entered into an employment agreement with James P. McCormick whereby the Company agreed to pay a total of 125,000 of total compensation annually, including 40,000 in cash and 85,000 in stock payment. Critical Accounting Estimates Derivative liabilities - Forward Purchase Agreement The Company accounts for its Forward Purchase Agreement FPA (see Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging , under which the FPA does not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classified the FPA as a liability at its fair value and adjusts the FPA to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the statements of operations. The FPA is valued using PWERM and certain components of the FPA are valued under the Monte Carlo model. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ). This update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. Since June 2016, the FASB issued clarifying updates to the new standard including changing the effective date for smaller reporting companies. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on its unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 will become effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is still reviewing the impact of ASU 2023-09. The Company s management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements. Change in Auditor On July 10, 2024, the Company dismissed its previous independent accounting firm, Marcum LLP Marcum ), and engaged WWC, P.C. WWC as its independent auditor. Before the engagement of WWC, the Company did not consult with WWC regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or proposed transaction or regarding the type of audit opinion that might be rendered by WWC on the Company s financial statements, and WWC did not provide any written or oral advice that was an important factor considered by WWC in reaching a decision as to any such accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, and the Company did not consult with WWC regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Marcum s reports on the Company s financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as previously publicly disclosed, contained no adverse opinions or disclaimers of opinions and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles (which contains an explanatory paragraph concerning Western s ability to continue as a going concern, as described in Note 1 to the financial statements).

Table of Contents 
 During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the subsequent period through July 10, 2024, there were (i) no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and Marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Marcum, would have caused Marcum to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in Marcum s reports on the Company s consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) no reportable events (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). The Company provided Marcum with a copy of the foregoing disclosure before its filing with the SEC and requested that Marcum furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the above statements and, if it does not agree, the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of the letter from Marcum dated July 12, 2024 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 15, 2024. Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK There have been no material changes to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out by our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Previously, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our inadequate control for the withdrawal of funds from the Trust Account and inadequate control for the accounting for certain accrued expenses as of December 31, 2023. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of the fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We may be subject to legal proceedings, investigations and claims incidental to the conduct of our business from time to time. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings brought against us. We are also not aware of any legal proceeding, investigation or claim, or other legal exposure that has a more than remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our inadequate control for failure to timely file this Form 10-Q. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. We have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our inadequate control for failure to timely file this Form 10-Q. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. To respond to the material weakness we identified, we plan to incorporate enhanced communication and documentation procedures between our operations team and the individuals responsible for preparation of financial statements, as described in Part II, Item 9A: Controls and Procedures included in our annual report filed on April 26, 2024 with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weakness. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. If we identify any new material weaknesses in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. See the Company s registration statement on Form S-4, as amended, filed with the SEC on November 1, 2024 , which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS There were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION .
