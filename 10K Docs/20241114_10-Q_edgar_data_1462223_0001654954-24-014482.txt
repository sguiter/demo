For purposes of this Quarterly Report, Nixxy, we, our, us, or similar references refers to Nixxy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. Overview Nixxy, Inc., a Nevada corporation (along with its subsidiaries, we , the Company , us , and our ), is a holding company that, through its subsidiaries, operates recruitment and career-related software platforms. Historically, the Company offered additional recruitment-related services, including on-demand contract recruiting and staffing.

Additionally, the Company owns a controlling interest in Atlantic Energy Solutions, Inc., a Colorado company that is traded on the OTC Markets (OTC:AESO). The Company is currently undergoing a strategic transformation, having sold its staffing business in 2023 and sold its Recruiter.com website in Q3 of 2024. The Company has announced plans to shift its focus, along with its license agreement with GoLogiq, and spin out the recruitment-related businesses to Atlantic Energy Solutions, which is currently undergoing a name change to CognoGroup, Inc. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete its planned spinout and strategic transformation. Operating Businesses and Revenue We generate revenue or have generated from the following activities: Software Subscriptions : We offered a subscription to our web-based platforms that help employers recruit talent. Our platforms allow customers to source, contact, screen, and sort candidates using data science, advanced email campaigning tools, and predictive analytics. As part of our software subscriptions, we offered enhanced support packages and On Demand recruiting support services for an additional fee. Additional fees may be charged when we place a candidate with our customer, depending on the subscription type. In such cases, if the candidate ceases to be employed by the customer during the initial 90 days (the 90-day guarantee), we refund the customer in full for all fees paid by the customer. In December of 2022, we sold one of our software platforms to Talent, Inc. that was used in the delivery of the subscription service. Subsequently, we continued providing the service, but leveraged third-party tools in the delivery of services. 36 Table of Contents Recruiters On Demand : Consists of a consulting and staffing service specifically for the placement of professional recruiters, which we market as Recruiters On Demand. Recruiters On Demand is a flexible, time-based solution that provides businesses of all sizes access to recruiters on an outsourced, virtual basis for help with their hiring needs. As with other consulting and staffing solutions, we procure for our employer clients qualified professional recruiters, and then place them on assignment with our employer clients. We derive revenue from Recruiters On Demand by billing the employer clients for the placed recruiters ongoing work at an agreed-upon, time-based rate. We directly source recruiter candidates from our network of recruiters. In addition, we also offer talent planning, talent assessment, strategic guidance, and organizational development services, which we market as our Talent Effectiveness practice. Companies prepay for a certain number of consulting hours at an agreed-upon, time-based rate. We source and provide the independent consultants that provide the service. In March 2023, we announced a strategic partnership with Job Mobz to transition certain Recruiters on Demand clients and staff to Job Mobz in exchange for an ongoing revenue stream. We continued providing Recruiters on Demand service through a platform and anticipate continuing this work alongside Job Mobz as part of the Managed Services portion of the Asset Purchase Agreement, once the transaction closed. Full-time Placement: Consists of providing referrals of qualified candidates to employers to hire staff for full-time positions. We generated full-time placement revenue by earning one-time fees for each time that employers hire one of the candidates that we refer. Employers alert us of their hiring needs through our Platform, or other communications. We sourced qualified candidate referrals for the employers available jobs through independent recruiter users that access the Platform and other tools. We supported and supplemented the independent recruiters efforts with dedicated internal employees we call our internal talent delivery team. Our talent delivery team selects and delivers candidate profiles and resumes to our employer clients for their review and ultimate selection. Upon the employer hiring one or more of our candidate referrals, we earned a full-time placement fee , an amount separately negotiated with each employer client. The full-time placement fee is typically either a percentage of the referred candidates first year base salary or an agreed-upon flat fee. Marketplace: Our Marketplace category comprises services for businesses and individuals that leverage our online presence. For businesses, this includes sponsorship of digital newsletters, online content promotion, social media distribution, banner advertising, and other branded electronic communications, such as in our quarterly digital publication on recruiting trends and issues. We earn revenue as we complete agreed upon marketing related deliverables and milestones using pricing and terms set by mutual agreement with the customer. In some cases, we earn a percent of revenue a business receives from attracting new clients by advertising on our online platform. Businesses can also pay us to post job openings on our proprietary job boards to promote open job positions they are trying to fill. In addition to its work with direct clients, we categorize all online advertising and affiliate marketing revenue as Marketplace. For individuals, Marketplace includes services to assist with career development and advancement, including a resume distribution service which involves promoting these job seekers profiles and resumes to assist with their procuring employment, and upskilling and training. Our resume distribution service allows a job seeker to upload his/her resume to our database, which we then distribute to our network of recruiters on the Platform. We earn revenue from a one-time flat fee for this service. We also offer a recruiter certification program which encompasses our recruitment related training content, which we make accessible through our online learning management system. Customers of the recruiter certification program use a self-managed system to navigate through a digital course of study. Upon completion of the program, we issue a certificate of completion and make available a digital badge to certify their achievement for display on their online recruiter profile on the Platform. Consulting and Staffing: Consists of providing consulting and staffing personnel services to employers to satisfy their demand for long- and short-term consulting and temporary employee needs. We generate revenue by first referring qualified personnel for the employer s specific talent needs, then placing such personnel with the employer, but with our providers acting as the employer of record for us, and finally, billing the employer for the time and work of our placed personnel on an ongoing basis. Our process for finding candidates for consulting and staffing engagements largely mirrors our process for full-time placement hiring. This process includes employers informing us of open consulting and temporary staffing opportunities and projects, sourcing qualified candidates through the Platform and other similar means, and, finally, the employer selecting our candidates for placement after a process of review and selection. We bill these employer clients for our placed candidates ongoing work at an agreed-upon, time-based rate, typically on a weekly schedule of invoicing. Through a strategic sale to Futuris, Inc. In October 2023, we exited the Consulting and Staffing line of business, and consider it discontinued. Revenue Share : We refer certain clients to a third party in exchange for a referral fee. The amount of the referral fee is dependent upon whether the referral is an existing client of ours and what services we currently provide that client, or a client of a third party who is not historically serviced by us. Referral fees under the revenue share arrangement are subject to certain minimum and maximum payout amounts. We record referral fees earned under our revenue share arrangement on a net basis. 37 Table of Contents The costs of our revenue primarily consist of employee costs, third-party staffing costs and other fees, outsourced recruiter fees and commissions based on a percentage of our gross margin.

The amortization expense in 2024 and 2023 relates to the intangible assets acquired from Genesys (now our Recruiting Solutions division), Scouted, Upsider, OneWire, Parrut Novo Group, and GOLQ in 2024. General and Administrative General and administrative expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, includes compensation-related costs for our employees dedicated to general and administrative activities, legal fees, audit and tax fees, consultants and professional services, and general corporate expenses. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, our general and administrative expenses were 7.1 million, including 5.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. In 2023, for the corresponding period, our general and administrative expenses were 5.3 million, including 1.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. 42 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was expense of 7.6 million compared to income of 234 thousand in the corresponding 2023 period. The primary reason for the loss in 2024 was due to a loss on debt settlement of 9.2 million. Net Income (Loss) For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss from continuing operations of 15.1 million compared to a net loss of 5.9 million during the corresponding nine-month period in 2023. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income from discontinued operations of 0 thousand compared to a net income of 0.5 million during the corresponding nine-month period in 2023. 43 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 1.7 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 1.9 million for the corresponding nine-month period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 15.1 million. Net loss includes non-cash items of depreciation and amortization expense of 844 thousand, bad debt recovery of 86 thousand, impairment expense of 25 thousand, loss on settlement of consulting agreement of 153 thousand, loss or (gain) on settlement of debt settlement of 8.5 million, stock-based compensation expense of 5.0 million, loss on fair value of marketable securities of 247 thousand, gain on sale of assets of 1.8 million, change in fair value of warrant liability of 73 thousand, and amortization of debt discount and debt costs of 177 thousand. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 1.9 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of 4.7 million for the corresponding nine-month period in 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net loss was 5.3 million. Net loss includes non-cash items of depreciation and amortization expense of 974 thousand, bad debt expense of 175 thousand, equity-based compensation expense of 1.1 million, amortization of debt discount and debt costs of 1.2 million, and a factoring discount fee and interest of 20 thousand. Changes in operating assets and liabilities include primarily the following: accounts receivable decreased by 99 thousand and prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by 684. Accounts payable, accrued liabilities, deferred payroll taxes, other liabilities, and deferred revenue increased in total by 245 thousand. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 1.8 million. The principal factor was proceeds from a sale of assets for 1.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 1.2 million. The principal factor was issuance of common stock for 2.2 million which was partially offset by repayment of notes payable for 1.0 million. 44 Table of Contents Based on cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, of approximately 2.2 million, we do not have the capital resources to meet our working capital needs for the next 12 months. Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We incurred net losses and negative operating cash flows since inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net loss of 15.6 million. We have not yet established an ongoing source of revenue that is sufficient to cover our operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on us obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to our ability to continue as a going concern. We can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain, if any, will be sufficient to meet our needs, or that any such financing will be obtainable on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital, we could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail our commercial activities. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern. To date, equity offerings have been our primary source of liquidity and we expect to fund future operations through additional securities offerings. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates and assumptions. Included in these estimates are assumptions used to estimate collection of accounts receivable, fair value of marketable securities, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in asset acquisitions and the estimated useful life of assets acquired, fair value of contingent consideration, asset acquisitions and business combinations, fair value of derivative liabilities, fair value of securities issued for acquisitions and business combinations, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, fair value of intangible assets and goodwill, fair value of capitalized software, fair value of non-monetary transactions, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, and valuation of stock based compensation expense. Revenue Recognition Policy We recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB ), Accounting Standards Codification ASC ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). Revenues are recognized when control is transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods. Revenue recognition is evaluated through the following five steps: (i) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; (ii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determination of the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognition of revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. 45 Table of Contents Revenues as presented on the statement of operations represent services rendered to customers less sales adjustments and allowances. Software subscription revenues are recognized over the term of the subscription for access to services and/or our web-based platform. Revenue is recognized monthly over the subscription term. Talent effectiveness subscription revenues are recognized over the term of the subscription when services are provided. Any payments received prior to the time passing to provide the subscription services are recorded as a deferred revenue liability. Revenue generated from the enhanced support package and On Demand support are recognized at the point-in-time when the service is provided. Revenue generated from placement fees that are related to the software subscription are recognized at the point-in-time when the 60 or 90-day guarantee expires. Recruiters On Demand services are billed to clients as either monthly subscriptions or time-based billings. Revenues for Recruiters On Demand are recognized on a gross basis when each monthly subscription service is completed. Talent Effectiveness consulting services are billed to clients upfront for a period of 12 months. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis monthly over the period the consulting services are provided. Full-time placement revenues are recognized on a gross basis when the guarantee period specified in each customer s contract expires. No fees for direct hire placement services are charged to the employment candidates. Any payments received prior to the expiration of the guarantee period are recorded as a deferred revenue liability. Payments for recruitment services are typically due within 90 days of completion of services. Marketplace Solutions revenues are recognized either on a gross basis when the advertising is placed and displayed or when lead generation activities and online publications are completed, which is the point at which the performance obligations are satisfied. Payments for marketing and publishing are typically due within 30 days of completion of services. Marketplace advertising revenues are recognized on a gross basis when the advertising is placed and displayed or when lead generation activities and online publications are completed, which is the point at which the performance obligations are satisfied. Payments for marketing and publishing are typically due within 30 days of completion of services. Job posting revenue is recognized at the end of the period the job is posted. Marketplace career services revenues are recognized on a gross basis upon distribution of resumes or completion of training courses, which is the point at which the performance obligations are satisfied. Payments for career services are typically due upon distribution or completion of services. Consulting and Staffing Services revenues represent services rendered to customers less sales adjustments and allowances. Reimbursements, including those related to travel and out- of-pocket expenses, are also included in the net service revenues and equivalent amounts of reimbursable expenses are included in costs of revenue. We record substantially all revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent in the presentation of this line of revenues and expenses. We have concluded that gross reporting is appropriate because we have the task of identifying and hiring qualified employees, and our discretion to select the employees and establish their compensation and duties causes us to bear the risk for services that are not fully paid for by customers. Consulting and staffing revenues are recognized when the services are rendered by the temporary employees. We assume the risk of acceptability of the employees to customers. Payments for consulting and staffing services are typically due within 90 days of completion of services. Revenue share revenues represent a percentage of revenue we have earned in relation to client referrals we made to a third party. We record revenue in relation to revenue share on a net basis as an agent under this arrangement. We have concluded that net reporting is appropriate because we do not provide the underlying services and arrangements to meet the demands of the client that we referred to the third party. Revenue is recorded based on a net percentage of revenue that is shared between us and the third party and earned upon delivery of the services by the third party. The third party provides the underlying services in this arrangement. Deferred revenue results from transactions in which we have been paid for services by customers, but for which all revenue recognition criteria have not yet been met. Once all revenue recognition criteria have been met, the deferred revenues are recognized. 46 Table of Contents Sales tax collected is recorded on a net basis and is excluded from revenue. Goodwill Goodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business combinations in excess of the fair value assigned at acquisition to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment for its reporting units on an annual basis, or when events occur, or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment on December 31st of each year or as impairment indicators dictate. When evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill, management first assess a range of qualitative factors, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel, and the overall financial performance for each of our reporting units. If, after completing this assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then proceed to the impairment testing methodology using an appropriate valuation method. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by its estimated discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of impairment to be recognized is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. When required, we may arrive at our estimates of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology which includes estimates of future cash flows to be generated by specifically identified assets, as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of those anticipated cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and includes making assumptions about projected growth rates, industry-specific factors, working capital requirements, weighted average cost of capital, and current and anticipated operating conditions. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different results. Discontinued Operations In accordance with ASC 205-20 Discontinued Operations, the results of certain Recruiter Businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations. The Company evaluated the divestitures of the Recruiter Business in accordance with ASC 205-20 and determined that transactions in aggregate represented a strategic shift that had a major impact on the Company. Accounting for discontinued operations and the related gain on sale of discontinued operations requires us to make estimates and judgements regarding the allocation of costs and net asset values to discontinued operations. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Not applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer had concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting as identified below. 47 Table of Contents (b) Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsor Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency in internal control, or combination of control deficiencies, that adversely affects our ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report external financial data reliably in accordance with GAAP such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. In the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, (1) we lack a sufficient number of employees to properly segregate duties and provide adequate monitoring during the process leading to and including the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and (2) do not have the in-house technical expertise to identify and analyze complex or unusual transactions for proper accounting treatment. Accordingly, management s assessment is that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have worked to establish all the checks and balances needed for all financial areas of our business. We hired a consultant in mid-2020 to establish best practices and help us document and implement these. This consultant is a CPA and has a significant background in running the accounting and budgeting process for public companies. We began adopting these best practices during the fourth quarter of 2020. We retained an outsourced firm with a panel of CPA consultants in 2021 to assist in building internal controls and preparing financial reports. 48 Table of Contents PART II: OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are currently pursuing two related collections matters against BKR Strategy Group. Since 2013, BKR Strategy Group has provided talent acquisition strategy and services to top companies. Starting in the third quarter of 2021, BKR Strategy Group subcontracted Recruiter.com to perform on Demand recruiter services on behalf of BKR Strategy Group s clients. Although payments for services rendered were initially received in a timely fashion, BKR Strategy Group s balance grew throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2021. This led to BKR Strategy Group executing a Promissory Note with a payment schedule for 500,000 on November 30, 2021, with a personal guarantee from its business principal as part of the note. After failing to meet the payment schedule and after repeated attempts to collect the balance due, we retained the law firm of Berkovitch Bouskila, PLLC and filed two lawsuits against BKR Strategy Group on February 18, 2022, the first, to collect on unpaid invoices and the second, to enforce the promissory note, for a total sum of 1,400,000. On March 24, 2022, BKR Strategy Group made a counterclaim against us for 500,000 on the grounds of alleged overbilling. Management denies the basis for the counterclaim and expects to vigorously defend itself from this counterclaim. Outside counsel for the company has advised that at this stage in the proceedings, it cannot offer an opinion as to the probable outcome. As it is not possible to estimate if a loss will be incurred, there has been no accrual. On June 21, 2022, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County ruled in favor of the Company that BKR Strategy Group owes the Company 500,000, plus interest at 12 since November 22, 2021, through the entry of judgement in the lawsuit related to the enforcement on the Promissory Note executed by BKR Strategy Group. Proceedings in the other lawsuit remain ongoing. On or about September 6, 2023, Recruiter.com Group, Inc. (the "Company") was served with a civil lawsuit filed by Pipl, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut, Judicial District of New Britain. The lawsuit alleges that the Company failed to pay for goods and/or services provided by Pipl, Inc. between January 3, 2021, and December 7, 2022, with the claimed amount due exceeding 266,562.59 plus interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. The Company retained counsel and filed a counterclaim for breach of contract, alleging that Pipl Inc. failed to adequately perform under the contract, as well as claims for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment. Given that discovery has not been completed, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the case or estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, but continues to evaluate the case with counsel as more information becomes available. On March 13, 2024, Recruiter.com Group, Inc. ("the Company") became involved in legal proceedings initiated by Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. ("CAB"), as documented in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, case number 24CV433086. CAB's complaint, filed on March 13, 2024, alleges that the Company failed to fulfill payment obligations under contracts with CAB's assignor, totaling approximately 213,894.44. CAB seeks recovery of the owed amounts, interest, attorney fees, costs, and other damages deemed appropriate by the court. The Company has been defending itself vigorously, including filing a cross-complaint for indemnity against Onewire Holdings, LLC and NOVO Group, Inc. At this stage, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the case or estimate the potential financial impact. Except for the aforementioned proceedings described above, as of the date of this filing, there are no material pending legal or governmental proceedings relating to our Company or properties to which we are a party, and, to our knowledge, there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, executive officers, or affiliates are a party adverse to us or which have a material interest adverse to us. ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our future financial and operating results include those discussed in the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed April 16, 2024. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider significant may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS None. ITEM 3 - DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4 - MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5 - OTHER INFORMATION None. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 6 - EXHIBITS The following exhibits are filed as part of this Quarterly Report: Incorporated by Reference Filed or Exhibit No. Exhibit Description Form Filing Date Number Furnished Herewith 3.1 Amendment to Articles of Incorporation, filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on September 27, 2024 8-K 3101/24 3.1 3.2 Bylaws, as amended 8-K 10/1/24 3.2 3.3 Amendment to Articles of Incorporation, filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on September 3, 2024 8-K 9/12/24 3.1(e) 10.1 Recruiter.com Group, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan 8-K 9/12/24 10.1 10.2 Form of Debt Settlement and Release Agreement, dated July 10, 2024 8-K 7/16/24 10.1 10.3 Form of Share Purchase Agreement, dated July 12, 2024 8-K 7/16/24 10.2 10.4 Form of Registration Rights Agreement, dated July 12, 2024 8-K 7/16/24 10.3 10.5 Form of Debt Settlement and Release Agreement, dated September 19, 2024 8-K 9/17/24 10.2 31.1 Certification of Principal Executive Officer pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a), as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 X 31.2 Certification of Principal Financial Officer pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a), as adopted pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Filed 32.1 Certification of Principal Executive Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
