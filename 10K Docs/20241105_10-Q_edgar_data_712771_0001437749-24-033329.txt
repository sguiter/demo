Note 4. Investment Securities (continued) 
 
 Investment securities having a carrying value of approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, borrowings, repurchase agreements, access to unutilized Federal Reserve Discount Window, Bank Term Funding Program ("BTFP") borrowings, and access to unutilized Federal Home Loan Bank advances and for other purposes required or permitted by law. The BTFP was a temporary facility of the Federal Reserve and expired on March 11, 2024, contributing to the decrease in pledged securities as noted above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10 of stockholders equity. 
 
 The following table presents information for investments in securities available-for-sale as of September 30, 2024 , based on scheduled maturities. Actual maturities can be expected to differ from scheduled maturities due to prepayment or early call options of the issuer. Securities not due at a single maturity date are shown separately.

Note 4. Investment Securities (continued) 
 
 The Company has elected to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost of its investment securities available-for-sale. Accrued interest receivable for investment securities available-for-sale totaled million and million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. 
 
 The Company evaluates securities in an unrealized loss position for impairment related to credit losses on at least a quarterly basis. Securities in unrealized loss positions are first assessed as to whether we intend to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If one of the criteria is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through current earnings. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value resulted from credit losses or other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount that the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on asset backed securities and state and municipal securities have not been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality and we do not intend to sell and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities was recorded as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Federal agency obligations, residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities and commercial mortgage-backed pass-through securities are issued by U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government sponsored enterprises. Although a government guarantee exists on these investments, these entities are not legally backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government, and the current support they receive is subject to a cap as part of the agreement entered into in 2008. Nonetheless, at this time we do not foresee any set of circumstances in which the government would not fund its commitments on these investments as the issuers are an integral part of the U.S. housing market in providing liquidity and stability. Therefore, we concluded that a zero -allowance approach for these investment securities is appropriate. 

Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 The Company during 2021, 2022 and 2024 entered into twelve pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps, with a total notional amount of million. These are designated as cash flow hedges of outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We are required to pay fixed rates of interest ranging from to and receive variable rates of interest that reset quarterly based on the daily compounding secured overnight financing rate SOFR ). The twelve swaps carry expiration dates ranging from December 2025 to March 2028. The swaps are determined to be fully effective during the period presented and therefore no amount of ineffectiveness has been included in net income. Therefore, the aggregate fair value of the swap is recorded in other assets (liabilities) with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to current earnings should the hedges no longer be considered effective. The Company expects the hedges to remain fully effective during the remaining term of the swaps. 
 
 The Company previously entered into two forward starting interest rate cap spread transactions, one with a total notional amount of million, which became effective on October 1, 2022 and which matures in October of 2027 and one interest rate cap spread transaction, with a total notional amount of million, which became effective in November 2022 and which matures in November of 2027. These are designated as cash flow hedges of brokered certificates of deposit, and the interest rate cap spread is indexed to a benchmark of fed funds with payment required on a monthly basis. The structure of these instruments is such that the Company entered into a total of 225 million in notional amount of sold interest rate cap agreements, in which we are required to pay the counterparty an incremental amount if the index rate exceeds a set cap rate. Simultaneously, the Company purchased a total of million notional amount of interest rate cap agreements in which we receive an incremental amount if the index rate is above a set cap rate. No payments are required if the index rate is at, or below, the cap rate on the sold or purchased interest rate cap agreements. 
 
 Net interest income recorded on these swap and interest rate cap transactions totaled approximately million and million and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively, and is recorded as a component of either interest expense on FHLB Advances or on brokered certificates of deposit. 

The following table presents the net gains (losses) recorded in other comprehensive income and the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to the cash flow hedge derivative instruments for the periods indicated: 

The following table reflects the cash flow hedges included in the consolidated statements of condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 :

Nonaccrual loans include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated and loans that are individually evaluated. 
 
 Credit Quality Indicators - The Company continuously monitors the credit quality of its loans receivable. In addition to its internal monitoring, the Company utilizes the services of a third -party loan review firm to periodically validate the credit quality of its loans receivable on a sample basis. Credit quality is monitored by reviewing certain credit quality indicators. Assets classified Pass are deemed to possess average to superior credit quality, requiring no more than normal attention. Assets classified as Special Mention have generally acceptable credit quality yet possess higher risk characteristics/circumstances than satisfactory assets. Such conditions include strained liquidity, slow pay, stale financial statements, or other conditions that require more stringent attention from the lending staff. These conditions, if not corrected, may weaken the credit quality or inadequately protect the Company s credit position at some future date. Assets are classified Substandard if the asset has a well-defined weakness that requires management s attention to a greater degree than for loans classified special mention. Such weakness, if left uncorrected, could possibly result in the compromised ability of the loan to perform to contractual requirements. An asset is classified as Doubtful if it is inadequately protected by the net worth and/or paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral, if any, that secures the obligation. Assets classified as doubtful include assets for which there is a distinct possibility that a degree of loss will occur if the inadequacies are not corrected. 

We evaluate whether a modification, extension or renewal of a loan is a current period origination in accordance with GAAP. Generally, loans up for renewal are subject to a full credit evaluation before the renewal is granted and such loans are considered current period originations for purposes of the table below.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , the Company had commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for which the Company modified the terms of the loans in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension during the current period. 
 
 There were loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had a payment default during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and were modified in the twelve months prior to that default. Default is determined at 90 or more days past due, upon charge-off, or upon foreclosure. Modified loans in default are individually evaluated for the allowance for credit losses or if the modified loan is deemed uncollectible, the loan, or a portion of the loan, is written off and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Unfunded Commitments

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 : 
 
 Investment Securities Available-for-Sale and Equity Securities : Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 inputs include securities that have quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of instruments which would generally be classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy include municipal bonds and certain agency collateralized mortgage obligations. In certain cases where there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument, assumptions must be made to determine the fair value of the instruments and these are classified as Level 3. When measuring fair value, the valuation techniques available under the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used. The Company s evaluations are based on market data and the Company employs combinations of these approaches for its valuation methods depending on the asset class. 
 
 Derivatives : The fair value of derivatives is based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (level 2 ). Our derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. Therefore, the fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rate, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third -party pricing services. 
 
 For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy used as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows: 

Residential mortgage pass-through securities

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 The Company may be required periodically to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Loans Held-for-Sale : Residential mortgage loans, originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. For these loans originated and intended for sale, gains and losses on loan sales (sale proceeds minus carrying value) are recorded in other income and direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized in other income upon sale of the loan. Management obtains quotes or bids on all or parts of these loans directly from the purchasing financial institutions (Level 2 ). 
 
 Other loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value. Fair value of these loans is determined based on the terms of the loan, such as interest rate, maturity date, reset term, as well as sales of similar assets (Level 3 ). 

Collateral Dependent Loans : The Company may record adjustments to the carrying value of loans based on fair value measurements, generally as partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of these loans. These adjustments also include certain impairment amounts for collateral dependent loans calculated in accordance with GAAP. Impairment amounts are generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan and, as a result, the carrying value of the loan less the calculated impairment amount applicable to that loan does not necessarily represent the fair value of the loan. Real estate collateral is valued using independent appraisals or other indications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or assumptions generally observable by market participants. However, due to the substantial judgment applied and limited volume of activity as compared to other assets, fair value is based on Level 3 inputs. Estimates of fair value used for collateral supporting commercial loans generally are based on assumptions not observable in the marketplace and are also based on Level 3 inputs. 
 
 For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value measurements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:

The fair value of commitments to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of letters of credit and lines of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. The fair value of commitments to originate loans is immaterial and not included in the tables above. 
 
 Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on these estimated fair values. 
 
 The Company s remaining assets and liabilities, which are not considered financial instruments, have not been valued differently than has been customary with historical cost accounting. No disclosure of the relationship value of the Company s core deposit base is required by FASB ASC 825 - 10. 
 
 Fair value estimates are based on existing balance sheet financial instruments, without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For example, there are certain significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities, such as deferred taxes, premises and equipment, and goodwill. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates. 
 
 Management believes that reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely, due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must be made, given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies also introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.

 As of both September 30, 2024 and December, 31, 2023, the Company did not have any outstanding stock options. Restricted stock and deferred stock units typically have a three -year vesting period starting one year after the date of grant with one - third vesting each year, with accelerated vesting upon a change in control. Restricted stock and deferred stock units granted to new employees and board members may be granted with shorter vesting periods. Grants of performance units typically have a cliff vesting after three years or upon a change of control. All issuances are subject to forfeiture if the recipient is no longer employed prior to the award's vesting. Any forfeitures would result in previously recognized expense being reversed. Restricted stock grants have the same dividend and voting rights as common stock, while options, performance units and deferred stock units do not. 
 
 All awards are issued at the fair value of the underlying shares on the grant date. The Company expenses the cost of the awards, which is determined to be the fair market value of the awards at the date of grant, ratably, over the vesting or measurement period. Forfeiture rates are not estimated but are recorded as incurred. Stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and million respectively.

 Net Interest Income and Margin 
 
 Net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on the portfolio of earning assets (principally loans and investments) and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings, which support these assets. Net interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis by adjusting tax-exempt income (including interest earned on tax-free loans and on obligations of state and local political subdivisions) by the amount of income tax which would have been paid had the assets been invested in taxable assets. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis as a percentage of total average interest-earning assets. 
 
 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.5 million, or 2.4 , from the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from a nine basis-point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.67 from 2.76 , partially offset by a 13.5 million, or 1.9 , increase in average investment securities. The contraction of the net interest margin was primarily attributable to a 40 basis-point increase in the average cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 24 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield. 
 
 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 10.6 million, or 5.4 , from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease primarily resulted from an 18 basis-point decrease in the net interest margin to 2.67 from 2.85 , partially offset by a 72.6 million, or 0.9 , increase in average total loans. The contraction of the net interest margin was primarily attributable to a 69 basis-point increase in the average costs of deposits including noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 38 basis-point increase in the loan portfolio yield.

The increase in the provision for credit losses during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the comparable periods in 2023 reflects increases to the specific reserves, partially offset by a decrease in general reserves. 
 
 There were 3.5 million and 9.9 million in net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 2.5 million and 8.0 million in net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 respectively. Net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of charges related to five multifamily loans totaling 7.8 million, four commercial loans of 2.2 million and one owner-occupied commercial real estate loan of 0.3 million, while the net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily the result of the resolution of certain nonaccrual taxi loans and one owner-occupied commercial real estate loan that was previously reserved for. 
 
 The level of the allowance for the respective periods of 2024 and 2023 reflects the credit quality within the loan portfolio, loan growth, the changing composition of the commercial and residential real estate loan portfolios and other related factors. In management s view, the level of the ACL as of September 30, 2024 is adequate to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management s judgment regarding the adequacy of the allowance constitutes a Forward-Looking Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from management s analysis, based principally upon the factors considered by management in establishing the allowance.

Asset Quality 
 
 The Company manages asset quality and credit risk by maintaining diversification in its loan portfolio and through review processes that include analysis of credit requests and ongoing examination of outstanding loans, delinquencies, and potential problem loans, with particular attention to portfolio dynamics and mix. The Company strives to identify loans experiencing difficulty early on, to record charge-offs promptly based on realistic assessments of current collateral values and cash flows, and to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses at all times. 
 
 It is generally the Company s policy to discontinue interest accruals once a loan is past due as to interest or principal payments for a period of ninety days. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are generally applied against principal. A loan may be restored to an accruing basis when all past due amounts have been collected. Loans past due 90 days or more which are both well-secured and in the process of collection may remain on an accrual basis. 
 
 Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned. Nonaccrual loans represent loans on which interest accruals have been suspended. In general, it is the policy of management to consider the charge-off of uncollectible amounts of loans at the point they become past due 90 days.

Investment Securities 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the principal components of the securities portfolio were federal agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities, obligations of U.S. states and political subdivisions, corporate bonds and notes, asset-backed securities and equity securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, average securities, on an amortized cost basis, increased by 13.5 million to approximately 736.9 million, or 8.0 of average total interest-earning assets, from approximately 723.4 million, or 8.0 of average interest-earning assets, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average securities, on an amortized cost basis increased by 4.8 million to approximately 732.3 million, or 7.9 of average total interest-earning assets, from approximately 727.5 million, or 7.9 of average interest-earning assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, net unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, which are carried as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and included in stockholders equity, net of tax, amounted to 51.1 million as compared with net unrealized losses of 57.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in unrealized losses is predominately attributable to changes in market conditions and interest rates. Unrealized losses have not been recognized into income because the issuers are of high credit quality, we do not intend to sell, and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the securities. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis 
 
 The principal objective of our asset and liability management function is to evaluate the interest-rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts; determine the level of risk appropriate given our business focus, operating environment, and capital and liquidity requirements; establish prudent asset concentration guidelines; and manage the risk consistent with Board approved guidelines. We seek to reduce the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates, and actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the Bank s Asset Liability Committee (the ALCO ). The ALCO generally reviews our liquidity, cash flow needs, maturities of investments, deposits and borrowings, and current market conditions and interest rates. 
 
 The Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage interest rate risk including, but not limited to: (i) balancing the types and structures of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by diversifying mix, coupons, maturities and/or repricing characteristics, (ii) reducing the overall interest rate sensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing core and/or longer-term deposits; utilizing FHLB advances and wholesale deposits for our interest rate risk profile, (iii) managing the investment portfolio for liquidity and interest rate risk profile, and (iv) entering into interest rate swap and cap agreements. 
 
 We currently utilize net interest income simulation and economic value of equity EVE models to measure the potential impact to the Bank of future changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the results of the models were within guidelines prescribed by our Board of Directors. If model results were to fall outside prescribed ranges, action, including additional monitoring and reporting to the Board, would be required by the ALCO and the Bank s management. 
 
 The net interest income simulation model attempts to measure the change in net interest income over the next one-year period, and over the next three-year period on a cumulative basis, assuming certain changes in the general level of interest rates. The model also utilizes immediate and parallel shifts in market interest rates as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Based on our model, which was run as of September 30, 2024, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-point instantaneous and parallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 3.95 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous and parallel decrease in interest rates would increase net interest income by 1.32 . As of December 31, 2023, we estimated that over the next one-year period a 200 basis-point instantaneous and parallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 9.25 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous and parallel decrease in interest rates would increase net interest income by 5.34 . 
 
 Based on our model, which was run as of September 30, 2024, we estimated that over the next three years, on a cumulative basis, a 200 basis-point instantaneous and parallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 1.23 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous and parallel decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by 0.07 . As of December 31, 2023, we estimated that over the next three years, on a cumulative basis, a 200 basis-point instantaneous and parallel increase in the general level of interest rates would decrease our net interest income by 5.68 , while a 100 basis-point instantaneous and parallel decrease in interest rates would increase net interest income by 4.29 .

Table of Contents 

An economic value of equity ("EVE") analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows with instantaneous and parallel rate shocks of up 200 basis points and down 100 basis points. The EVE is likely to be different as interest rates change. Our EVE as of September 30, 2024, would decrease by 9.81 with an instantaneous and parallel rate shock of up 200 basis points, and increase by 2.23 with an instantaneous and parallel rate shock of down 100 basis points. Our EVE as of December 31, 2023, would decrease by 15.09 with an instantaneous and parallel rate shock of up 200 basis points, and increase by 5.75 with an instantaneous and parallel rate shock of down 100 basis-points. 
 
 The change in interest rate sensitivity was impacted by changes in overall market interest rates, updates to certain model assumptions, changes in short and intermediate-term fixed rate funding and by the deposit mix shift into certificates of deposit, from both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing non-maturity deposits. 
 
 The following table illustrates the most recent results for EVE and one-year NII sensitivity as of September 30, 2024.

Certain model limitations are inherent in the methodology used in the EVE and net interest income measurements. The models require the making of certain assumptions which may tend to oversimplify the way actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The models assume that the composition of the Company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured, thus they do not consider the Company s strategic plans, or any other steps it may take to respond to changes in rates over the forecasted period of time. Additionally, the models assume immediate changes in interest rates, based on yield curves as of a point-in-time, which are reflected in a parallel, instantaneous and uniform manner across all yield curves, when in reality changes may rarely be of this nature. The models also utilize data derived from historical performance and as interest rates change the actual performance of loan prepayments, rate sensitivities, and average life assumptions may deviate from assumptions utilized in the models and can impact the results. Accordingly, although the above measurements provide an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates. Given the nature and speed with which interest rates change, the projections noted above on the Company s EVE and net interest income can be expected to differ from actual results. 
 
 Estimates of Fair Value 
 
 The estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the Company s assets, including loans held-for-sale and securities available-for-sale. These are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors. Circumstances that could cause estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities to change include a change in prepayment speeds, discount rates, or market interest rates. Fair values for most available-for-sale securities are based on quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic condition risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations; unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Management actively monitors and manages its liquidity position to determine any current or potential future liquidity needs. Liquidity is a measure of a bank s ability to fund loans, withdrawals or maturities of deposits, and other cash outflows in a cost-effective manner. Our principal sources of funds are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal, maturities of investment securities, and funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flow and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
 
 Liquidity and funding needs are managed through the Bank's Treasury functions and the Asset Liability Committee. An internal policy addresses liquidity and funds management and management monitors the adherence to policy limits to satisfy current and potential future cash flow needs. The policy includes internal limits, deposit concentrations, liquidity sources and availability, stress testing, collateral management, contingency funding plan and other qualitative and quantitative metrics. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that, on a short and long-term basis, contractual liabilities, depositors withdrawal requirements, and other operational and client credit needs could be satisfied. As of September 30, 2024, liquid assets (cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and unencumbered investment securities) were 705.9 million, which represented 7.3 of total assets and 8.5 of total deposits and borrowings, compared to 516.3 million as of December 31, 2023, which represented 5.2 of total assets and 6.1 of total deposits and borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, not included in the above liquid assets were securities with a market value of 109.6 million which were pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank, which support aggregate unutilized borrowing capacity of 102.2 million as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, not included in the above liquid assets were securities with a market value of 276.0 million which were pledged to either the Federal Reserve Bank s Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ), or the Federal Home Loan Bank, which supported aggregate unutilized borrowing capacity of 300.5 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and, based on available qualified collateral as of September 30, 2024, had the ability to borrow 2.5 billion. The Bank also has a credit facility established with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for direct discount window borrowings based on pledged collateral and had the ability to borrow 1.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Bank had in place borrowing capacity of 305 million through correspondent banks and other unsecured borrowing lines. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had aggregate available and unused credit of approximately 2.9 billion, which represents the aforementioned facilities totaling 4.4 billion net of 1.4 billion in outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding commitments for the Bank to extend credit were approximately 1.1 billion. 
 
 Cash an d cash equivalents totaled 247.2 million as of September 30, 2024, decreasing by 4.5 million from 242.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Operating activities provided 28.5 million in net cash. Investing activities provided 211.7 million in net cash, primarily reflecting a decrease in loans. Financing activities used 235.6 million in net cash, primarily reflecting 191.5 million in net repayments of FHLB borrowings and a 12.0 million decrease in deposits.

Deposits 
 
 Deposits are our primary source of funds. Noninterest bearing demand deposit products include Totally Free Checking and Simply Better Checking for consumer clients and Small Business Checking and Analysis Checking for commercial clients. Interest-bearing checking accounts require minimum balances for both consumer and commercial clients and include Consumer Interest Checking and Business Interest Checking . Money market accounts consist of products that provide a market rate of interest to depositors. Our savings accounts offer paper and/or electronic statements. Time deposits ("TD") are for non-retirement and IRA accounts, generally with initial maturities ranging from 31 days to 60 months, and brokered TDs, which we use for asset liability management purposes and to supplement other sources of funding. Many of our deposit products can be accessed through both our branches and online to provide ease of access to our clients and communities. CDARS/ICS reciprocal deposits are offered based on the Bank s participation in the IntraFi Network LLC ("the Network"). Clients, who are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance sensitive, are able to place large dollar deposits with the Company and the Company utilizes CDARS to place those funds into certificates of deposit issued by other banks in the Network. This occurs in increments of less than the FDIC insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage in amounts larger than the insured dollar amount. Unless certain conditions are satisfied, the FDIC considers these funds as brokered deposits for certain reporting requirements. The Bank also utilizes internet listing services deposits which are obtained through the use of websites such as Rateline or QwickRate.

Average total deposits increased by 27.7 million, or 0.4 , during the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in total average deposits was attributed to increases in savings deposits of 143.5 million and time deposits of 19.2 million, partially offset by decreases in interest-bearing demand deposits of 119.6 million and noninterest-bearing demand deposits of 15.4 million. 
 
 The increase in average time deposits of 19.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 was attributed to increases in retail time deposits of 162.7 million, partially offset by decreases in nonreciprocal brokered time deposits of 70.1 million, CDARs of 63.9 million and internet listing services of 9.5 million. The Bank continues its utilization of nonreciprocal brokered time deposits to enhance balance sheet liquidity as it remains a favorable alternative to other borrowings. 
 
 Quarter-to-date average demand deposits have remained relatively stable as an industry trend away from noninterest-bearing accounts and into interest-bearing accounts has largely subsided. 
 
 Average demand deposits (including interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing) for both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023 included 1.2 billion in ICS reciprocal deposits. Average time deposits for the third quarter of 2024 included 66.6 million in CDARS, compared to 130.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in CDARS was attributed to maturities that did not renew.

Average total deposits increased by 29.2 million, or 0.4 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total average deposits was primarily attributed to increases in savings deposits of 109.5 million and time deposits of 52.1 million, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits of 103.3 million and interest-bearing demand deposits of 29.1 million. 
 
 The increase in average time deposits of 52.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributed to increases in retail time deposits of 121.8 million and internet listing services of 0.3 million, partially offset by decreases in CDARs of 44.9 million and nonreciprocal brokered time deposits of 25.2 million. 
 
 The decrease in year-to-date average noninterest-bearing demand deposits was consistent with industry trends reflecting higher levels of interest rates which resulted in migration of noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing transaction deposits. 
 
 Average demand deposits (including interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.2 billion in ICS reciprocal deposits, compared to 0.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average time deposits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 73.0 million in CDARS, compared to 117.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in CDARS was attributed to maturities that did not renew. 
 
 The beta, which is the measurement of deposit rate sensitivity in response to market rate changes, on nonreciprocal brokered deposits tends to be higher than that of ICS and CDARS reciprocal deposits, as nonreciprocal brokered time deposits are more directly correlated to prevailing market rates of interest, while ICS and CDARs reciprocal deposits reflect the Bank s relationship with reciprocal deposit clients and are more driven by a desire for FDIC insurance coverage than market leading rates.

Subordinated Debentures 
 
 During December 2003, Center Bancorp Statutory Trust II, a statutory business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Corporation issued 5.0 million of MMCapS capital securities to investors due on January 23, 2034. The trust loaned the proceeds of this offering to the Parent Corporation and received in exchange 5.2 million of the Parent Corporation s subordinated debentures. The subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or part prior to maturity. Upon the cessation of publication of LIBOR rates and pursuant to the Federal LIBOR Act and Federal Reserve regulations implementing the Act, the MMCapS capital securities converted as of June 30, 2023 to a new index based on CME Term SOFR, as defined in the LIBOR Act, plus a tenor spread adjustment, which is referred to as the Benchmark Replacement. Effective for quarterly interest rate resets after July 3, 2023 the subordinated debentures' floating rate will be three-month CME Term SOFR plus 2.85 plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161 . The rate as of September 30, 2024 was 8.37 . 
 
 During June 2020, the Parent Corporation issued 75 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the 2020 Notes ). The 2020 Notes bear interest at 5.75 annually from, and including, the date of initial issuance up to, but excluding, September 15, 2025 or the date of earlier redemption, payable semi-annually in arrears on September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing December 15, 2020. From and including September 15, 2025 through maturity or earlier redemption, the interest rate shall reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be Three-Month Term SOFR (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture), plus 560.5 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the benchmark rate is less than zero, then the benchmark rate shall be deemed to be zero.
