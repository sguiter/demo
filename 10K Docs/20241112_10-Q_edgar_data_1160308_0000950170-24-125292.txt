Under that master services agreement, work orders and subsequent change orders, the Company is currently obligated to pay the second source manufacturer, in total, estimated fees of million . These costs are subject to various cancellation fees ranging from ten percent to one hundred percent of the cost of the respective activity based upon the timing of the commencement date and status of the activity. Contract Research As part of its development of molgramostim for the treatment of aPAP, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement MSA with Parexel International (IRL) Limited Parexel pursuant to which Parexel will provide contract research services related to clinical trials. Contemporaneously with entering the MSA, a work order was executed with Parexel, under which they will provide services related to the IMPALA-2 trial. Under that work order and subsequent change orders, the Company will pay Parexel service fees, pass-through expenses, and investigator fees estimated to be approximately million over the course of the IMPALA-2 clinical trial and trial close-out activities. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated an open-label, multicenter clinical trial of inhaled molgramostim in pediatric subjects with aPAP ("Pediatric Study") under a separate work order with Parexel. Pursuant to the Pediatric Study, Parexel has the opportunity to earn up to approximately million in various milestone payments primarily dependent upon patient enrollment, site management, project oversight and the compliance with defined study protocols. Risk Management The Company maintains various forms of insurance that the Company's management believes are adequate to reduce the exposure to certain risks associated with operating the Company s business to an acceptable level.

 Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Any statements contained herein that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Savara s plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, and beliefs should be considered forward-looking statements. Savara s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to the following: the ability to project future cash utilization and reserves needed for contingent future liabilities and business operations, the risks associated with the process of conducting clinical trials and developing, obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing drug candidates that are safe and effective for use as human therapeutics, the timing and ability to raise additional capital as needed to fund continued operations, natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical events (including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war in the Middle East), the Company s ability to maintain compliance with its covenants under its long-term debt instruments and those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 7, 2024, all of which are difficult to predict. 
 Statements made herein are as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report with the SEC and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 
 The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Overview 
 Savara Inc. (together with its subsidiaries Savara, the Company, we, our or us is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases. Our sole program, molgramostim, is an inhaled biologic, specifically, inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in Phase 3 development for aPAP. Savara previously announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 clinical trial and plans to complete a Biological License Application submission with the FDA in the first quarter of 2025. Savara, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which include Aravas Inc. and Savara ApS, operate in one segment with its principal office in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, though a majority of our employees work remotely. 
 Since inception, we have devoted our efforts and resources to identifying and developing our product candidates, recruiting personnel, and raising capital. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flow from operations and have no product revenue from inception to date. From inception to September 30, 2024, we have raised net cash proceeds of approximately 594.9 million, primarily from underwritten offerings of our common stock, private placements of common stock, and debt financings. 
 We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses every year since inception. Our net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 24.2 million and 16.6 million, respectively, and the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 54.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 460.2 million. Our operating losses primarily resulted from expenses attributed to our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. 
 We have chosen to operate by outsourcing our manufacturing and most of our clinical operations. We expect to incur significant additional expenses and continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our primary product candidate. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 21.4 million and short-term investments of 198.0 million. We will continue to require additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Although we have sufficient capital to fund many of our planned activities, we may need to continue to raise additional capital to further fund the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidate and begin to commercialize any approved product. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on 
 16 

favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidate. 
 Recent Events 
 
 July 2024 Offering 
 
 On July 1, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 26,246,720 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share, pursuant to an underwritten offering at an offering price of 3.81 per share. The July 2024 Offering resulted in net proceeds of 93.8 million after taking into consideration underwriter commissions, legal fees, and other customary closing costs. The July 2024 Offering was made pursuant to the Company s 2024 Registration Statement. 
 
 Early Access Program 
 
 On September 27, 2024, Savara announced the launch of its Early Access Program, a molgramostim Expanded Access Program ("EAP") for patients with aPAP. The program enables physicians to request molgramostim for eligible aPAP patients in select geographies where the product is not commercially available and in compliance with local regulatory requirements. The Savara EAP has been reviewed and allowed to proceed by the FDA, and it is currently accepting requests from eligible patients in select countries in North America and Europe with plans to expand through 2026. 
 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 The largest component of our operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities. We recognize all research and development costs as they are incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of the following: 
 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations CROs ), consultants, and clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf; 

laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of our clinical trials; 

contract manufacturing expenses, primarily for the production of clinical supplies; and 

internal costs that are associated with activities performed by our research and development organization and generally benefit our molgramostim product candidate and program. Where appropriate, such internal costs consist primarily of: 

o personnel costs, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense; 

o facilities and other expenses, which include expenses for maintenance of facilities and depreciation expense; and 

o regulatory expenses and technology license fees related to development activities. 

We expect research and development expenses will remain significant in the future as we advance our molgramostim product candidate through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approvals, which will require a significant increased investment in regulatory support and contract manufacturing activities, including investing in the development of a second source manufacturer and clinical supplies. 
 The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in timely developing and achieving regulatory approval for our product candidate. The probability of success of our product candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, competition, intellectual property rights, manufacturing capability, and commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to accurately determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of molgramostim. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 G A expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and related costs for personnel in executive, finance and accounting, legal, and investor relations; as well as professional and consulting fees for accounting, legal, investor relations, business development, human resources, and information technology services. Other G A expenses include facility lease and insurance costs. 
 17 

Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense) includes amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs and debt discount under our Amended Loan Agreement executed with Silicon Valley Bank during April 2022 (the Amended Loan Agreement ). Refer to Note 6. Long-term Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. Interest expense is typically reported net of interest income which includes interest earned on our cash, cash equivalent, and short-term investment balances. Other income (expense) also includes net unrealized and realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange derivatives not designated as hedging, refundable tax credits generated by some of our foreign subsidiaries, and securities subject to fair value accounting as well as any other non-operating gains and losses. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have not been any material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the methodology applied by management for critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Please read Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further description of our critical accounting policies.

Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 6.4 million, or 46.5 , to 20.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to the performance of tasks related to our molgramostim program, which includes approximately 3.7 million of costs related to our chemistry, manufacturing, and controls activities, primarily driven by initiatives to establish our second drug substance manufacturer, 0.2 million of clinical costs driven by the ramp up of the pediatric study, 1.0 million of costs related to regulatory affairs and quality assurance, and 1.5 million due to an increase in personnel including related costs and other departmental overhead. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.9 million, or 45.0 , to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to personnel and related costs of 0.8 million, certain commercial activities of 0.9 million, and other departmental overhead of 0.2 million. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net increased by 0.7 million to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to an increase in Interest income as a result of higher balances in our short-term investments following various equity financings.

Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses increased by 23.2 million, or 73.7 , to 54.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to the performance of tasks related to our molgramostim program, which includes approximately 12.9 million of costs related to our chemistry, manufacturing, and controls activities, primarily driven by initiatives to establish our second drug substance manufacturer, 2.4 million of costs related to our IMPALA-2 trial and pediatric study, including CRO-related activities, 2.9 million of costs related to regulatory affairs and quality assurance, and approximately 5.0 million due to an increase in personnel including related costs and other departmental overhead. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses increased by approximately 6.4 million, or 58.9 , to 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to personnel and related costs of 2.5 million, certain commercial activities of 2.8 million, and other overhead of 1.1 million primarily driven by patient advocacy activities and consultant costs. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net increased by 1.4 million to 5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily related to an increase in Interest income as a result of higher balances in our short-term investments following various equity financings. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 21.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, 198.0 million in short-term investments, and an accumulated deficit of approximately 460.2 million. As discussed in Note 6. Long-term Debt in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, during April 2022, we entered into an Amended Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank that provided for a 26.5 million term loan facility, the proceeds of which were used to refinance all outstanding obligations under our pre-existing loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. 
 We have used and intend to use our liquidity and capital for working capital and general corporate purposes, which include, but are not limited to, the funding of clinical development of and pursuing regulatory approval for our product candidate and general and administrative expenses. As we continue to progress on the IMPALA-2 trial, pursue regulatory approval, and invest in pre-commercial activities, we will continue to monitor our liquidity and capital requirements.

Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 65.8 million, consisting of a net loss of 66.8 million and net 2.3 million in changes due to operating assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by approximately 3.3 million of net noncash charges (comprised of depreciation and amortization including right-of-use assets, accretion on premium to short-term investments, amortization of debt issuance costs, and stock-based compensation). 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Cash used in investing activities of 57.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily associated with purchases of short-term investments partially offset by proceeds from the maturities of short-term investments. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities of 118.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of net proceeds from the July 2024 Offering and the August 14, 2024 at-the-market sales offering. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidate. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development and manufacturing activities, particularly as we continue the research, development, manufacture, and clinical trials of, and seeking regulatory approval for, our product candidate. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidate, we anticipate we may need additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately 219.4 million. Although we have sufficient capital to fund our planned activities, including those discussed in Note 9. Commitments Manufacturing and Other Commitments and Contingencies , in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report, we may need to continue to raise additional capital to further fund the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidate and to begin commercialization of any approved product. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development, chemistry, manufacturing, controls, regulatory and commercialization efforts. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidate. 
 
 On July 1, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 26,246,720 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share, pursuant to the July 2024 Offering at an offering price of 3.81 per share. The July 2024 Offering resulted in net proceeds of 93.8 million after taking into consideration underwriter commissions, legal fees, and other customary closing costs. The July 2024 Offering was made pursuant to the Company s 2024 Registration Statement. 
 
 On August 14, 2024, the Company sold 6,038,650 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to its Sales Agreement with Evercore to a single institutional investor resulting in net proceeds of 24.4 million. These sales were made pursuant to the Company s 2024 Registration Statement. 
 Although we believe we are well capitalized based on our current operations, until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, we may finance our future cash needs primarily through the issuance of additional equity securities and potentially through borrowings, grants, and strategic alliances with partner companies. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidate to third parties that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements , of the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if any, on us. 
 20 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We have market risk exposure related to our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment securities. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, we have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 1 change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our investment securities are fixed income instruments denominated and payable in U.S. dollars and have short-term maturities, typically less than twelve months, and typically carry credit ratings of A at a minimum by two of three Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, specifically Moody s, Standard Poor s, or Fitch. As such, we do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity. 
 We also have interest rate exposure related to our long-term debt. Refer to Note 6. Long Term Debt of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional discussion. The Amended Loan Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank bears interest equal to the greater of (i) 3 and (ii) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus a spread of 0.5 , which was 7.5 on September 30, 2024. Changes in the prime rate would have impacted our interest expense associated with our secured term loan. If a 10 change in interest rates from the interest rates on September 30, 2024, were to have occurred, this change would not have had a material effect on our interest expense with respect to outstanding borrowed amounts. 
 We have ongoing operations in Europe and pay those vendors in local currency, including Euros or Danish Krone. At times, we seek to limit the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments and short-term foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments. We did not recognize any significant exchange rate losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. A 10 change in the Euro-to-dollar or Krone-to-dollar exchange rate on September 30, 2024, would not have had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Additionally, inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, supplies and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to and as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective and designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, litigation and other legal and administrative proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. We are not currently a party to any material pending litigation or other material legal proceeding. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors.

4. Exercise Procedures 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the Participant may exercise part or all of the vested portion of the Option by giving the Company written notice of intent to exercise in the manner provided in this Agreement, specifying the number of Shares as to which the Option is to be exercised. On the delivery date, the Participant shall pay the exercise price (i) in cash, (ii) with the approval of the Committee, by delivering previously owned Shares of the Company which shall be valued at their fair market value (as defined in the Plan) on the date of delivery, or (iii) payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. The Committee may impose from time to time such limitations as it deems appropriate on the use of Shares of the Company to exercise the Option. 

(b) The obligation of the Company to deliver Shares upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed appropriate by the Company, including such actions as Company counsel shall deem necessary or appropriate to comply with relevant securities laws and regulations. 

(c) The Company may require that the Participant (or other person exercising the Option after the Participant s death) represent that the Participant is purchasing Shares for the Participant s own account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution of the Shares, or such other representation as the Committee deems appropriate. 

(d) The Company shall be entitled to require a cash payment by or on behalf of the Participant and/or to deduct from other compensation payable to the Participant any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the Option. Alternatively, the Participant may irrevocably elect, in such manner and at such time or times prior to any applicable tax date as may be permitted or required under Section 15 of the Plan and rules established by the Administrator, to have the Company withhold and reacquire Shares at their fair market value at the time of vesting to satisfy any withholding obligations of the Company with respect to the Option; provided, however, that the number of such Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company s required tax withholding obligations up to the 

- 5 - 

maximum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. 

5. Designation as Incentive Stock Option. 

(a) The Option is intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code. The Company makes no guarantee that the Option will qualify as an incentive stock option. If the aggregate fair market value of the stock on the date of the grant with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year, under the Plan or any other stock option plan of the Company or a parent or subsidiary, exceeds one hundred thousand dollars 100,000), then the Option, as to the excess, shall be treated as a nonqualified stock option that does not meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. 

(b) The Participant understands that favorable incentive stock option tax treatment is available only if the Option is exercised while the Participant is an employee of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company or within a period of time specified in the Code after the Participant ceases to be an employee. The Participant understands that the Participant is responsible for the income tax consequences of the Option, and, among other tax consequences, the Participant understands that he or she may be subject to the alternative minimum tax under the Code in the year in which the Option is exercised. The Participant will consult with his or her tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of the Option. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall not be liable or responsible for any additional tax liability the Participant incurs in the event that the Internal Revenue Service for any reason determines that the Option does not qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of the Code. If and to the extent that the Option fails to qualify as an incentive stock option under the Code, the Option shall remain outstanding according to its terms as a nonqualified stock option. 

(c) The Participant agrees that the Participant shall immediately notify the Company in writing if the Participant sells or otherwise disposes of any Shares acquired upon the exercise of the Option and such sale or other disqualifying disposition occurs on or before the later of (i) two (2) years after the Date of Grant or (ii) one (1) year after the exercise of the Option. The Participant also agrees to provide the Company with any information requested by the Company with respect to such sale or other disposition. The Participant should consult his or her tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of such disqualifying disposition. 

6. Adjustments; Change of Control . The provisions of the Plan applicable to adjustments (as described in Section 10 of the Plan) or other corporate transaction, including a Change of Control (as described in Section 11 of the Plan), shall apply to the Option. 

7. Restrictions on Exercise . Except as the Company may otherwise permit pursuant to the Plan, only the Participant may exercise the Option during the Participant s lifetime and, after the Participant s death, the Option shall be exercisable (subject to the limitations specified in the Plan) solely by the legal representatives of the Participant, or by the person who acquires the right to exercise the Option by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, to the extent that the Option is vested and exercisable pursuant to this Agreement. 

- 6 - 

8. Grant Subject to Plan Provisions . This grant is made pursuant to the Plan, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and in all respects shall be interpreted in accordance with the Plan. The grant and exercise of the Option are subject to interpretations, regulations and determinations concerning the Plan established from time to time by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. The Committee shall have the authority to interpret and construe the Option pursuant to the terms of the Plan, and its decisions shall be conclusive as to any questions arising hereunder. 

9. No Employment or Other Rights . The grant of the Option shall not confer upon the Participant any right to be retained by or in the employ or service of the Company and shall not interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the Participant s employment or service at any time. The right of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) to terminate at will the Participant s employment or service at any time for any reason is specifically reserved. 

10. Clawback . In accepting the grant of the Option, the Participant agrees to be bound by any clawback policy that the Company may currently have in place or may adopt in the future. 

11. No Stockholder Rights . Neither the Participant, nor any person entitled to exercise the Participant s rights in the event of the Participant s death, shall have any of the rights and privileges of a stockholder with respect to the Shares subject to the Option, until certificates for Shares have been issued upon the exercise of the Option. 

12. Delivery Subject to Legal Requirements . The obligation of the Company to deliver Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Option shall be subject to the condition that if at any time the Board shall determine in its discretion that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issue of shares, the shares may not be issued in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Board. The issuance of Shares to the Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Option is subject to any applicable taxes and other laws or regulations of the United States or of any state having jurisdiction thereof. Upon the issuance or delivery of any Shares related to the Award, the Participant will make or enter into such written representations, warranties and agreements as the Company may reasonably request in order to comply with applicable securities laws or with this Agreement. 

13. Assignment and Transfers . The rights and interests of the Participant under this Agreement may not be sold, assigned, encumbered or otherwise transferred except, in the event of the death of the Participant, by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In the event of any attempt by the Participant to alienate, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the Option or any right hereunder, except as provided for in this Agreement, or in the event of the levy or any attachment, execution or similar process upon the rights or interests hereby conferred, the Company may terminate the Option by notice to the Participant, and the Option and all rights hereunder shall thereupon become null and void.
