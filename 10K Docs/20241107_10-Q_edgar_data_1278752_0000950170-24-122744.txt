 million during the prior fiscal quarter may be valued based on inputs identified by the Investment Adviser without the necessity of obtaining valuation from an independent valuation firm, if once annually an independent valuation firm using the procedures described herein provides an independent assessment of value. Investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, seniority of investment in the investee company s capital structure, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When readily available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , there were no significant changes to the Company s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in the valuation process.

of its investment company taxable income as defined by the Code, for each year. The Company (among other requirements) has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from corporate-level income taxes. For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. The tax character of distributions paid to stockholders through September 30, 2024 may include return of capital, however, the exact amount cannot be determined at this point. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will not be made until we file our tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 2024. The character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividend and distributions and other permanent book and tax difference are reclassified to paid-in capital. If we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains in the calendar year earned, we will generally be required to pay excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated undistributed taxable income.

 components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below: (i) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income - effective January 1, 2023 The Incentive Fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears by calculating the amount by which (x) the aggregate amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect of the current calendar quarter and each of the eleven preceding calendar quarters (in either case, the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (y) the preferred return amount in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters; provided, however, that the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the current calendar quarter exceeds the multiple of (A) and (B) the Company's net asset value at the beginning of such calendar quarter. For the purposes of the Incentive Fee calculations, each calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters that commenced prior to January 1, 2023 shall be known as a Legacy Fee Quarter while a calendar quarter that commenced on or after January 1, 2023 shall be known as a Current Fee Quarter. The preferred return amount is determined on a quarterly basis, and is calculated by summing the amounts obtained by multiplying by the Company s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The preferred return amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for Company capital issuances and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter. 

 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the preferred return amount but is less than or equal to the catch-up amount, which shall be the sum of (i) the product of multiplied by the Company's net asset value at the beginning of each applicable Legacy Fee Quarter included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters and (ii) the product of multiplied by the Company's net asset value at the beginning of each applicable Current Fee Quarter included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. (3) for any quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the catch-up amount, the incentive fee shall equal for each Legacy Fee Quarter and otherwise of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, provided, however, that the incentive fee on income for any quarter shall not be greater than or , as applicable, of the amount of the Company's current quarter s pre-incentive fee net investment income.

(ii) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income - (January 1, 2019 - December 31, 2022) For the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022, the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was determined and paid quarterly in arrears by calculating the amount by which (x) the aggregate amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect of the applicable calendar quarter and each of the eleven preceding calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter that commences on or after April 1, 2018 (the trailing twelve quarters exceeds (y) the preferred return amount in respect of the trailing twelve quarters. The preferred return amount was determined on a quarterly basis, and was calculated by summing the amounts obtained by multiplying by the Company s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The preferred return amount was calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for Company capital issuances and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter. The amount of the Incentive Fee on Income that was paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equaled the excess of the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income, so calculated less the aggregate incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income that were paid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if any) in the preceding eleven calendar quarters comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters. 

 of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters, if any, that exceeded the preferred return amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the catch-up amount determined by multiplying by the Company s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters. (3) for any quarter in which the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters exceeded the catch-up amount, the incentive fee should equal of the amount of the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such trailing twelve quarters. 
 The Incentive Fee on Income as calculated was subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap ). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter was an amount equal to (a) of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant trailing twelve quarters less (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees on Income that were paid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if any) in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters.

 If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the calculation described above, the Company shall pay the Investment Adviser the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap was equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the calculation described above, the Company shall pay the Investment Adviser the Incentive Fee on Income for such quarter. Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. B. Incentive Fee Based on Cumulative Net Realized Gains The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory management agreement). This fee shall equal of the sum of the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis, calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of investment advisory management agreement), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any Incentive Fees on Capital Gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser. The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation of the Company shall be calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company s portfolio as of the applicable calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. Prior to January 1, 2023, the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains was determined and paid in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory management agreement). This fee equaled of the sum of the Company s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis, calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of investment advisory management agreement), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any Incentive Fees on Capital Gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser. The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation of the Company was calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company s portfolio as of the applicable calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. For accounting purposes only, we are required under GAAP to accrue a theoretical capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and unrealized capital gain and loss on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual of this theoretical capital gains incentive fee assumes all unrealized capital gain and loss is realized in order to reflect a theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable to the Investment Adviser at each measurement date. There was accrual for theoretical capital gains incentive fee for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not be payable under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act or the investment advisory management agreement, and would not be paid based upon such computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts actually paid to the Investment Adviser will be consistent with the Advisers Act and formula reflected in the investment advisory management agreement which specifically excludes consideration of unrealized capital gain.

The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt and equity securities are primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA comparable multiples and market discount rates. The Company typically uses EBITDA comparable multiples on its equity securities to determine the fair value of investments. The Company uses market discount rates for debt securities to determine if the effective yield on a debt security is commensurate with the market yields for that type of debt security. If a debt security s effective yield is significantly less than the market yield for a similar debt security with a similar credit profile, the resulting fair value of the debt security may be lower. For certain investments where fair value is derived based on a recovery analysis, the Company uses underlying commodity prices from third party market pricing services to determine the fair value and/or recoverable amount, which represents the proceeds expected to be collected through asset sales or liquidation. Further, for certain investments, the Company also considered the probability of future events which are not in management s control. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the structured products include the discount rate applied in the valuation models in addition to default and recovery rates applied to projected cash flows in the valuation models. Specifically, when a discounted cash flow model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected cash flows. Increases in the discount rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment; conversely decreases in the discount rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates an investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks. For certain investments such as warrants, the Company may use an option pricing technique, of which the applicable method is the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Method BSM ), to perform valuations. The BSM is a model of price variation over time of financial instruments, such as equity, that is used to determine the price of call or put options. Various inputs are required but the primary unobservable input into the BSM model is the underlying asset volatility.

per share, of AFT was converted into the right to receive shares of common stock, par value per share, of the Company (with AFT stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company). Pursuant to the AIF Merger Agreement, AIF Merger Sub was first merged with and into AIF, with AIF continuing as the surviving company, and, following the effectiveness of the AIF First Merger, AIF was then merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company. In accordance with the terms of the AIF Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the AIF First Merger, each outstanding share of common stock, par value per share, of AIF was converted into the right to receive shares of common stock, par value per share, of the Company (with AIF stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company). As a result of the Mergers, the Company issued an aggregate of shares of its common stock to former AFT and AIF stockholders. The Mergers were considered asset acquisitions under generally accepted accounting principles with the Company being the accounting survivor. The Mergers were accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting by the Company in accordance with ASC 805. Under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. Per ASC 805-50-30-1, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes transaction costs of the asset acquisition, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of noncash assets given as consideration differs from the assets carrying amounts on the acquiring entity s records. ASC 805-50-30-2 provides that asset acquisitions in which the consideration given is cash are measured by the amount of cash paid. However, if the consideration given is not in the form of cash (that is, in the form of noncash assets, liabilities incurred, or equity interests issued), measurement is based on the cost to the acquiring entity or the fair value of the assets (or net assets) acquired, whichever is more clearly evident and, thus, more reliably measured. The Company determined the fair value of the shares of the Company's common stock that were issued to former AFT and AIF stockholders pursuant to the AFT Merger Agreement and AIF Merger Agreement plus transaction costs to be the consideration paid in connection with the Mergers under ASC 805. The consideration paid to AFT and AIF stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the AFT and AIF assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the purchase discount ). Since the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the merger consideration paid by the Company, the Company recognized a deemed contribution from Investment Adviser.

Borrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) continue to be subject to compliance with a Borrowing Base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company s portfolio.

Overview 
 MidCap Financial Investment Corporation (the Company, MFIC, we, us, or our was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law in February 2004. We have elected to be treated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act ). As such, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70 of our total assets in qualifying assets, including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders. We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 upon completion of our initial public offering that raised 870 million in net proceeds from selling 62 million shares of common stock at a price of 15.00 per share (20.7 million shares at a price of 45.00 per share adjusted for the one-for-three reverse stock split). Since then, and through September 30, 2024, we have raised approximately 2.68 billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and we have repurchased common stock for 248.1 million. 
 On August 1, 2022, the Company changed its name from Apollo Investment Corporation to MidCap Financial Investment Corporation. Our common stock began to trade under the ticker MFIC on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market on August 12, 2022. 
 Apollo Investment Management, L.P. (the Investment Adviser or AIM is our investment adviser and an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries AGM ). The Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors (the Board , manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to the Company. AGM and other affiliates manage other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. AIM and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, AIM may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only in accordance with the terms of the exemptive order (the Order we received from the SEC permitting us to do so. Under the terms of the Order, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must be able to reach certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our Board s approved criteria. In certain situations where co-investment with one or more funds managed by AIM or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, the personnel of AIM or its affiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on allocation policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Order is subject to certain terms and conditions so there can be no assurance that we will be permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates other than in the circumstances currently permitted by regulatory guidance and the Order.

Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the Administrator or AIA ), an affiliate of AGM, provides, among other things, administrative services and facilities for the Company. In addition to furnishing us with office facilities, equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services, AIA also oversees our financial records as well as prepares our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. AIA also performs the calculation and publication of our net asset value, the payment of our expenses and oversees the performance of various third-party service providers and the preparation and filing of our tax returns. Furthermore, AIA provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance. 
 On July 22, 2024, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the AFT Merger Agreement with Apollo Senior Floating Rate Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation AFT ), AFT Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company AFT Merger Sub ), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Investment Adviser, and (ii) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the AIF Merger Agreement and, together with the AFT Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreements with Apollo Tactical Income Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation AIF ), AIF Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company AIF Merger Sub ), and, solely for the limited purposes set forth therein, the Investment Adviser. In connection therewith, AFT and AIF merged with an into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company. For more information on the Mergers, please see Note 10 "Mergers with AFT and AIF" to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Investments 

Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). As of September 30, 2024, non-qualifying assets represented approximately 8.3 of the total assets of the Company. 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital gains, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans, generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark, such as SOFR, the federal funds rate, or the prime rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually and while U.S. subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates, some of our investments may include zero coupon and/or step-up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis. In addition, some of our investments provide for payment-in-kind PIK interest or dividends. Such amounts of accrued PIK interest or dividends are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. We may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and, if applicable, consulting fees, etc.

We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to: 
 investment advisory and management fees; 

expenses incurred by AIM payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies; 

calculation of our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including independent registered public accounting and legal costs; 

costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC; 

interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; 

offerings of our common stock and other securities; 

registration and listing fees; 

fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees;

all other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business, such as our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. 

We expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms. During periods of asset growth, we generally expect our general and administrative operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets and increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive fees, interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities, among others, may also increase or reduce overall operating expenses based on portfolio performance, interest rate benchmarks, and offerings of our securities relative to comparative periods, among other factors.

Recent Developments 
 On October 17, 2024, the Company amended and extended its senior secured, multi-currency, revolving credit facility (the "Amended Senior Secured Facility"). Lender commitments under the Amended Senior Secured Facility will increase from 1.705 billion to 1.815 billion until December 22, 2024 and will decrease to 1.660 billion thereafter. The Amended Senior Secured Facility includes an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the size of the Facility to 2.723 billion. 
 The final maturity date under the Amended Senior Secured Facility for extending lenders was extended by over a year from April 19, 2028 to October 17, 2029. The covenants and representations and warranties the Company is required to comply with were also modified (including, among other things, that the minimum stockholders equity test was reset), but the remaining material business terms and conditions of the Amended Senior Secured Facility remain substantially the same. The Amended Senior Secured Facility continues to include usual and customary events of default for senior secured revolving credit facilities of this type. 
 Borrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility (and the incurrence of certain other permitted debt) continue to be subject to compliance with a Borrowing Base that applies different advance rates to different types of assets in the Company s portfolio. The advance rate applicable to any specific type of asset in the Company s portfolio depends on the relevant asset coverage ratio as of the date of determination. Borrowings under the Amended Senior Secured Facility continue to be subject to the leverage restrictions contained in the 1940 Act. Terms used in this disclosure have the meanings set forth in the Amended Senior Secured Facility. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, credit worthiness of portfolio companies and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition to the discussion below, our significant accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company follows guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 ), where fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are determined within a framework that establishes a three-tier hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable market data and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to establish a classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk, such as the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value using a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs for the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the information available. The inputs or methodology used for valuing assets or liabilities may not be an indication of the risks associated with investing in those assets or liabilities. 
 120 

Table of Contents 

ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. 
 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. The level assigned to the investment valuations may not be indicative of the risk or liquidity associated with investing in such investments. Because of the inherent uncertainties of valuation, the values reflected in the consolidated financial statements may differ materially from the values that would be received upon an actual disposition of such investments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 2.83 billion or 93.6 of the Company s investments were classified as Level 3. The high proportion of Level 3 investments relative to our total investments is directly related to our investment philosophy and target portfolio, which consists primarily of long-term secured debt, as well as unsecured and mezzanine positions of private middle-market companies. A fundamental difference exists between our investments and those of comparable publicly traded fixed income investments, namely high-yield bonds, and this difference affects the valuation of our private investments relative to comparable publicly traded instruments. 
 Senior secured loans, or senior loans, are higher in the capital structure than high-yield bonds, and are typically secured by assets of the borrowing company. This improves their recovery prospects in the event of default and affords senior loans a structural advantage over high-yield bonds. Many of the Company s investments are also privately negotiated and contain covenant protections that limit the issuer to take actions that could harm us as a creditor. High-yield bonds typically do not contain such covenants. 
 Given the structural advantages of capital seniority and covenant protection, the valuation of our private debt portfolio is driven more by investment specific credit factors than movements in the broader debt capital markets. Each security is evaluated individually and as indicated below, we value our private investments based upon a multi-step valuation process, including valuation recommendations from independent valuation firms. 
 121 

Table of Contents 

Investment Valuation Process 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, the Company s Board has designated the Investment Adviser as its valuation designee to perform the fair value determinations for all investments held by the Company. The Company's Board continues to be responsible for overseeing the processes for determining fair valuation. 
 Under the Company's valuation policies and procedures, the Investment Adviser values investments, including certain secured debt, unsecured debt, and other debt securities with maturities greater than 60 days, for which market quotations are readily available, at such market quotations (unless they are deemed not to represent fair value). We attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise from a principal market maker, primary market dealer or other independent pricing service). We utilize mid-market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative. If and when market quotations are unavailable or are deemed not to represent fair value, we typically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value. Accordingly, such investments go through our multi-step valuation process as described below. In each case, our independent third party valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such investments. Investments purchased within the quarter before the valuation date and debt investments with remaining maturities of 60 days or less may each be valued at cost with interest accrued or discount accreted/premium amortized to the date of maturity (although they are typically valued at available market quotations), unless such valuation, in the judgment of our Investment Adviser, does not represent fair value. In this case, such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Investment Adviser, including using market quotations where available. Investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Investment Adviser. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Investment Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 1. Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by using certain inputs provided, among others, by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser who are responsible for the portfolio investment. 

2. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our Investment Adviser. 

3. The Investment Adviser discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in our portfolio based on the input of the applicable independent valuation firm. 

4. For Level 3 investments entered into within the current quarter, the cost (purchase price adjusted for accreted original issue discount/amortized premium) or any recent comparable trade activity on the security investment shall be considered to reasonably approximate the fair value of the investment, provided that no material change has since occurred in the issuer s business, significant inputs or the relevant environment. 

Investments determined by these valuation procedures which have a fair value of less than 1 million during the prior fiscal quarter may be valued based on inputs identified by the Investment Adviser without the necessity of obtaining valuation from an independent valuation firm, if once annually an independent valuation firm using the procedures described herein provides an independent assessment of value. 
 122 

Table of Contents 

Investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, seniority of investment in the investee company s capital structure, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M A comparables, our principal market (as the reporting entity) and enterprise values, among other factors. When readily available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to the Company s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in the valuation process. 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, substantially all of our portfolio investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our investment adviser, as the valuation designee, as described herein. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had an active market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. 
 In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned.

 Total Investment Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The increase in total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by increase in interest income (including PIK) of 13.2 million. The increase in total interest income was due to a higher income-bearing investment portfolio, primarily related to the assets acquired in the mergers with AFT and AIF. This was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield for the total debt portfolio, from 12.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 11.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Further, there was also an increase in other income of 0.7 million due to higher amendment fees.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The increase in total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by increase in interest income (including PIK) of 14.8 million. The increase in total interest income was due to a higher income-bearing investment portfolio, partially related to the assets acquired in the mergers with AFT and AIF. Additionally, prepayment fees and income recognized from the acceleration of discount, premium, or deferred fees on repaid investments increased from 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Net expenses increased by 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the increase in interest and other debt expenses of 5.9 million. The increase in interest and other debt expenses was attributed to an increase in average debt outstanding, from 1.44 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.72 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Further, there was an increase in the total annualized cost of debt, from 7.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.35 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by the decrease of 1.3 million in performance-based incentive fees. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net expenses increased by 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the increase in interest and other debt expenses of 8.5 million. The increase in interest and other debt expenses was attributed to an increase in average debt outstanding, from 1.45 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.51 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Further, there was an increase in the total annualized cost of debt, from 7.02 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 7.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was partially offset by the decrease of 1.6 million in management and performance-based incentive fees (net of amounts waived) due to a decrease in performance based incentive fees. 
 Net Realized Gains (Losses) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gross realized gains of 1.3 million and gross realized losses of 0.8 million, resulting in net realized gains of 0.5 million. Net realized losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were due to a collection of minor individual losses from several portfolio companies and offset by realized gain from sale of Soliant.

 Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gross unrealized gains of 11.6 million and gross unrealized losses of 23.5 million, including the impact of transferring unrealized to realized gains (losses), resulting in net change in unrealized losses of 11.9 million. Net change in unrealized gains (losses) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the conversion of the equity position to debt during the amendment for AVAD, LLC, underperformance of International Cruise Excursion Gallery, Inc., and US Auto, and the sale of Soliant.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s liquidity and capital resources are generated and generally available through periodic follow-on equity and debt offerings, our Senior Secured Facility (as defined in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements), our senior secured notes, our senior unsecured notes, investments in special purpose entities in which we hold and finance particular investments on a non-recourse basis, as well as from cash flows from operations, investment sales of liquid assets and repayments of senior and subordinated loans and income earned from investments. 
 We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our short-term investments, proceeds from the sale of our 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes and Bethesda CLO 1, our available borrowing capacity under our Senior Secured Facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next twelve months. 
 Cash Equivalents 
 The Company defines cash equivalents as securities that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only securities with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase would qualify, with limited exceptions. The Company deems that certain money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other high-quality, short-term debt securities would qualify as cash equivalents (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements) At the end of each fiscal quarter, we consider taking proactive steps utilizing cash equivalents with the objective of enhancing our investment flexibility during the following quarter, pursuant to Section 55 of the 1940 Act. More specifically, we may purchase U.S. Treasury bills from time-to-time on the last business day of the quarter and typically close out that position on the following business day, settling the sale transaction on a net cash basis with the purchase, subsequent to quarter end. The Company may also utilize repurchase agreements or other balance sheet transactions, including drawing down on our Senior Secured Facility, as we deem appropriate. 
 Debt 
 See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company s debt.

Stockholders Equity 
 See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company s public offerings and share repurchase plans. 
 Equity Issuances 
 We may from time to time issue and sell shares of our common stock through public or at-the-market ("ATM offerings. On August 13, 2024, we entered into (i) an equity distribution agreement by and among us, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator and Truist Securities, Inc. Truist and (ii) an equity distribution agreement by and among us, the Investment Adviser, the Administrator and Jefferies LLC Jefferies, and together with Truist, the Sales Agents ). The equity distribution agreements with Sales Agents described in the preceding sentence are collectively referred to herein as the Equity Distribution Agreements. For further details regarding the Equity Distribution Agreements, see Note 7 "Stockholders Equity Equity Issuances At-the-market ATM Offering to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Distributions 
 Distributions paid to stockholders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 54.4 million 0.58 per share) and 104.0 million 1.34 per share) which includes 18.8 million special distribution 0.20 per share), respectively. Distributions paid to stockholders during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 24.8 million 0.38 per share) and 74.5 million 1.14 per share), respectively. For income tax purposes, distributions made to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital, or a combination thereof. Although the tax character of distributions paid to stockholders through September 30, 2024 may include return of capital, the exact amount cannot be determined at this point. The final determination of the tax character of distributions will not be made until we file our tax return for the tax year ended December 31, 2024. Tax characteristics of all distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099 after the end of the calendar year. Our quarterly distributions, if any, will be determined by our Board. 
 To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute at least 90 of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, out of the assets legally available for distribution. Although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains (i.e., net long-term capital gains in excess of short-term capital losses), if any, at least annually, out of the assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains 
 129 

Table of Contents 

for investment. Currently, we have substantial net capital loss carryforwards and consequently do not expect to generate cumulative net capital gains in the foreseeable future. 
 We maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend, then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends. 
 We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions or fail to satisfy certain other conditions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we may suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a RIC. In addition, in accordance with GAAP and tax regulations, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual PIK, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may not be able to meet the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC. 
 With respect to the distributions to stockholders, income from origination, structuring, closing, commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly, distributed to stockholders. 
 PIK Income 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, PIK income totaled 3.0 million and 7.5 million on total investment income of 82.1 million and 219.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, PIK income totaled 0.5 million and 2.1 million on total investment income of 68.2 million and 204.6 million, respectively. In order to maintain the Company s status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of distributions, even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the Company s PIK income. 
 Related Party Transactions 
 See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Company s related party transactions. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio. 
 
 Investment valuation risk 
 Because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio, we value all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board based on, among other things, the input of our management and audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our Board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation (with certain de minimis exceptions). Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on 
 130

these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Fair Value Measurements as well as Notes 2 and 5 to our financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for more information relating to our investment valuation . 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the majority of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates, which generally are SOFR-based (or based on an equivalent applicable currency rate) and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates, and many of which are subject to certain floors. Further, our Senior Secured Facility and Class A-1 Notes under the CLO bears interest at SOFR rates with no interest rate floors, while our 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes bears interest at a fixed rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 The following table shows the estimated annual impact on net investment income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate flows for variable rate instruments) to our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 

Basis Point Change

We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time-to-time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this report), we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management has not identified any change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While we do not expect that the resolution of these matters if they arise would materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, resolution will be subject to various uncertainties and could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. 
 
 On March 14, 2023, certain First Lien and Second Lien holders of debt issued by Mitel filed a complaint in New York State Court captioned Ocean Trails CLO VII et al v. MLN TopCo Ltd., et al, Index No. 651327/2023, against certain other First Lien and Second Lien debt holders, including AFT and AIF, alleging, among other things, that the defendant lenders breached the terms of their lending agreements and the New York Uniform Voidable Transfer Act in connection with certain amendments to the relevant documents governing the debt. Plaintiffs seek to have the amendments in question declared void. On December 5, 2023, the trial court granted defendants motions to dismiss in part and denied them in part. The trial matter is currently in discovery. The plaintiffs and defendants have also taken interlocutory appeals of the courts motion to dismiss ruling to the intermediate New York State appellate court, which are pending. No reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time. 
 Other than the matter disclosed above, we are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge are any material legal proceedings threatened against us.
