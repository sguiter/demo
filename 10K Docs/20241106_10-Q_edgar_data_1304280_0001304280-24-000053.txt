 ownership. Our joint venture partner is Tri-Arrows. Logan processes metal received from Novelis and Tri-Arrows and charges the respective partner a fee to cover expenses. Logan is a thinly capitalized VIE that relies on the regular reimbursement of costs and expenses from Novelis and Tri-Arrows to fund its operations. Novelis is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates Logan since it has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact Logan's economic performance, an obligation to absorb expected losses, and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
 Other than the contractually required reimbursements, we do not provide additional material support to Logan. Logan's creditors do not have recourse to our general credit. There are significant other assets used in the operations of Logan that are not part of the joint venture, as they are directly owned and consolidated by Novelis or Tri-Arrows.

 UAL 
 UAL is a joint venture investment between Novelis Korea Ltd., a subsidiary of Novelis, and Kobe. UAL is a thinly capitalized VIE that relies on the regular reimbursement of costs and expenses from Novelis and Kobe. UAL is controlled by an equally represented board of directors in which neither entity has sole decision-making ability regarding production operations or other significant decisions. Furthermore, neither entity has the ability to take the majority share of production or associated costs over the life of the joint venture. Our risk of loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment in and inventory-related receivables from UAL. UAL's creditors do not have recourse to our general credit. Therefore, UAL is accounted for as an equity method investment, and Novelis is not considered the primary beneficiary. UAL currently produces flat-rolled aluminum products exclusively for Novelis and Kobe. As of September 30, 2024, Novelis and Kobe both hold a interest in UAL. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we made additional contributions to UAL in the amount of million and million, respectively.

 Price risk exposure arises due to the timing lag between the LME based pricing of raw material aluminum purchases and the LME based pricing of finished product sales. We identify and designate certain LME aluminum forward sales contracts as cash flow hedges of the metal price risk associated with our future metal sales that vary based on changes in the price of aluminum. Generally, such designated exposures do not extend beyond in length. The average duration of those contracts is less than . 
 In addition to aluminum, we entered into LME copper and zinc forward contracts, as well as LMP forward contracts. As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, the fair value of these contracts represented a liability of million and a liability of million, respectively.

 Foreign Currency 
 We use foreign exchange forward contracts and cross-currency swaps to manage our exposure to changes in exchange rates. These exposures arise from recorded assets and liabilities, firm commitments, and forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain operations. 
 We use foreign currency contracts to hedge expected future foreign currency transactions, which include capital expenditures. These contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures. We had total notional amounts of billion in outstanding foreign currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024. 
 During the current fiscal year, we entered into forward contracts to hedge our investments in our European operations. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is included in Other comprehensive income (loss) under Currency translation adjustments. The excluded portion of gain or loss on derivatives is included in other expenses (income), net. We had a total notional amount of million in outstanding foreign currency forwards designated as net investment hedges as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, we had outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts with a total notional amount of billion and billion, respectively, to primarily hedge balance sheet remeasurement risk, which were not designated as hedges. Contracts representing the majority of this notional amount will mature by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and offset the remeasurement impact.

 On June 30, 2024, our plant located in Sierre, Switzerland was impacted by exceptional flooding caused by unprecedented heavy rainfall. There were no injuries, as all employees were safely evacuated; however, water entered the plant premises and plant operations were halted. As a result of this event, the Company recognized fixed asset charges of million and inventory charges of million during the six months ended September 30, 2024, with million of inventory charges recorded during three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred costs resulting from the shut down of the facility and efforts to restore operations, including idle fixed costs of million, repairs and clean-up costs of million, excess costs to fulfill customer contracts of million, and other costs of million. As we continue to assess the physical condition of the plant's assets and continue the efforts to restore operations, we may incur additional losses in future periods. The plant is insured for property damage and business interruption losses related to such events, subject to deductibles and policy limits. We will record an insurance receivable based on the anticipated insurance proceeds when the potential insurance proceeds can be reliably estimated.

 million. This amount included gross deferred tax assets of approximately billion and a valuation allowance of million. It is reasonably possible that our estimates of future taxable income may change within the next twelve months resulting in a change to the valuation allowance in one or more jurisdictions. 
 Tax Uncertainties 
 Certain tax filings for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2022 are subject to tax examinations and judicial and administrative proceedings. As a result of further settlement of audits, judicial decisions, the filing of amended tax returns, or the expiration of statutes of limitations, our reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, as well as reserves for interest and penalties, may change in the next 12 months. With few exceptions, tax returns for all jurisdictions for all tax years before fiscal 2007 are no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities or subject to any judicial or administrative proceedings. In August 2024, we received a final tax assessment for the fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2016 tax audit in Germany. Upon receipt of the final tax assessments, we filed an appeal and began the process to request a mutual agreement procedure in those jurisdictions for which there would be an offsetting benefit for the amounts paid to Germany. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, certain other estimates and assumptions associated with uncertain tax positions also changed. changes to uncertain tax positions during the three months ended September 30, 2024, including as a result of the final Germany tax assessments, had a material impact on our financial statements for any periods presented.

 to million. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information. The Company's estimates involve significant judgment. Therefore, the estimate will change from time to time and actual losses may differ from the current estimate. We review the status of, and estimated liability related to, pending claims and civil actions on a quarterly basis. The evaluation model includes all asserted and unasserted claims that can be reasonably identified, including claims relating to our responsibility for compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or formerly operated. The estimated costs in respect of such reported liabilities are not offset by amounts related to insurance or indemnification arrangements unless otherwise noted. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We have established liabilities based on our estimates for currently anticipated costs associated with environmental matters. We estimate that the costs related to our environmental liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, were million and million, respectively. Of the total million as of September 30, 2024, million is associated with an environmental reserve, million is associated with undiscounted environmental clean-up costs, and million is associated with restructuring actions. As of September 30, 2024, million is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the remainder is within other long-term liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Brazilian Tax Litigation 
 Under a federal tax dispute settlement program established by the Brazilian government, we have settled several disputes with Brazil's tax authorities regarding various forms of manufacturing taxes and social security contributions. In most cases, we are paying the settlement amounts over a period of 180 months, however, in some cases we pay the settlement amounts over a shorter period. Total settlement liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, were million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the million is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 In addition to the disputes we have settled under the federal tax dispute settlement program, we are involved in several other unresolved tax and other legal claims in Brazil. Total liabilities for other disputes and claims were million as of September 30, 2024, and million as of March 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the million is included within other long-term liabilities in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we have included in the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed above any unresolved tax disputes or other contingencies for which a loss is reasonably possible and estimable. The interest cost recorded on these settlement liabilities offset by interest earned on the cash deposits is reported in other expenses (income), net on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 During prior fiscal years, we received multiple favorable rulings from the Brazilian court that recognized the right to exclude certain taxes from the tax base used to calculate contributions to the social integration program and social security contributions on gross revenues, also known as PIS and COFINS. As a result of these cases, we had the right to apply for tax credits for the amounts overpaid during specified tax years. These credits and corresponding interest could be used to offset various Brazilian federal taxes in future years. 
 The credit amounts, interest calculation, and supporting documentation are subject to further validation and scrutiny by tax authorities for five years after the credits are utilized. Thus, credits recognized may differ from these amounts. 
 In order to qualify for these credits, the Company is required to compile and present verifiable support validating the credits. During fiscal 2022, Novelis applied for and received official authorization from The Special Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil ("Receita Federal") to use the PIS and COFINS credits related to certain periods. Novelis was able to utilize a majority of these credits to offset taxes paid in fiscal 2022 and utilized the remaining credits in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Novelis received a tax notification on July 11, 2024 requesting information for the calculated credits of COFINS in the amount of million, related to the period from 2008 to 2014, and PIS and COFINS in the amount of million, related to the period from 2015 to 2017. If the credits are not sufficiently validated per the request, a portion of the COFINS and PIS and COFINS credits may be disallowed. The Company believes it has sufficient documentation to support the use of the credits.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 The following information should be read together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below, particularly in SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND MARKET DATA . 
 
 OVERVIEW AND REFERENCES 
 In this Form 10-Q, unless otherwise specified, the terms "we," "our," "us," the "Company," and "Novelis" refer to Novelis Inc., a company incorporated in Canada under the Canadian Business Corporations Act, and its subsidiaries. References herein to "Hindalco" refer to Hindalco Industries Limited, which acquired Novelis in May 2007. 
 Novelis is driven by its purpose of shaping a sustainable world together. We consider ourselves a global leader in the production of innovative, sustainable aluminum solutions and the world's largest recycler of aluminum. Specifically, we believe we are the leading provider of low-carbon aluminum solutions, helping to drive a circular economy by partnering with our suppliers and customers in beverage packaging, automotive, aerospace and specialties (a diverse market including building construction, signage, foil packaging, commercial transportation, and commercial consumer products, among others) markets globally. Throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and South America, we have an integrated network of 31 world-class, technologically advanced facilities, including 14 recycling centers and 11 innovation centers. Novelis is a subsidiary of Hindalco, an industry leader in aluminum and copper and the metals flagship company of the Adity a Birla Group, a multinational conglomerate based in Mumbai, India. 
 As used in this Form 10-Q, consolidated "aluminum rolled product shipments," "flat-rolled product shipments," or "shipments" refer to aluminum rolled product shipments to third parties. Regional "aluminum rolled product shipments," "flat-rolled product shipments," or "shipments" refer to aluminum rolled product shipments to third parties and intersegment shipments to other Novelis regions. Shipment amounts also include tolling shipments. References to "total shipments" include aluminum rolled product shipments as well as certain other non-rolled product shipments, primarily scrap, UBCs, ingots, billets, and primary remelt. The term "aluminum rolled products" is synonymous with the terms "flat-rolled products" and "FRP," which are commonly used by manufacturers and third-party analysts in our industry. All tonnages are stated in metric tonnes. One metric tonne is equivalent to 2,204.6 pounds. One kt is 1,000 metric tonnes. 
 
 BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY CLIMATE 
 For over a decade, Novelis has been pursuing a strategy to transform and improve the profitability of our business through significant investment in new capacity and capabilities. These investments enabled us to increase the amount of recycled content in our products; capitalize on favorable long-term market trends driving increased consumer demand for lightweight, sustainable aluminum products; and diversify and optimize our product portfolio. As a global leader in the aluminum flat-rolled products industry, we leveraged our new capacity, global footprint, scale, and solid customer relationships to drive volumes and capture favorable supply and demand market dynamics across all our end-use markets. With growth in volumes combined with improved pricing, significant increase in scrap inputs, operational efficiencies, and high-capacity utilization rates, we significantly improved the profitability of our beverage packaging and specialties products and maintained high margins for automotive and aerospace products since launching this strategy. 
 However, fiscal 2023 and 2024 were challenged by high inflation, geopolitical instability in Europe, and rising interest rates. These factors led to increased global operating costs, including for energy, freight, labor, coatings, and alloys; increased interest expense on our variable interest rate loans; and softer demand in some specialty end markets, such as building and construction, which is more sensitive to inflation and interest rates. We also saw reduced can sheet demand beginning in the second half of fiscal 2023 attributed to the beverage packaging industry reducing excess inventory as supply chains improved and markets adjusted to a more moderated level of beverage packaging demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent quarters, competition for scrap metal has been increasing due to strong consumer demand for aluminum rolled products made from high amounts of recycled content (or scrap), a growing focus on carbon emission reduction, and the favorable economics that may be achieved by efficiently consuming scrap inputs compared to prime metal inputs. Intensifying competition for scrap aluminum and liberalization of scrap importation policies in China create significant pressure on scrap pricing and reduce the financial benefit from utilizing scrap in our production process. 
 35 

Many of the operating costs pressures seen in fiscal 2023 and 2024 have lessened in recent quarters, and we have been able to pass through a portion of those higher costs to customers through price increases. We also believe inventory levels across the beverage packaging supply chain have now largely normalized and demand for beverage packaging sheet is strong. With respect to the scrap supply and demand imbalances, we are working on solutions to increase the amount and different types of scrap metal our systems are able to process, including sorting technologies and supply chain improvements. However, until these improvements can be scaled, we believe the lower availability and higher prices of scrap will increase our production costs in the near-term. 
 We believe that global long-term demand for aluminum rolled products remains strong, driven by anticipated economic growth, material substitution, and sustainability considerations, including increased environmental awareness around PET plastics. 
 Increasing customer preference for sustainable packaging options, and package mix shift toward infinitely recyclable aluminum are driving higher demand for aluminum beverage packaging worldwide. To support growing demand for aluminum beverage packaging sheet in North America, we broke ground on a 600 kt capacity greenfield rolling and recycling plant in Bay Minette, Alabama, in October 2022. We plan to initially allocate approximately two-thirds of this plant's capacity to the production of beverage packaging sheet, with the remaining capacity targeted primarily for the automotive market. We continue to evaluate opportunities for additional capacity expansion across regions where local can sheet supply is insufficient to meet long-term demand growth and assess our capital expenditure plans in light of developments impacting our business. In September 2024, we determined not to pursue previously announced plans for a 375 million investment to expand operations in Zhenjiang, China. 
 We believe that long-term demand for aluminum automotive sheet will continue to grow, primarily driven by the benefits that result from using lightweight aluminum in vehicle structures and components, as automakers respond to stricter government regulations regarding emissions and fuel economy, while maintaining or improving vehicle safety and performance. We are also seeing increased demand for aluminum for electric vehicles, as aluminum's lighter weight can result in extended battery range. 
 We expect long-term demand for building and construction and other specialty products to grow due to increased customer preference for lightweight, sustainable materials. 
 Demand for aerospace aluminum plate and sheet has strengthened as air-travel demand has recovered above pre-COVID levels. In the longer-term, we believe significant aircraft industry order backlogs for key OEMs, including Airbus and Boeing, will translate into growth in the future and that our multi-year supply agreements have positioned us to benefit from future expected demand. 
 We believe the long-term demand trends for flat-rolled aluminum products remain strong, and we have approximately 5 billion of debottlenecking, recycling, and new capacity capital investments under way, focused on increasing capacity and capabilities to meet growing customer demand. This estimated capital investment spend includes the aforementioned Bay Minette plant and a new 90 million recycling expansion in Latchford, UK, announced in July 2024. The estimated capital investment spend also includes 365 million for a highly advanced automotive recycling center in Guthrie, Kentucky, which began commissioning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Our management administers an ERM program, which is a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation process that identifies and addresses all known current and potential material risks to Novelis' global operations, including legal and regulatory risks. The ERM team is led by an executive officer who delivers an ERM report to the Audit Committee of our Board at least quarterly. On an annual basis, the ERM team meets with or interviews about 160 individuals, some of which are interviewed quarterly, to stay abreast of the latest risks we face. 
 Throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict, our ERM team has monitored developments and gathered information about Novelis relationships with Russian businesses. Novelis' direct exposure to the conflict has been limited, as we have no operations, assets, or employees in either Russia or Ukraine, and we have only immaterial customer relationships in these countries. Sanctions, tariffs, a ban or similar actions impacting the supply of Russian aluminum could disrupt global aluminum supply. While one of our suppliers of metal is UC Rusal PLC ("Rusal"), a Russian aluminum company, we purchase metal from a diverse global portfolio of metal suppliers and are not dependent on Rusal for a significant portion of our metal supply. The ERM team also monitors other potential impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including impacts on the reliability of energy supplies to our European manufacturing sites and supply chain disruptions. This information is presented to, and discussed with, the Audit Committee of our Board at least quarterly, with interim updates from our executive leadership as our Board may require. In addition, we manage sanctions compliance through a global sanctions screening program, and our Information Security team monitors cybersecurity matters and makes periodic reports at meetings of our Board.

On June 30, 2024, our plant located in Sierre, Switzerland was impacted by exceptional flooding caused by unprecedented heavy rainfall. All employees were safely evacuated; however, water entered the plant premises and plant operations were halted. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized charges of 101 million resulting from this event, including fixed asset and inventory charges, idle fixed costs, repairs and clean-up costs, and excess costs to fulfill customer contracts. The plant is insured for property damage and business interruption losses related to such events, subject to deductibles and policy limits. We will record an insurance receivable based on the anticipated insurance proceeds when the potential insurance proceeds can be reliably estimated. Production at the facility has been partially restored at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and is expected to return to normal production capability in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We estimate the total net cash impact from this event, after insurance, to be 80 million. The net impact on Adjusted EBITDA from this event is estimated to be 30 million, the majority of which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. See Note 13 Other Expenses (Income), Net to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information about this event. 
 Environmental, Social Governance 
 We maintain our aim to become a carbon neutral company by 2050 or sooner. Our recently announced 2030 goals aim to have less than 3 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per tonne of rolled product shipments; and aim to push the boundaries on recycled content in our products by increasing average recycled content to 75 , from today's 63 , both by the end of calendar year 2030. Carbon goals are inclusive of Scope 1 and 2, as well as Scope 3 emissions in categories 1 and 4 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. In addition, we have targets to reduce waste intensity to landfills by 20 , energy intensity by 10 , and water intensity by 10 , each by fiscal 2026, from our baseline of fiscal 2020. 
 To increase the use of recycled content in our products, we engage with customers, suppliers, and industry peers across the value chain as we aim to drive innovation that improves aluminum's overall sustainability profile. 
 In support of our commitments, we voluntarily pursued the Aluminum Stewardship Initiatives' ("ASI") certification program at 22 plants globally, and 14 scrap collection centers across Brazil, with both the Performance Standard Certification and the Chain of Custody Certification. ASI works together with producers, users, and stakeholders in the aluminum value chain to collaboratively foster responsible production, sourcing, and stewardship of aluminum. In addition, to support our initiatives, in March 2021 we issued 500 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We have allocated an amount equal to the net proceeds of 588 million of these notes to eligible "green" projects, such as investments in renewable energy and pollution prevention and control projects. 
 Our path to a more sustainable and circular future goes beyond our environmental commitments. Across the four continents on which Novelis operates there are diverse cultures and many unique perspectives. By building a culture in which employees are encouraged to be their authentic selves, supported by an environment of respect and appreciation, and given opportunities to learn, grow and thrive, we believe we are creating fertile ground for innovation and self-development. 
 We are also committed to supporting the communities in which our employees live and work. With firmly established community engagement programs, the Company is committed to advancing its corporate social responsibility efforts by further investing in the Novelis Neighbor program, which gives back to communities through financial contributions and employee volunteerism. The programs emphasize STEM education, recycling education, and addressing local community needs. 
 Liquidity Position 
 We believe we have adequate liquidity to manage the business with dynamic metal prices. Our cash and cash equivalents and availability under committed credit facilities aggregated to 2.1 billion of liquidity as of September 30, 2024. 
 We maintain a disciplined approach to capital spending, prioritizing maintenance capital for our operations, and organic strategic capacity expansion projects. We are taking a prudent approach to phasing the timing of transformational organic investment spend, and we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 expected to be on the lower end of the range of 1.8 to 2.1 billion, as spending for a number of announced strategic capital projects is now ramping up. This includes approximately 300 million for expected maintenance spend.

Market Trends 
 Beverage Packaging. Can stock shipments represent the largest percentage of our total rolled product shipments. According to CRU, demand for can stock will increase at a global (excluding China) compound annual growth rate of approximately 4 from calendar year 2023 to 2031, mainly driven by sustainability trends; growth in beverage markets that increasingly use aluminum packaging; and substitution from plastic, glass, and steel. However, we saw reduced can sheet demand between the middle of fiscal 2023 through early fiscal 2024 attributed to the beverage packaging industry reducing excess inventory previously stocked in response to unreliable supply chains and unprecedented high levels of beverage packaging demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as low promotional activity at retailers. We believe that inventory levels in the supply chain and demand for beverage packaging has now largely normalized. Increased demand for sustainable, aluminum beverage packaging sheet has also increased the demand for, and price of, scrap metal inputs, particularly UBC scrap. Furthermore, UBC scrap availability in the US is affected by low recycling rates and an increase in its exports, including to China. 
 We are working on solutions to increase the amount and different types of scrap our systems are able to process, including sorting technologies and supply chain improvements. However, until these improvements can be scaled, we believe the lower availability and higher prices of scrap will increase our production costs in the near-term. 
 Automotive. We believe aluminum is positioned for long-term growth driven by increased adoption of aluminum in vehicle structures and components of both traditional internal combustible engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles, which utilize higher amounts of aluminum. Based on management estimates, we believe that global automotive aluminum sheet demand is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6 from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2030. 
 Aerospace. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported 2024 global air traffic surpassed 2019 levels, reaching a full recovery post-pandemic. We expect demand for aerospace aluminum plate and sheet to continue to grow driven by increased air traffic and a need for fleet modernization. 
 Specialties. Specialties includes diverse markets, including building and construction, commercial transportation, foil and packaging, and commercial and consumer products. These industries continue to increase aluminum adoption due to its many desirable characteristics. We believe these trends will keep demand high in the long-term, despite the near-term economic headwinds impacting demand for building and construction and some industrial products. 
 
 BUSINESS MODEL AND KEY CONCEPTS 
 Conversion Business Model 
 A significant amount of our business is conducted under a conversion model, which allows us to pass through increases or decreases in the price of aluminum to our customers. Nearly all of our flat-rolled products have a price structure with three components: (i) a base aluminum price quoted off the LME; (ii) an LMP; and (iii) a "conversion premium" to produce the rolled product that reflects, among other factors, the competitive market conditions for that product. Base aluminum prices are typically driven by macroeconomic factors and global supply and demand for aluminum. LMP tends to vary based on the supply and demand for metal in a particular region and the associated transportation costs. 
 LME Base Aluminum Prices and Local Market Premiums 
 The average (based on the simple average of the monthly averages) and closing prices for aluminum set on the LME are as follows.

Metal Price Lag and Related Hedging Activities 
 Increases or decreases in the price of aluminum based on the average LME base aluminum prices and LMPs directly impact net sales, cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), and working capital. The timing of these impacts varies based on contractual arrangements with customers and metal suppliers in each region. These timing impacts are referred to as metal price lag. Metal price lag exists due to: (i) the period of time between the pricing of our purchase of metal, holding and processing the metal, and the pricing of the sale of finished inventory to our customers and (ii) certain customer contracts containing fixed forward price commitments, which result in exposure to changes in metal prices for the period of time between when our sales price fixes and the sale actually occurs. 
 We use LME aluminum forward contracts to preserve our conversion margins and manage the timing differences associated with the LME base metal component of net sales and cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). These derivatives directly hedge the economic risk of future LME base metal price fluctuations to better match the purchase price of metal with the sales price of metal. We have exposure to multiple regional LMPs, however the derivative markets for local market premiums is not robust or efficient enough for us to offset the impacts of LMP price movements beyond a small volume. From time to time, we take advantage of short-term market conditions to hedge a small percentage of our exposure. As a consequence, volatility in local market premiums can have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows. 
 We elect to apply hedge accounting to better match the recognition of gains or losses on certain derivative instruments with the recognition of the underlying exposure being hedged in the statement of operations. For undesignated metal derivatives, there are timing differences between the recognition of unrealized gains or losses on the derivatives and the recognition of the underlying exposure in the statement of operations. The recognition of unrealized gains and losses on undesignated metal derivative positions typically precedes inventory cost recognition, customer delivery, and revenue recognition. The timing difference between the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on undesignated metal derivatives and cost or revenue recognition impacts income before income tax provision and net income. 
 Foreign Currency and Related Hedging Activities 
 We operate a global business and conduct business in various currencies around the world. We have exposure to foreign currency risk as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates impact our operating results as we translate the operating results from various functional currencies into our U.S. dollar reporting currency at current average rates. We also record foreign exchange remeasurement gains and losses when business transactions are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of that operation. Global economic uncertainty is contributing to higher levels of volatility among the currency pairs in which we conduct business. The following table presents the exchange rates as of the end of each period and the average of the month-end exchange rates.

 Exchange rate movements have an impact on our operating results. In Europe, where we have predominantly local currency selling prices and operating costs, we benefit as the euro strengthens but are adversely affected as the euro weakens. For our Swiss operations, where operating costs are incurred primarily in the Swiss franc and a large portion of revenues are denominated in the euro, we benefit as the Swiss franc weakens but are adversely affected as the franc strengthens. In South Korea, where we have local currency operating costs and U.S. dollar denominated selling prices for exports, we benefit as the South Korean won weakens but are adversely affected as the won strengthens. In Brazil, where we have predominately U.S. dollar selling prices and local currency manufacturing costs, we benefit as the Brazilian real weakens but are adversely affected as the real strengthens. We use foreign exchange forward contracts and cross-currency swaps to manage our exposure arising from recorded assets and liabilities, firm commitments, and forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain operations, which include capital expenditures and net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income attributable to our common shareholder of 128 million, a decrease of 18 compared to 157 million in the comparable prior year period, and total Adjusted EBITDA of 462 million, a decrease of 5 compared to 484 million in the comparable prior year period. The decrease in operational performance compared to the comparable prior year period was primarily driven by a relatively rapid increase in scrap prices creating a less favorable metal benefit compared to the prior year and unfavorable product mix from lower automotive shipments globally, including impacts associated with production interruptions at our Sierre, Switzerland plant. These headwinds were partially offset by higher beverage packaging shipments. Net income attributable to our common shareholder was further negatively impacted by charges associated with the impact of flooding at our Sierre, Switzerland plant. 
 
 For the six months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income attributable to our common shareholder of 279 million, a decrease of 11 compared to 313 million in the comparable prior year period, and total Adjusted EBITDA of 962 million, an increase of 6 compared to 905 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in operational performance was primarily driven by higher beverage packaging shipments and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable product mix including the impact of lower automotive shipments, less favorable metal benefit from higher scrap pricing, and higher operating cost. Net income attributable to our common shareholder was further negatively impacted by charges associated with the impact of flooding at our Sierre, Switzerland plant.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales was 4.3 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5 from 4.1 billion in the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an 1 increase in rolled product shipments and higher average aluminum prices driven by an 11 increase in average LME prices. The main drivers for the movement in shipments are discussed below under Segment Review . 
 Income before income tax provision was 180 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 13 from 208 million in the comparable prior year period. In addition to the factors noted above, the following items affected income before income tax provision. 
 Cost of Goods Sold (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 3.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4 from 3.5 billion in the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the increase in shipments and higher average aluminum prices. Total metal input costs included in cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased 105 million over the comparable prior year period.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A was 183 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was largely consistent with the comparable prior year period. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization was 141 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4 from 136 million in the comparable prior year period. 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs 
 Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs was 72 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 8 from 78 million in the comparable prior year period. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net 
 We recorded a 5 million loss on extinguishment of debt, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This loss was related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount for the partial extinguishment of the 2020 Term Loan. There were no losses on extinguishments of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Restructuring and Impairment Expenses (Reversals), Net 
 Restructuring and impairment expenses, net was a net expense of 21 million and 4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The change primarily relates to a charge of 17 million to write off previously capitalized costs. 
 Other Expense (Income), Net 
 Other expenses (income), net was an expense of 65 million and income of 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The change relates primarily to charges of 61 million related to the Sierre flood. 
 Taxes 
 We recognized 51 million of income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In the current period, our effective tax rate was primarily driven by the full-year forecasted effective tax rate that takes into account income taxed at rates that differ from the 25 Canadian rate, including withholding taxes, and changes to the Brazilian real foreign exchange rate, offset by the availability of tax credits and changes in uncertain tax positions. 
 Due in part to the regional nature of supply and demand of aluminum rolled products and in order to best serve our customers, we manage our activities on the basis of geographical regions and are organized under four operating segments: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. 
 The tables below illustrate selected segment financial information (in millions, except shipments, which are in kt). For additional financial information related to our operating segments including the reconciliation of net income attributable to our common shareholder to Adjusted EBITDA, see Note 16 Segment, Geographical Area, Major Customer and Major Supplier Information . In order to reconcile the financial information for the segments shown in the tables below to the relevant U.S. GAAP-based measures, "Eliminations and other" must adjust for proportional consolidation of each line item for our Logan affiliate because we consolidate 100 of the Logan joint venture for U.S. GAAP purposes. However, we manage our Logan affiliate on a proportionately consolidated basis and eliminate intersegment shipments.

 (1) The recognition of Adjusted EBITDA by a region on an intersegment shipment could occur in a period prior to the recognition of Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, depending on the timing of when the inventory is sold to a third-party customer. The "Eliminations and other" column adjusts regional Adjusted EBITDA for intersegment shipments that occur in a period prior to recognition of Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The "Eliminations and other" column also reflects adjustments for changes in regional volume, conversion premium and product mix, and conversion costs related to intersegment shipments for consolidation. "Eliminations and other" must adjust for proportional consolidation of each line item for our Logan affiliate because we consolidate 100 of the Logan joint venture for U.S. GAAP, but we manage our Logan affiliate on a proportionately consolidated basis. 
 (2) Selling, general administrative and research development costs include costs incurred directly by each segment and all corporate related costs. 
 North America 
 Net sales increased 60 million, or 3 , primarily driven by higher average LME aluminum prices and a 2 increase in rolled product shipments, driven by higher beverage packaging shipments. Higher beverage packaging shipments were partially offset by lower specialty and automotive shipments. Adjusted EBITDA was 185 million, a decrease of 11 , primarily driven by less favorable product mix and lower metal benefit from higher scrap pricing, as well as higher labor cost, partially offset by higher volume and product pricing. 
 Europe 
 Net sales decreased 36 million, or 3 , primarily driven by lower automotive shipments due to production interruptions at the Sierre, Switzerland plant due to flooding, partially offset by higher average LME aluminum prices. Adjusted EBITDA was 63 million, a decrease of 37 , primarily driven by production interruptions at the Sierre, Switzerland plant and less favorable metal benefits from higher scrap pricing. 
 Asia 
 Net sales increased 149 million, or 23 , primarily driven by a 13 increase in rolled product shipments and higher average LME aluminum prices. The increase in shipments was driven mainly by higher beverage packaging shipments to support demand in North America, as well as higher automotive shipments and aerospace shipments, partially offset by lower specialty shipments. Adjusted EBITDA was 91 million, an increase of 11 , primarily driven by higher volume, partially offset by less favorable metal benefits from higher scrap pricing, and higher energy and labor costs. Additionally, we incurred higher freight costs compared to the prior year period, which in turn resulted in a higher freight cost pass-through in price to customers. 
 42 

South America 
 Net sales increased 79 million, or 13 , primarily driven by a 13 increase in rolled product shipments driven by higher beverage packaging shipments and higher average LME aluminum prices. Adjusted EBITDA was 122 million, an increase of 31 , primarily driven by higher volume, higher product pricing, and favorable product mix. 
 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Six Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales were 8.5 billion for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3 from 8.2 billion in the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a 5 increase in rolled product shipments and higher average aluminum prices driven by an 11 increase in average LME prices, partially offset by metal price hedging activities with an unfavorable period-on-period impact of 222 million. The main drivers for the increase in shipments are discussed below under Segment Review . 
 Income before income tax provision was 390 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 418 million in the comparable prior year period. In addition to the factors noted above, the following items affected income before income tax provision. 
 Cost of Goods Sold (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization) 
 Cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was 7.1 billion for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2 from 7.0 billion in the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by higher average aluminum prices and higher production. Total metal input costs included in cost of goods sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased 49 million over the comparable prior year period. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A was 364 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2 from 356 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase is mainly due to higher employment expense resulting from higher employment and variable compensation costs. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization was 281 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5 from 267 million in the comparable prior year period. 
 Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs 
 Interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs was 144 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7 from 155 million in the comparable prior year period. This decrease is primarily due to lower average interest rates on variable interest rate borrowings and higher capitalized interest. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net 
 We recorded a 5 million loss on extinguishment of debt, net for the six months ended September 30, 2023. This relates to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discount for the partial extinguishment of the 2020 Term Loan. There were no losses on extinguishments of debt for the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Restructuring and Impairment Expenses, Net 
 Restructuring and impairment expenses, net was a net expense of 40 million and 7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The change primarily relates to the Company's closure of the Buckhannon, West Virginia plant in June 2024, which resulted in charges for restructuring activities of 19 million in the current period, as well as a charge of 17 million to write off previously capitalized costs. 
 Other (Income) Expenses, Net 
 Other expenses (income), net was an expense of 125 million and income of 29 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The change relates primarily to charges of 101 million related to the Sierre flood and the Company incurring realized losses on the change in fair value of derivative instruments, net, of 32 million in the current period compared to gains of 49 million in the prior year period and unrealized gains on the change in fair value of derivative instruments, net, of 16 million in the current period compared to losses of 19 million in the prior year period. 
 Taxes 
 We recognized 111 million of income tax provision for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Our effective tax rate was primarily driven by the full-year forecasted effective tax rate that takes into account income taxed at rates that differ from the 25 Canadian rate, including withholding taxes, offset with the availability of tax credits and changes in uncertain tax positions. We recognized 105 million of income tax provision in the prior comparable period.

 _________________________ 
 (1) The recognition of Adjusted EBITDA by a region on an intersegment shipment could occur in a period prior to the recognition of Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, depending on the timing of when the inventory is sold to the third-party customer. The "Eliminations and Other" column adjusts regional Adjusted EBITDA for intersegment shipments that occur in a period prior to recognition of Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The "Eliminations and Other" column also reflects adjustments for changes in regional volume, conversion premium and product mix, and conversion costs related to intersegment shipments for consolidation. "Eliminations and Other" must adjust for proportional consolidation of each line item for our Logan affiliate because we consolidate 100 of the Logan joint venture for U.S. GAAP, but we manage our Logan affiliate on a proportionately consolidated basis. 
 (2) Selling, general administrative and research development costs include costs incurred directly by each segment and all corporate related costs. 
 North America 
 Net sales increased 58 million, or 2 , driven primarily by higher average LME aluminum prices and a 3 increase in rolled product shipments. Higher beverage packaging shipments were partially offset by lower specialty and automotive shipments. Adjusted EBITDA was 368 million, a decrease of 2 , primarily driven by less favorable product mix, lower metal benefit from higher scrap pricing, and higher labor and other operating costs, partially offset by higher volume and product pricing. 
 44 

Europe 
 Net sales decreased 40 million, or 2 , driven by a 2 decrease in rolled product shipments. Lower automotive shipments due to production interruptions at the Sierre, Switzerland plant as a result of flooding were partially offset by higher beverage packaging shipments and higher average LME aluminum prices. Adjusted EBITDA was 153 million, a decrease of 19 , primarily driven by production interruptions at the Sierre, Switzerland plant, less favorable metal benefit from higher scrap pricing, higher operating cost, and lower specialties pricing. 
 Asia 
 Net sales increased 196 million, or 15 , driven primarily by a 12 increase in rolled product shipments due largely to higher beverage packaging shipments, higher average LME aluminum prices, as well as higher automotive shipments, partially offset by lower specialty shipments. Adjusted EBITDA was 183 million, an increase of 8 , primarily due to higher volume and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by less favorable metal benefits from higher scrap pricing, unfavorable product mix, as well as higher higher labor and energy costs. Additionally, we incurred higher freight costs compared to the prior year period, which in turn resulted in a higher freight cost pass-through in price to customers. 
 South America 
 Net sales increased 163 million, or 15 , driven by a 20 increase in rolled product shipments, primarily in the beverage packaging market and higher average LME aluminum prices. Adjusted EBITDA was 254 million, an increase of 44 , primarily due to higher volume, higher product pricing, favorable product mix, and favorable metal benefit. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We believe we maintain adequate liquidity levels through a combination of cash and availability under committed credit facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents and availability under committed credit facilities aggregated to 2.1 billion of liquidity as of September 30, 2024. Our primary liquidity sources are cash flows from operations, working capital management, cash, and liquidity under our debt agreements. Our recent business investments are being funded through cash flows generated by our operations and a combination of local financing and our senior secured credit facilities. We expect to be able to fund both our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, such as our continued expansions, servicing our debt obligations, and providing sufficient liquidity to operate our business, through one or more of the following: the generation of operating cash flows, working capital management, our existing debt facilities (including refinancing), and new debt issuances, as necessary. 
 Available Liquidity 
 Our available liquidity as of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, is as follows. 
 in millions September 30, 2024 March 31, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 1,071 1,309 Availability under committed credit facilities 988 1,008 Total available liquidity 2,059 2,317 
 The decrease in total available liquidity relates to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, primarily resulting from investing activities during the period. See Note 6 Debt for more details about our availability under committed credit facilities. 
 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash held in foreign countries in which we operate. As of September 30, 2024, we held 27 million of cash and cash equivalents in Canada, in which we are incorporated, with the rest held in other countries in which we operate. As of September 30, 2024, we held 406 million of cash in jurisdictions for which we have asserted that earnings are permanently reinvested, and we plan to continue to fund operations and local expansions with cash held in those jurisdictions. Cash held outside of Canada is free from significant restrictions that would prevent the cash from being accessed to meet the Company's liquidity needs, including, if necessary, to fund operations and service debt obligations in Canada. Upon the repatriation of any earnings to Canada, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to Canadian income taxes (subject to adjustment for foreign taxes paid and the utilization of the large cumulative net operating losses we have in Canada) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024, we do not believe adverse tax consequences exist that restrict our use of cash and cash equivalents in a material manner. 
 We use derivative contracts to manage risk as well as liquidity. Under our terms of credit with counterparties to our derivative contracts, we do not have any material margin call exposure. No material amounts have been posted by Novelis nor do we hold any material amounts of margin posted by our counterparties. We settle derivative contracts in advance of billing on the underlying physical inventory and collecting payment from our customers, which temporarily impacts our liquidity position. The lag between derivative settlement and customer collection typically ranges from 30 to 90 days. 
 45 

Obligations 
 Our material cash requirements include future contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include debt and related interest payments, finance and operating lease obligations, postretirement benefit plan obligations, and purchase obligations. See Note 6 Debt to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" within Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2024 Form 10-K for more details. 
 There are no additional material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Non-Guarantor Information 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's subsidiaries that are not guarantors represented the following approximate percentages of (a) net sales (including intercompany sales), (b) Adjusted EBITDA, and (c) total assets of the Company, on a consolidated basis (including intercompany balances). Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA. 
 Item Description Ratio Net sales represented by non-guarantor subsidiaries (for the six months ended September 30, 2024) 
 20 Adjusted EBITDA represented by non-guarantor subsidiaries (for the six months ended September 30, 2024) 
 20 Assets owned by non-guarantor subsidiaries (as of September 30, 2024) 
 15 
 In addition, for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company's subsidiaries that are not guarantors had net sales (including intercompany sales) of 2.0 billion and 1.8 billion, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024, those subsidiaries had assets of 3.1 billion and debt and other liabilities of 1.6 billion (including intercompany balances). 
 
 CAPITAL ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK 
 Novelis has in place a capital allocation framework that lays out the general guidelines for use of post-maintenance capital expenditure adjusted free cash flow for the next five years. We expect annual maintenance capital expenditures to be between 300 million to 350 million. We believe the long-term demand trends for flat-rolled aluminum products remain strong, and we have approximately 5 billion of debottlenecking, recycling, and new capacity capital investments under way, with a focus on increasing capacity and capabilities to meet growing customer demand. We intend to keep our net leverage ratio at or around approximately 3.5x during our strategic capital investment cycle underway, and guide approximately 8 -10 of post-maintenance capital expenditure adjusted free cash flow to be returned to our common shareholder. Payments to our common shareholder have been 100 million in each of the last three fiscal years, but such payments are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any such payments depend on, among other things, our financial resources, cash flows generated by our business, our cash requirements, restrictions under the instruments governing our indebtedness, being in compliance with the appropriate indentures and covenants under the instruments that govern our indebtedness, and other relevant factors. Past payments of return of capital should not be construed as a guarantee of future returns of capital in the same amounts or at all. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as reported in our 2024 Form 10-K. See Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for our principal areas of uses of estimates and assumptions. 
 
 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 See Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, if applicable, including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Total Adjusted EBITDA presents the sum of the results of our four operating segments on a consolidated basis. We believe that total Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure that measures operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. In reviewing our corporate operating results, we also believe it is important to review the aggregate consolidated performance of all of our segments on the same basis we review the performance of each of our regions and to draw comparisons between periods based on the same measure of consolidated performance. 
 Management believes investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Many investors are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations from one period to the next and would ordinarily add back items that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of our business. By providing total Adjusted EBITDA, together with reconciliations, we believe we are enhancing investors' understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing strategic initiatives. 
 48 

However, total Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our total Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Total Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, total Adjusted EBITDA: 
 does not reflect the Company's cash expenditures or requirements for capital expenditures or capital commitments; 
 does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company's working capital needs; and 
 does not reflect any costs related to the current or future replacement of assets being depreciated and amortized. 
 We also use total Adjusted EBITDA: 
 as a measure of operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis because it removes the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations; 
 for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budgets and financial projections; 
 to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; and 
 as a basis to calculate incentive compensation payments for our key employees. 
 Please see Note 16 Segment, Geographical Area, Major Customer and Major Supplier Information for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Under ASC 280, Adjusted EBITDA is our measure of segment profitability and financial performance of our operating segments, and when used in this context, the term Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA reported for the Company on a consolidated basis is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. Both terms have the same definition and there is no difference in the composition or calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented and Segment Income previously reported. 
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 Adjusted free cash flow consists of (a) net cash provided by (used in) operating activities continuing operations, (b) plus net cash provided by (used in) investing activities continuing operations, (c) plus net cash provided by (used in) operating activities discontinued operations, (d) plus net cash provided by (used in) investing activities discontinued operations, (e) plus cash used in the acquisition of assets under a finance lease, (f) plus cash used in the acquisition of business and other investments, net of cash acquired, (g) plus accrued merger consideration, (h) less proceeds from sales of assets and business, net of transaction fees, cash income taxes and hedging, and (i) less proceeds from sales of assets and business, net of transaction fees, cash income taxes and hedging discontinued operations. Management believes adjusted free cash flow is relevant to investors, as it provides a measure of the cash generated internally that is available for debt service and other value creation opportunities. In addition, this measure is a key consideration in determining the amounts to be paid as returns to our common shareholder. However, adjusted free cash flow does not necessarily represent cash available for discretionary activities as certain debt service obligations must be funded out of adjusted free cash flow. Our method of calculating Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be consistent with that of other companies.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND MARKET DATA 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry in which we operate, and beliefs and assumptions made by our management. Such statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies, and prospects under the heading "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," under the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "projects," "forecasts," and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, our belief that, the expected timing and results from investments in certain operating facilities, including our greenfield, fully-integrated rolling and recycling mill currently being built in Bay Minette, Alabama; our projections regarding financial performance, liquidity, capital expenditures, and investments; our expectations regarding trends in demand for aluminum flat-rolled products, including statements about our belief that long-term demand for aluminum automotive sheet will continue to grow; our expectations regarding volatility and uncertainty in general economic conditions; our expectations regarding the impact of lower availabilities and higher corresponding prices of scrap metal inputs on our business; the possible future impacts of geopolitical instability due in part to the Russia-Ukraine conflict; statements about our expectations regarding inventory supply levels in the beverage packaging market; statements about our expectation that automotive demand will grow as a result of increased adoption of aluminum in vehicle structures and components of both traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles; statements about our expectation that aerospace demand and shipments will continue to grow driven by increased air traffic and a need for fleet modernization; statements about our belief that significant aircraft industry order backlogs for key OEMS, including Airbus and Boeing, will translate into growth in the future and that our multi-year supply agreements have positioned us to benefit from future expected demand and statements about our expectation that long-term demand for building and construction and other specialty products will grow. These statements are based on beliefs and assumptions of Novelis' management, which in turn are based on currently available information. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve assumptions and risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied, or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. We do not intend, and we disclaim any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 Factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ from the results expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among other things: 
 disruptions or changes in the business or financial condition of our significant customers or the loss of their business or reduction in their requirements; 
 price and other forms of competition from other aluminum rolled products producers and potential new market entrants; 
 the competitiveness of our end-markets, and the willingness of our customer to accept substitutes for our products, including steel, plastics, composite materials and glass; 
 our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of strategic investments; 
 increases in the cost or volatility in the availability of primary aluminum, scrap aluminum, sheet ingot, or other raw materials used in the production of our products; 
 risks related to the energy-intensive nature of our operations, including increases to energy costs or disruptions to our energy supplies; 
 downturns in the automotive and ground transportation industries or changes in consumer demand; 
 public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 union disputes and other employee relations issues; 
 the impact of labor disputes and strikes on our customers; 
 loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract and retain such management and other personnel; 
 unplanned disruptions at our operating facilities, including as a result of adverse weather phenomena; 
 economic uncertainty, capital markets disruption and supply chain interruptions, including as a result of geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea, and the ongoing conflicts in the Gaza Strip and the surrounding region; 
 risks relating to certain joint ventures, subsidiaries and assets that we do not entirely control; 
 50 

cybersecurity attacks against, disruptions, failures or security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems; 
 risks related to rising inflation and prolonged periods of elevated interest rates; 
 risks related to timing differences between the prices we pay under purchase contracts and metal prices we charge our customers; 
 a deterioration of our financial condition, a downgrade of our ratings by a credit rating agency or other factors which could limit our ability to enter into, or increase our costs of, financing and hedging transactions; 
 adverse changes in currency exchange rates; 
 our inability to transact in derivative instruments, or our inability to adequately hedge our exposure to price fluctuations under derivative instruments, or a failure of counterparties to our derivative instruments to honor their agreement; 
 an adverse decline in the liability discount rate, lower-than-expected investment return on pension assets; 
 impairments to our goodwill, other intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; 
 tax expense, tax liabilities or tax compliance costs; 
 risks related to the operating and financial restrictions imposed on us by the covenants in our credit facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes; 
 our inability to protect our intellectual property, the confidentiality of our know-how, trade secrets, technology, and other proprietary information; 
 risks related to our global operations, including the impact of complex and stringent laws and government regulations; 
 risks related to global climate change, including legal, regulatory or market responses to such change; and 
 conflicts of interest and disputes arising between Hindalco and the Company that could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to the Company. 
 The above list of factors is not exhaustive. 
 This document also contains information concerning our markets and products generally, which is forward-looking in nature and is based on a variety of assumptions regarding the ways in which these markets and product categories will develop. These assumptions have been derived from information currently available to us and to the third-party industry analysts quoted herein. This information includes, but is not limited to, product shipments and share of production. Actual market results may differ from those predicted. We do not know what impact any of these differences may have on our business, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow. For a discussion of some of the specific factors that may cause Novelis' actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements, refer to the factors discussed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2024 Form 10-K, as the same may be updated from time to time in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or in other reports which we periodically file with the SEC. 
 51 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in metal prices (primarily aluminum, copper, zinc, and LMPs), energy prices (electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel), foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We partially manage our exposure to energy prices by entering into fixed forward purchase contracts with energy providers, predominantly in Europe. We generally apply the normal purchase and normal sale scope exception to these contracts and do not record the contracts at fair value. These energy supply contracts are not derivatives but function as a risk management tool for fluctuating energy prices. We manage our exposure to other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools only and not for speculative purposes. 
 Commodity Price Risks

Interest Rate Risks 
 We are subject to interest rate risk related to our floating rate debt. For every 100 basis point increase in the interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024, which includes term loan debt, net of interest rate swaps, our annual pre-tax income would be reduced by approximately 8 million. See Note 6 Debt to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to manage our debt cost. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio includes interest rate swap positions to fix the interest rate on various floating rate debt. See Note 10 Financial Instruments and Commodity Contracts to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. A decrease of 10 in the SOFR interest rate as of September 30, 2024, would have an estimated potential negative effect on the contracts' fair value of approximately 3 million. 
 53 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. 
 We have carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon such evaluation, management has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 54 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are a party to litigation incidental to our business from time to time. While the outcomes of these matters are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For additional information regarding litigation to which we are a party, see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2024 Form 10-K and Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors described in our 2024 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 
 Our business has been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by increases in the cost or volatility in the availability of primary aluminum, scrap aluminum, sheet ingot, or other raw materials used in the production of our products. 
 The supply risks relating to our metal inputs vary by input type. For example, we produce some of our sheet ingot requirements internally and source the remainder from multiple third parties in various jurisdictions, usually under contracts having a duration of at least one year. If our suppliers are unable to deliver sufficient quantities of aluminum and other raw materials to the necessary locations on a timely basis, including as a result of global supply chain issues, our production could be disrupted and our net sales, profitability, and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 As a result of macroeconomic headwinds we have faced over the past several years, such as prolonged inflationary cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of public health crises and geopolitical conflicts, we have been adversely affected, and may continue to be adversely affected in the future, by changes in the cost of these or other raw materials as well as labor costs, energy costs and freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials. Prices of certain raw materials may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials, the availability of complementary and substitute materials, inflationary pressures, and supply shortages and disruptions caused by a public health crisis or geopolitical factors relating to Russia's ongoing military conflict with Ukraine, attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea, and the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip and the surrounding region. The availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of our products may also be influenced by private or governmental entities, and may be impacted by mergers and acquisitions, changes in world politics or regulatory requirements (such as human rights regulations or environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or production curtailments), regulations, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, labor shortages, unstable governments in exporting nations, export quotas, sanctions, new or increased import duties, countervailing or anti-dumping duties, infrastructure and transportation issues, market forces of supply and demand, and inflation. We may be unable to offset fully the effects of material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. In addition, the failures of financial institutions and any related liquidity crises, and any resultant impact on depositor's access to their cash deposits, could negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis or at all, cause reductions in the liquidity of our suppliers impacting raw material product availability, and cause fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 
 Further, our operational performance is driven in part by our use of recycled aluminum in our aluminum products. The metal benefit from scrap aluminum is driven by consumer and manufacturer demand for scrap aluminum, and its related impact on the supply of scrap aluminum. Any pressure on scrap prices and availability which may result from changing scrap aluminum supply and demand may increase our production costs, which may ultimately adversely impact our results of operations. 
 We employ a number of strategies to manage raw material pricing volatility such as pass through contracts with customers and hedging of metal prices, but there is no assurance that these activities will be sufficient in fully mitigating raw material cost volatility. Our hedging strategies may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase. Delayed timing in recovering the pass-through of increasing raw material costs may also impact our short-term profitability and certain costs due to price increases or supply chain inefficiencies may be unrecoverable, which would also impact our profitability.
