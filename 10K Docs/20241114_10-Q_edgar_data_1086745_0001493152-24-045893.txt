, as a result of the non-cash changes in the warrant liability and the derivative liability,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and negative cash flow used in operations of for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling , restricted cash of 
and marketable securities of . In addition, overall working capital decreased by during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Management believes that the existing cash as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund operations for at
least the next twelve months following the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.) 

On
July 18, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that, based
upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the 30 consecutive business days between June 3, 2024, to July 17,
2024, the Company did not meet the minimum bid price of per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The letter also indicated that the Company will be provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar
days, or until January 14, 2025, in which to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). Delisting could harm the
Company s ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in
the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. 

On
August 7, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Series H-7 Purchase Agreement ), pursuant
to which it agreed to sell to certain existing investors (the Series H-7 Investors in a private placement (the Series
H-7 Private Placement (i) an aggregate of shares of the Company s newly designated Series H-7 convertible preferred
stock, par value per share, with a stated value of per share Series H-7 Preferred Shares ), and (ii) warrants
(the Series H-7 Investor Warrants initially exercisable for up to an aggregate of shares of common stock. The
Company raised gross proceeds of from the sale, which closed on August 10, 2023 (see Note 9). 

from the Private Placement proceeds into a newly established segregated deposit account of the Company Segregated Cash ),
and to use such Segregated Cash solely for the purpose of performing the Company s monetary obligations to the holders of the Series
H-7 Preferred Shares, provided, however, that the Company may use the Segregated Cash for any purpose, including general corporate purposes,
with the prior written consent of holders of at least 75 of the outstanding Series H-7 Preferred Shares. As of September 30, 2024, the
Company was in compliance with the restrictive provisions discussed above. 

The
Company may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials, including lithium-ion
battery cells, semiconductors, and integrated circuits. Any such increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact
the business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Certain production-ready components may be delayed in shipment to
Company facilities which has and may continue to cause delays in validation and testing for these components, which would in turn create
a delay in the availability of saleable vehicles. 

The
Company uses various raw materials, including aluminum, steel, carbon fiber, non-ferrous metals (such as copper), and cobalt. The prices
for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions, and global demand and could adversely affect business and operating
results. For instance, the Company is exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for lithium-ion cells. These risks include: 

the
 inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the number
 of lithium-ion cells required to support the growth of the electric vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases; 

disruption
 in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by the battery cell manufacturers; and 

an
 increase in the cost of raw materials, such as cobalt, used in lithium-ion cells. 

Any
disruption in the supply of lithium-ion battery cells, semiconductors, or integrated circuits could temporarily disrupt production of
the Company s vehicles until a different supplier is fully qualified. Moreover, battery cell manufacturers may refuse to supply
electric vehicle manufacturers if they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages
in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause the Company to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material
costs. Substantial increases in the prices for raw materials would increase operating costs and could reduce margins if the increased
costs cannot be recouped through increased electric vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recoup
the increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices. 

The
Company has made certain indemnities, under which the Company may be required to make payments to an indemnified party, in relation to
certain transactions. The Company indemnifies their directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the State
of Delaware. In connection with the Company s facility leases, the Company has indemnified their lessors for certain claims arising
from the use of the facilities. The duration of the indemnities vary and, in many cases, are indefinite. These indemnities do not provide
for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not
been obligated to make any payments for these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities.

Shipping
revenue 

Amounts
billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as shipping revenue. The Company has elected to recognize the cost
for freight and shipping when control over vehicles has been transferred to the customer as an operating expense. The Company has reported
shipping expenses of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, included in General and Administrative Expenses. 

Services
and other revenue 

Services
and other revenue consist of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when services
and replacement parts are provided. 

Miscellaneous
income 

Miscellaneous
income consists of late fees charged for receivables not paid within the terms of the customer agreement based upon the outstanding customer
receivable balance. This revenue is earned when a customer s receivable balance becomes delinquent, and its collection is reasonably
assured and is calculated using a stated late fee rate multiplied by the outstanding balance that is subject to a late fee charge.

Warranty
Reserve 

The
Company records a reserve for warranty repairs upon the initial delivery of vehicles to its dealer network. The Company provides a product
warranty on each vehicle including powertrain, battery pack and electronics package. Such warranty matches the product warranty provided
by its supply chain for warranty parts for all unaltered vehicles and is not considered a separate performance obligation. The supply
chain warranty does not cover warranty-based labor needed to replace a part under warranty. Warranty reserves include management s
best estimate of the projected cost of labor to repair/replace all items under warranty. The Company reserves a percentage of all dealer-based
sales to cover an industry-standard warranty fund to support dealer labor warranty repairs. The warranty reserve is recorded as a component
of cost of revenues in the statement of operations. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, warranty reserves were recorded
within accrued expenses of and , respectively.

Series
H-7 Preferred Stock 

On
August 7, 2023, the Company entered into the Series H-7 Purchase Agreement with the Series H-7 Investors, pursuant to which it agreed
to sell to the Series H 7 Investors (i) an aggregate of Series H-7 Preferred Shares with a stated value of per share, initially
convertible into up to shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price of per share, and (ii) Warrants
initially exercisable for up to an aggregate of shares of common stock in the Series H-7 Private Placement. 

The
Series H-7 Preferred Shares are convertible into common stock (the Conversion Shares at the election of the holder at
any time at an initial conversion price of 
(the Conversion Price ), which, following the Company s one-for-eight reverse stock split effected on September
15, 2023 Reverse Stock Split and pursuant to the stock combination event adjustment provisions in the Series H-7
Certificate of Designations, was subsequently reduced to .
The Conversion Price is subject to adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to
price-based adjustment in the event of any issuances of common stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for
common stock, at a price below the then-applicable Conversion Price (subject to certain exceptions). 

The holders of the Series H-7 Preferred Shares have the option to defer
amortization payments or, subject to certain limitations as specified in the Series H-7 Certificate of Designations, can elect to accelerate
installment conversion amounts. 

The
Series H-7 Certificate of Designations provides that, except as required by applicable law, the holders of the Series H-7 Preferred Shares
will be entitled to vote with holders of the Common Stock on an as converted basis, with the number of votes to which each holder of
Series H-7 Preferred Shares is entitled to be determined by dividing the Stated Value by a conversion price equal to per share
(as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split), which was the Minimum Price (as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d)) applicable
immediately before the execution and delivery of the Series H-7 Purchase Agreement, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations
and adjustments for any stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar transactions, as set forth
in the Certificate of Designations. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company s ability to settle conversions and make amortization and dividend make-whole payments using shares
of common stock is subject to certain limitations set forth in the Series H-7 Certificate of Designations. Further, the Series H-7 Certificate
of Designations contains a certain beneficial ownership limitation after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable
upon conversion of, or as part of any amortization payment or dividend make-whole payment under, the Series H-7 Certificate of Designations
or Series H-7 Warrants. 

The
Series H-7 Certificate of Designations includes certain triggering events including, among other things, the suspension from trading
or the failure of the common stock to be trading or listed (as applicable) on an eligible market for a period of five (5) consecutive
trading days, the Company s failure to pay any amounts due to the holders of the Series H-7 Preferred Shares when due. In connection
with a triggering event, each holder of Series H-7 Preferred Shares will be able to require the Company to redeem in cash any or all
of the holder s Series H-7 Preferred Shares at a premium set forth in the Series H-7 Certificate of Designations. 

The
Series H-7 Preferred Shares were determined to be more akin to a debt-like host than an equity-like host. The Company identified the
following embedded features that are not clearly and closely related to the debt host instrument: 1) make-whole interest upon a contingent
redemption event, 2) make-whole interest upon a conversion event, 3) an installment redemption upon an Equity Conditions Failure (as

Supply
Chain Agreements 

On
November 2, 2023, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Sirris Inc. Sirris ), a provider of motor vehicle parts
for innovative vehicle types. Sirris has agreed to supply rear and front shocks to support the manufacturing of the Company s electric
vehicle fleet. Sirris is committed to meeting the Company s upside demand for these products in the event production increases. 

On
December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Athena Manufacturing, LP, a provider of customizable sophisticated
metal products. As part of the agreement, the Company is able to submit requests for devices, component, component assembly, material
part, or piece that is custom to AYRO. This is a non-exclusive agreement in which the Company is able to engage other suppliers for these
products. 

Litigation 

The
Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business,
that it believes are incidental to the operation of its business. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations,
financial positions, or cash flows. 

On
March 23, 2018, DropCar was made aware of an audit being conducted by the New York State Department of Labor (the DOL regarding a claim filed by an employee. The DOL is investigating whether DropCar properly paid overtime, for which DropCar has raised
several defenses. In addition, the DOL is conducting its audit to determine whether the Company owes spread of hours pay (non-exempt
worker whose workday is longer than ten hours must receive an extra hour of pay at the basic minimum hourly rate). Management believes
the case has no merit. 

On
October 20, 2023, Club Car filed a complaint against the Company in the Superior Court of Columbia County, Georgia (Civil Action File
No.2023ECV0838) (the Club Car Complaint ), alleging that the Company had breached its contractual obligations to Club Car
under a master procurement agreement (the MPA entered into by and among AYRO Operating Company, Inc., the Company s
subsidiary AYRO Operating ), and Club Car on March 5, 2019 due to alleged defects in the vehicles sold to Club Car and
the Company s termination of warranty support following termination of the MPA. Club Car seeks unspecified damages and indemnification
for past and future customer claims with respect to the vehicles sold to Club Car under the MPA. The Company intends to vigorously contest
these allegations. 

In
February of 2024, Inventus Power, Inc. sued AYRO in the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit, County of DuPage, Illinois,
alleging that AYRO failed to pay invoices for certain battery packs and related equipment. In April of 2024, AYRO filed counterclaims
asserting that the battery packs in question were defective and not in compliance with contractual specifications. In August of 2024,
the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement, pursuant to which they agreed to dismiss with prejudice the claims and
counterclaims in this lawsuit. The settlement agreement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or
financial condition.

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking
terms such as anticipates, assumes, believes, can, could, estimates, 
 expects, forecasts, guides, intends, is confident that, may,

are not limited to, future financial and operating results, the company s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, statements
concerning the strategic review of our product development strategy, the development and launch of the AYRO Vanish (the Vanish and other statements that are not historical facts. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations
and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties,
and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations, or
projections described under the sections in this Form 10-Q and our other reports filed with the SEC titled Risk Factors 
and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

A
summary of the principal risk factors that make investing in our securities risky and might cause our actual results to differ materially
from those projected in these forward-looking statements is set forth below. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial
condition, results of operations, cash flows, cash available for distribution, and ability to service our debt obligations and prospects
could be materially and adversely affected. 

we
 may be acquired by a third party; 

we
 have a history of losses and have never been profitable, and we expect to incur additional losses in the future and may never be
 profitable; 

our
 failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq could result in a delisting
 of our common stock; 

holders
 of our Series H-7 Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of 1,000 per share Series H-7 Preferred Stock are entitled to certain payments that may be paid in cash or in shares of common stock depending on the circumstances, if we make
 these payments in cash, we may be required to expend a substantial portion of our cash resources, and if we make these payments in
 common stock, it may result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock; 

the
 certificate of designations for the Series H-7 Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designations and the warrants issued
 concurrently therewith contain anti-dilution provisions and other adjustment provisions that have resulted in the reduction of the
 conversion price of the Series H-7 Preferred Stock and the exercise price of such warrants and may do so again in the future. These
 features may increase the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series H-7 Preferred Stock or upon the
 exercise of the warrants; 

1 

under
 the Purchase Agreement (defined herein) we are subject to certain restrictive covenants that may make it difficult to procure additional
 financing; 

a
 significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from Club Car pursuant
 to the MPA (as defined herein). Following our termination of the MPA, our sales could decrease
 significantly, and we will need to identify new strategic channel partners to support the
 sales of our vehicles; 

we
 rely on a single third-party supplier and manufacturer located in Canada for certain sub-assembly and assembly parts for the Vanish
 and any disruption in the operations of this third-party supplier could adversely affect our business and results of operations; 

if
 we lose our exclusive license to manufacture the AYRO 411x model in North America, Cenntro could sell identical or similar products
 through other companies or directly to our customers; 

we
 may be unable to replace lost manufacturing capacity on a timely and cost-effective basis, which could adversely impact our operations
 and ability to meet delivery timelines; 

we
 may experience delays in the development and introduction of new products;

 market for our products is developing and may not develop as expected; 

we
 are currently evaluating our product development strategy, which may result in significant changes and have a material impact on
 our business, results of operations and financial condition;

 business is subject to general economic and market conditions, including trade wars and tariffs; 

if
 disruptions in our transportation network continue to occur or our shipping costs continue to increase, we may be unable to sell
 or timely deliver our products, and our gross margin could decrease; 

our
 limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of any investment
 in our securities; 

if
 we are unable to effectively implement or manage our growth strategy, our operating results and financial condition could be materially
 and adversely affected; 

developments
 in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may have a materially adverse effect on the demand

if
 we are unable to manage our growth and expand our operations successfully, our business and operating results will be harmed, and
 our reputation may be damaged; 

if
 we fail to include key feature sets relative to the target markets for our electric vehicles, our business will be harmed; 

unanticipated
 changes in industry standards could render our vehicles incompatible with such standards and adversely affect our business; 

our
 future success depends on our ability to identify additional market opportunities and develop and successfully introduce new and
 enhanced products that address such markets and meet the needs of customers in such markets; 

unforeseen
 or recurring operational problems at our facilities, or a catastrophic loss of our manufacturing facilities, may cause significant
 lost or delayed production and adversely affect our results of operations; 

2 

we
 may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully
 defend or insure against such claims; 

if
 our vehicles fail to perform as expected due to defects, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be seriously
 harmed; 

we
 depend on key personnel to operate our business, and the loss of one or more members of our management team, or our failure to attract,
 integrate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business; 

transitioning
 from an offshoring to an onshoring business model carries risk; 

we
 currently have limited electric vehicles marketing and sales experience, and if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities
 or enter into dealer agreements to market and sell our vehicles, we may be unable to generate any revenue; 

failure
 to maintain the strength and value of our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
 of operations; 

the
 range of our electric vehicles on a single-charge declines over time, which may negatively influence potential customers decisions
 whether to purchase our vehicles; 

an
 unexpected change in failure rates of our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and
 operating results; 

increases
 in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular lithium-ion battery cells, chipsets and displays, could
 harm our business; 

customer
 financing and insuring our vehicles may prove difficult because retail lenders are unfamiliar with our vehicles and our vehicles
 have a limited loss history determining residual values within the insurance industry;

 business may be adversely affected by labor and union activities; 

we
 rely on our dealers for the service of our vehicles and have limited experience servicing our vehicles, and if we are unable to address
 the service requirements of our future customers, our business will be materially and adversely affected; 

if
 we fail to deliver vehicles and accessories to market as scheduled, our business will be harmed; 

failure
 in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business; 

we
 may be required to raise additional capital to fund our operations, and such capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain,
 and could dilute our stockholders ownership interests; 

our
 long-term capital requirements are subject to numerous risks; 

we
 may invest in or acquire other businesses, and our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses
 into our company or otherwise manage the growth associated with multiple acquisitions;

 safety, emissions, fuel economy or other regulations may result in higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales restrictions; 

our
 vehicles are subject to multi-jurisdictional motor vehicle standards;

 may fail to comply with evolving environmental and safety laws and regulations; 

3 

changes
 in regulations could render our vehicles incompatible with federal, state, or local regulations, or use cases; 

unusual
 or significant litigation, governmental investigations or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in our vehicles, or otherwise,
 may derail our business; 

we
 are required to comply with state-specific regulations regarding the sale of vehicles by a manufacturer; 

we
 have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we are unable to remediate the material
 weakness, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, our business may be harmed; 

if
 we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary designs and intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed; 

we
 may need to obtain rights to intellectual property from third parties in the future, and if we fail to obtain licenses or fail to
 comply with our obligations in existing agreements under which we have licensed intellectual property and other rights from third
 parties, we could lose our ability to manufacture our vehicles; 

many
 of our proprietary designs are in digital form, and a breach of our computer systems could result in these designs being stolen; 

our
 proprietary designs are susceptible to reverse engineering by our competitors; 

if
 we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or know-how, such proprietary information may be used by others
 to compete against us; 

legal
 proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement and other challenges may require us to spend substantial
 time and money and could harm our business; 

we
 are generally obligated to indemnify our sales channel partners, customers, suppliers and contractors for certain expenses and liabilities
 resulting from intellectual property infringement claims regarding our products, which could force us to incur substantial costs; 

we
 are subject to exposure from changes in the exchange rates of local currencies; and 

we
 are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing
 requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws. 

For
a more detailed discussion of these and other factors that may affect our business and that could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements, see the risk factors and uncertainties set forth in Part II, Item
1A of this Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as amended on April
26, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect our
results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by us ultimately prove to be accurate. We undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise, except as required
by law. 

Overview 

We
design and manufacture compact, sustainable electric vehicles for closed campus mobility, low speed urban and community transport, local
on-demand and last mile delivery and government use. Our four-wheeled purpose-built electric vehicles are geared toward commercial customers,
including universities, business and medical campuses, last mile delivery services and food service providers. 

Nasdaq
Deficiency 

On
July 18, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that, based
upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the 30 consecutive business days between June 3, 2024, to July 17,
2024, the Company did not meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The letter also indicated that the Company will be provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar
days, or until January 14, 2025, in which to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). 

4 

There
is no assurance that we will maintain compliance with such minimum listing requirements. If Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading
on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of
or obtain our shares, and our ability raise future capital through the sale of our shares could be severely limited. Delisting could
also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest
and fewer business development opportunities. 

Products 

Our
vehicles provide the end user an environmentally friendly alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles (cars powered by gasoline
or diesel oil), for light duty uses, including low-speed logistics, maintenance services, cargo services, and personal/group transport
in a quiet, zero emissions vehicle with a lower total cost of ownership. 

Manufacturing
Agreement with Linamar 

On
July 28, 2022, we partnered with Linamar Corporation Linamar ), a Canadian manufacturer, in a manufacturing agreement (the
 Linamar MLA to provide certain sub assembly and assembly parts, including the cabin frame and skate for the Vanish (collectively,
the Products ). During the term of the Linamar MLA, Linamar has the exclusive right to supply the Products to the Company,
subject to certain exceptions. The Linamar MLA has an initial term of three years and will automatically renew for successive two-year
terms unless either party has given at least 12 months written notice of nonrenewal. On June 21, 2024, the Company notified Linamar
of its intention not to renew the Linamar MLA. As a result, the Linamar MLA will terminate in accordance with its terms on July 28, 2025. 

Supply
Agreement 

During
2020, we entered into a supply agreement with Gallery Carts Gallery ), a leading provider of food and beverage kiosks,
carts, and mobile storefront solutions. Joint development efforts have led to the launch of the parties first all-electric configurable
mobile hospitality vehicle for on-the-go venues across the United States. This innovative solution permits food, beverage,
and merchandising operators to bring goods directly to consumers. 

On
November 2, 2023, we entered into a supply agreement with Sirris Inc., Sirris a provider in motor vehicle parts for innovative
vehicle types. Sirris has agreed to supply rear and front shocks to support the manufacturing of our electric vehicle fleet. Sirris is
committed to meeting our upside demand for these products in the event production increases. 

On
December 21, 2023, we entered into a supply agreement with Athena Manufacturing, LP, a provider of customizable sophisticated metal products.
As part of the agreement, we are able to submit devices, component, component assembly, material part, or piece that is custom to AYRO.
This is a non-exclusive agreement in which we are able to engage other suppliers for these products. 

Factors
Affecting Results of Operations 

Internal
Restructuring 

On
January 31, 2024, the Company began implementing an internal restructuring to achieve greater efficiency in pursuit of its strategic
goals. As part of the Company s internal restructuring, among other things, the Company eliminated a substantial number of positions
at the Company, which may impact its financial position and results of operations, as the Company re-evaluates its sales, marketing,
and manufacturing functions. In connection with the restructuring, the Company began working closely with consultants to complete a thorough
review of its new 411 fleet vehicle model year 2023 refresh, the Vanish (the Vanish ), to achieve the Company s objective
of lowering the bill of materials BOM and overall manufacturing expenses, which in turn will reduce the Manufacturer s
Suggested Retail Price MSRP of the Vanish. 

As
part of this effort, in August 2024, Gilbert Villarreal was appointed as President of the Company s subsidiary, Ayro Operating
Company, Inc., and is expected to lead the review of the Vanish, including working with the Company s vendors and partners in connection with the Vanish.

Inventory
Obsolescence 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 86,840 and 1,709,449 impairment of inventory adjustment was recorded in cost of
goods sold, related to the Vanish product. Included in the impairment of inventory adjustment during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, 0 and 476,340, respectively, related to physical inventory stock adjustments. No such adjustments were recognized
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Revenue 

We
derive revenue from the sale of our four-wheeled electric vehicles, and, to a lesser extent, shipping, parts, and service fees. In the
past we have also derived rental revenue from vehicle revenue sharing agreements with tourist destination fleet operators, and, to a
lesser extent, shipping, parts, and service fees. Provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met, we typically recognize
revenue upon shipment, as title and risk of loss are transferred to customers and channel partners at that time. Products are typically
shipped to dealers, directly to end customers, or in some cases to our international distributors. These international distributors assist
with import regulations, currency conversions and local language. Our vehicle product sales revenues vary from period to period based
on, among other things, the customer orders received and our ability to produce and deliver the ordered products. Customers often specify
requested delivery dates that coincide with their need for our vehicles. 

Because
these customers may use our products in connection with a variety of projects of different sizes and durations, a customer s orders
for one reporting period generally do not indicate a trend for future orders by that customer. The Company continues to work on the engineering
of the Vanish, while the Company evaluates the commercialization of the product during the internal restructuring. 

Cost
of Goods Sold 

Cost
of goods sold primarily consists of costs of materials and personnel costs associated with manufacturing operations, and an accrual for
post-sale warranty claims. Personnel costs consist of wages and associated taxes and benefits. The cost of goods sold also includes freight
and changes to our warranty reserves. Allocated overhead costs consist of certain facilities and utility costs. We expect the cost of
revenue to increase in absolute dollars as product revenue increases. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 86,840 and 1,709,449 of impairment of inventory adjustment was recorded in cost
of goods sold, related to the Vanish product. Included in the impairment of inventory adjustment during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, 0 and 476,340, respectively, related to physical inventory stock adjustments. No such adjustments were recognized
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses consist of general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development expenses. Salaries and personnel-related
costs, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense are the most significant components of each category of operating expenses. Operating
expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities and utility costs. 

Research
and Development Expense 

Research
and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, prototype expenses, depreciation associated
with assets acquired for research and development, amortization of product development costs, product strategic advisory fees, third-party
engineering and contractor support costs and allocated overhead. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute
dollars as we continue to invest in new and existing products. 

Sales
and Marketing Expense 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel
and entertainment expenses and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, trade shows, events, corporate communications,
and brand-building activities. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales force, expand
our product lines, increase marketing resources, and further develop potential sales channels. 

6 

General
and Administrative Expense 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance,
legal, human resources, and fees for third-party professional services, and allocated overhead. We expect our general and administrative
expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing our business. 

Other
(Expense) Income 

Other
(expense) income consists of income received or expenses incurred for activities outside of our core business. Other (expense) income
consists primarily of interest expense, unrealized gain/loss on marketable securities, the changes in fair value of the warrant and the
derivative liability. 

Provision
for Income Taxes 

Provision
for income taxes consists of estimated income taxes due to the United States government and to the state tax authorities in jurisdictions
in which we conduct business. In the case of a tax deferred asset, we reserve the entire value for future periods.

Revenue 

Revenue
was 0.01 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.09 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease
of 94 or 0.08 million. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a reduction of 0.07 million in product sales and 0.01 million
decrease in shipping revenue. 

7 

Cost
of goods sold and gross loss 

Cost
of goods increased by 0.05 million, or 23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The
increase in cost of goods sold was mainly due to an increase of 0.09 million in inventory adjustments and allowances related to the
impairment of 411x vehicles, and overhead allocations to better reflect current inventory, offset by a decrease of 0.09 million in materials
due to decrease in sales. 

Research
and development expense 

Research
and development R D expense was 0.01 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.33
million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1.32 million, or 99 . The Company had a decrease of 0.56 million and 0.71 million
in R D design costs, and salaries and related personnel costs, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the Company being
substantially complete with the R D on the Vanish at the end of 2023, offset by the re-engineering work and design changes in the
current year associated with the internal restructuring. 

Sales
and marketing expense 

Sales
and marketing expense was 0.22 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.39 million for the same period
in 2023, a decrease of 0.17 million, or 45 . The Company had a decrease of 0.26 million in salaries and related expenses primarily
due to decreased headcount associated with the internal restructuring. 

General
and administrative expenses 

The
majority of our operating losses from continuing operations resulted from general and administrative expenses. General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our overall operations and with being a public company. These costs include personnel,
legal and financial professional services, insurance, investor relations, and compliance related fees. General and administrative expense
was 1.41 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.37 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of
 2.96 million, or 68 . Salaries and related expenses decreased by 1.0 million, office expenses decreased by 0.26 million, and consultants
services decreased by 0.18 million, primarily due to the decrease in headcount and expenses associated with the internal restructuring.
Cost and associated expenses related to the issuance of Series H-7 Preferred Stock decreased by 1.24 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 

Other
income and expense 

We
recorded a 8.83 million increase of net other income from a 0.05 million increase in interest income on cash accounts, an increase
in realized gains of 0.47 million on marketable securities, offset by a decrease of 0.64 million in the unrealized gain on marketable
securities, and an increase in other (income) expense of 0.47 million mainly due to settlements with vendors. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a gain of 2.41 million and 3.22 million, respectively, for
the change in fair value - derivative liability, a decrease of 0.81 million mainly due to the decrease in the Company s stock
price. The gain for the change in fair value derivative liability was due to the decrease in the fair value of the derivative
liability associated with the Series H-7 Preferred Shares that were issued in 2023. 

The
Company recognized a gain of 0.13 million and a loss of 10.10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
for the change in fair value - warrant liability, an increase of 10.23 million primarily due to the decrease in stock price and the
increase in the risk-free rate.

Revenue 

Revenue
was 0.06 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.34 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease
of 81 , or 0.28 million. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the reduction in product sales of 0.28 million. 

Cost
of goods sold and gross loss 

Cost
of goods increased by 1.76 million, or 225 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily
due to an increase of 1.71 million in inventory adjustments to more accurately reflect current inventory, and an increase in freight
charges of 0.30 million bringing inventory materials into the Company s warehouse from outside vendors, offset by a decrease in
materials of 0.25 million due to a decrease in sales. 

Research
and development expense 

Research
and development R D expense was 1.40 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.87
million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 4.47 million, or 76 . The Company had a decrease of 2.53 million and 1.15 million
in R D design costs, and salaries and related personnel costs, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the Company being
substantially complete with the R D on the Vanish at the end of 2023, offset by the re-engineering work and design changes in the
current year associated with the internal restructuring. 

Sales
and marketing expense 

Sales
and marketing expense was 0.77 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.53 million for the same period
in 2023, a decrease of 0.76 million, or 50 . Salaries and related expenses decreased by 0.58 million due to the reduction of our sales
and marketing resources. 

9 

General
and administrative expenses 

The
majority of our operating losses from continuing operations resulted from general and administrative expenses. General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our overall operations and with being a public company. These costs include personnel,
legal and financial professional services, insurance, investor relations, and compliance related fees. General and administrative expense
was 6.45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.46 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of
 4.01 million, or 38 . Salaries and related expenses decreased by 2.6 million, with office expenses decreased by 0.50 million, primarily
due to decreased headcount and expenses associated with the internal restructuring. Cost and associated expenses related to the issuance
of Series H-7 Preferred Stock decreased by 1.21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in
2023. 

Other
income and expense 

We
recorded a 20.69 million increase of net other income from a 0.01 million increase in interest income on cash accounts, an increase
in realized gains of 0.87 million on marketable securities, offset by a decrease of 0.58 million in the unrealized gain on marketable
securities, and an increase in other income (expense) of 0.67 million mainly due to settlements with vendors. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a gain of 5.04 million and 3.22 million, respectively, for
the change in fair value - derivative liability, an increase of 1.82 million mainly due to the decrease in the Company s stock
price. The gain for the change in fair value derivative liability was due to the decrease in the fair value of the derivative
liability associated with the Series H-7 Preferred Shares that were issued in 2023. 

The
Company recognized a gain of 9.14 million and a loss of 10.10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
for the change in fair value - warrant liability, an increase of 19.24 million primarily due to the decrease in stock price and the
increase in the risk-free rate. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 2.73 million in cash cand cash equivalents, 10.02 million in restricted cash, 16.13 million in marketable
securities and working capital of 28.28 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had 33.44 million in cash and cash equivalents and working
capital of 44.67 million, including 10 million in restricted cash. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and working capital was
primarily a result of our operating loss and the Company s internal restructuring. Our sources of cash since inception have been
predominately from the sale of equity and debt. 

Our
business is capital-intensive, and future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and
extent of spending to support development efforts, the results of our strategic review, the expansion of our sales and marketing teams,
the timing of new product introductions and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. We are working to control
expenses and deploy our capital in the most efficient manner. 

We
are evaluating other options for the strategic deployment of capital beyond our ongoing strategic initiatives, including potentially
entering other segments of the electric vehicle market. We anticipate being opportunistic with our capital, and we intend to explore
potential partnerships and acquisitions that could be synergistic with our competitive stance in the market. 

We
are subject to a number of risks similar to those of earlier stage commercial companies, including dependence on key individuals and
products, the difficulties inherent in the development of a commercial market, the potential need to obtain additional capital, and competition
from larger companies, other technology companies and other technologies. Based on the foregoing, management believes that the existing
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next
twelve months following the date of this report.

 Net
 cash provided (used) by financing activities 
 (5,104,889 
 21,632,156 

Operating
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 10.33 million in cash in operating activities, a decrease in use of 10.97 million
compared to the cash used in operating activities of 21.30 million during the same period in 2023. The decrease in cash used in operating
activities was primarily a result of the decrease in our operating loss as the Company proceeds with the internal restructuring. 

Our
ability to generate cash from operations in future periods will depend in large part on profitability, the rate and timing of collections
of our accounts receivable, inventory turnovers and our ability to manage other areas of working capital. 

Investing
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash of 15.25 million from investing activities as compared to 26.14 million of cash
used in investing activities during 2023, a decrease of 10.89 million. We used 15.08 million to invest in marketable securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 24.03 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 8.95 million and purchased 0.17 million in property
plant and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.08 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2023, a decrease of 1.91 million. 

Financing
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used cash of 5.10 million from financing activities as compared to 21.63 million of cash
provided in financing activities during 2023, a decrease of 26.73 million. The decrease in cash used was due to cash redemptions of
the Series H-7 preferred stock of 5.10 million, and no proceeds from private placement of preferred stock, as compared to 21.63 million
of proceeds from the private placement of preferred stock and no cash used in redemptions for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Known
Trends, Events, and Uncertainties 

Currently,
the Company is experiencing supply chain shortages, including with respect to lithium-ion battery cells, integrated circuits, vehicle
control chips, and displays. Certain production-ready components may be delayed in shipment to Company facilities, which has and may
continue to cause delays in validation and testing for these components, which would in turn create a delay in the availability of saleable
vehicles. Additionally, the emergence and effects of public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics and the consequences of the
ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and various factors in the Middle East, including related sanctions and countermeasures,
are difficult to predict, and could adversely impact geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, the global economy, and contribute to
increased market volatility, which may in turn adversely affect our business and operations. 

Other
than as discussed above and elsewhere in this report, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have
a material effect on our financial condition. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation
of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments
that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our assumptions,
estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time
our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. Accordingly, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

Our
critical accounting estimates have not changed materially from those previously reported in our Form 10-K.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not
applicable. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to the material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting discussed below. 

In
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management identified a material
weakness. In the Company s assessment the material weakness was related to the Company s lack of a sufficient number of accounting
personnel with the appropriate level of technical knowledge, experience and training in GAAP and SEC reporting requirements and in addition,
due to limited resources and headcount, we did not have multiple people in the accounting function for full segregation of duties. 

Plan
for Remediation of Material Weakness 

We
have engaged a third party to conduct a full assessment of our controls and procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as disclosed below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Resignation
of David E. Hollingsworth 

On
March 1, 2024, David E. Hollingsworth, who served as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, tendered his resignation from his roles
as an officer and employee of the Company, effective as of March 1, 2024. Mr. Hollingsworth s resignation from the Company was
not in connection with any disagreement between Mr. Hollingsworth and the Company, its management, the Board, or any committee of the
Board on any matter relating to the Company s operations, policies or practices, or any other matter. 

The
Appointment of Joseph Ramelli 

On
August 21, 2024, the Company appointed Joseph Ramelli to the position of Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may be involved in certain claims and litigation arising out of the ordinary course and conduct of business. Management
assesses such claims and, if it considers that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, provisions for loss are made based on management s assessment of the most likely outcome. 

The
information set forth in Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q is incorporated by reference herein. 

There
are no other material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers, affiliates, any registered or beneficial stockholder of more
than 5 of our Common Stock, or any associate of any of the foregoing is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

Except
as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors as identified in our Form 10-K. 

The
following description of risk factors includes any material changes to risk factors associated with our business, financial condition
and results of operations previously disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition
and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those
described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to
vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition, and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or
in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price. 

The
following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other
statements in this Form 10-Q. The following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-Q. 

Our
failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. 

Our
common stock is listed on Nasdaq. We must satisfy Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, a minimum
closing bid price of 1.00 per share or risk delisting, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A delisting of our
common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material
reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing
sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and
employees and fewer business development opportunities. 

On
July 18, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that, based
upon the closing bid price of the Company s common stock for the 30 consecutive business days between June 3, 2024, to July 17,
2024, the Company did not meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant
to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The letter also indicated that the Company will be provided with a compliance period of 180 calendar
days, or until January 14, 2025, in which to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). 

There
is no assurance that we will maintain compliance with such minimum listing requirements. If Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading
on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, an investor would likely find it significantly more difficult to dispose of
or obtain our shares, and our ability raise future capital through the sale of our shares could be severely limited. Delisting could
also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest
and fewer business development opportunities.
