 million in aggregate. 
 As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we estimated that no such contingent payments are expected to become due in connection with the acquisitions, and therefore accrued no liability. 
 The contingent consideration liability is measured each reporting period and recorded at fair value. The inputs used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are considered to be Level 3 inputs due to the lack of relevant observable market activity and significant management judgment. The approach to valuing the contingent consideration uses unobservable factors such as projected revenues and cost of goods sold over the term of the earnout period, discounted for the period over which the contingent consideration is measured, and volatility rates. Based upon these assumptions, the contingent consideration is then valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. An increase in future revenue and gross profit may result in a higher estimated fair value, while a decrease in future revenue and gross profit may result in a lower estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability. 
 Other Contingencies 
 We are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as various claims and legal actions involving contracts, employment claims, competitive practices, intellectual property infringement, product liability claims and other matters arising out of the conduct of our business. In the opinion of management, none of the actions, individually or in the aggregate, taking into account relevant insurance coverage, would likely have a material financial impact on the Company and we believe the range of reasonably possible losses from current matters, taking into account relevant insurance coverage, is immaterial. However, legal matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company s cash flows, financial position or results of operations in the period in which any such effects are recorded.

 Overview 
 We are one of the leading suppliers of replacement and upgrade parts in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, serving passenger cars, light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks, as well as specialty vehicles, including utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). We operate through three business segments: Light Duty, Heavy Duty, and Specialty Vehicle, consistent with the sectors of the motor vehicle aftermarket industry in which we operate. For more information on our segments, refer to Note 8, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Part II, ITEM 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As of December 31, 2023, we marketed approximately 133,000 distinct parts compared to approximately 129,000 as of December 31, 2022, many of which we designed and engineered. This number excludes private label stock keeping units and other variations in how we market, package and distribute our products, includes distinct parts of acquired companies and reflects distinct parts that have been discontinued at the end of their lifecycle. Our products are sold under our various brand names, under our customers private label brands or in bulk. We are one of the leading aftermarket suppliers of parts that were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment, or OE, manufacturers or salvage yards. These parts include, among other parts, leaf springs, intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, window regulators, radiator fan assemblies, tire pressure monitor sensors, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) coolers, UTV windshields, and complex electronics modules. 
 We generate most of our net sales from customers in North America, primarily in the United States. Our products are sold primarily through aftermarket retailers; through online platforms; dealers; national, regional and local warehouse distributors and specialty markets; and salvage yards. We also distribute aftermarket parts outside the United States, with sales primarily into Canada and Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. 
 We may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by our customers as well as our ability, and the ability of our suppliers, to deliver products ordered by our customers. The introduction of new products and product lines to customers, as well as business acquisitions, may also cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies as described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 New Product Development 
 New product development is an important success factor for us and has been a source of our growth. We have made incremental investments to increase our new product development efforts to grow our business and strengthen our relationships with our customers. The investments primarily have been in the form of increased product development resources, increased customer and end-user awareness programs, and customer service improvements. These investments historically have enabled us to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow revenues at levels that generally have exceeded market growth rates. 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 In the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we introduced 4,498 new distinct parts to our customers and end-users, including 1,374 New-to-the-Aftermarket parts. We introduced 6,106 new distinct parts to our customers and end-users in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including 1,791 New-to-the-Aftermarket parts. 
 One area of focus for the light-duty sector has been our complex electronics program, which capitalizes on the growing number of electronic components being utilized on today s OE platforms. New vehicles contain an average of approximately 100 electronic modules, with some high-end luxury vehicles exceeding that. Our complex electronics products are designed and developed in-house and tested to help ensure consistent performance, and our product portfolio is focused on further developing our leadership position in the category. 
 Another area of focus has been on products we market for the heavy-duty sector. We believe that this sector provides many of the same growth opportunities that the light-duty sector has provided us. We specialize in offering parts to this sector that were traditionally only available from OE manufacturers or salvage yards, similar to how we approach the light-duty sector. 
 Within the specialty vehicle sector, we focus on providing performance parts and accessories, and nondiscretionary repair parts for UTVs and ATVs. We develop products designed to be compatible across a wide variety of makes and models to enhance both the performance and appearance of customers vehicles. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 A key component of our strategy is growth through acquisitions, including the October 2022 acquisition of SuperATV and the August 2021 acquisition of Dayton Parts. SuperATV is a leading independent supplier to the powersports aftermarket with a family of highly respected brands spanning functional accessories and upgrades, as well as replacement parts for specialty vehicles. Dayton Parts is a manufacturer of chassis and other parts designed to serve the heavy-duty vehicle sector of the aftermarket. We may acquire businesses in the future to supplement our financial growth, increase our customer base, add to our distribution capabilities or enhance our product development resources, among other reasons. 
 
 Industry Factors 
 The Company s financial results are also impacted by various industry factors, including, but not limited to the number, age and condition of vehicles in operation at any one time, and the miles driven by those vehicles. 
 Vehicles in Operation 
 The Company s products are primarily purchased and installed on a subsegment of the passenger and light-duty vehicles in operation in the United States VIO ), specifically weighted towards vehicles aged 8-to-13 years old. Each year, the United States seasonally adjusted annual rate US SAAR of new vehicles purchased adds a new year to the VIO. According to data from the Auto Care Association Auto Care ), the US SAAR experienced a decline from 2008 to 2011 as consumers purchased fewer new vehicles as a result of the Great Recession of 2008. We believe that the declining US SAAR during that period resulted in a follow-on decline in our primary VIO subsegment (8-to 13-year-old vehicles) commencing in 2016. However, following 2011 and the impact of the Great Recession of 2008, U.S. consumers began to increase their purchases of new vehicles which over time caused the US SAAR to recover and return to more historical levels. The 8-to-13-year-old vehicle car parc has continued to grow over the past several years, which we expect will expand demand for aftermarket replacement parts as more vehicles remain in operation. 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, we believe that vehicle owners generally are operating their current vehicles longer than they did several years ago, performing necessary repairs and maintenance to keep those vehicles well maintained. We believe this trend has supported an increase in VIO, which increased to 295.9 million in 2023, a 1 increase over 2022. According to data published by Polk, a division of IHS Automotive, the average age of VIO increased to 12.6 years as of October 2023 from 12.4 years as of October 2022. 
 Miles Driven 
 The number of miles driven is another important statistic that impacts our business. Generally, as vehicles are driven more miles, the more likely it is that parts will fail and there will be increased demand for replacement parts, including our parts. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of miles driven through October 2023 increased 2.1 year over year in the light-duty sector. However, global gasoline prices remained high during fiscal 2023 and, if they continue, they may negatively impact miles driven as consumers reduce travel or seek alternative methods of transportation. 
 
 Brand Protection 
 We operate in a highly competitive market. As a result, we are continuously evaluating our approach to brand, pricing and terms to our different customers and channels. For example, we maintain brand protection policies, which are designed to ensure that certain of our branded products are not advertised below certain approved pricing levels. In addition, we may pursue legal remedies when we see third parties violating our intellectual property rights, including those that violate our patents, wrongfully represent our products as their own or use our product images for their own marketing efforts. 
 
 Discounts, Allowances and Incentives 
 We offer a variety of customer discounts, rebates, defective and slow-moving product returns and other incentives. We may offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discount terms of the invoice. In addition, we may offer pricing discounts based on volume purchased from us or other pricing discounts related to programs under a customer s agreement. These incentives can be in the form of off-invoice discounts that are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale. For those customers that choose to receive their incentives on a quarterly or annual basis instead of off-invoice, we provide rebates and accrue for such incentives as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly. Finally, rebates and discounts are provided to customers to support promotional activities such as advertising and sales force allowances. 
 Our customers, particularly our larger retail customers, regularly seek more favorable pricing and product return provisions, and extended payment terms when negotiating with us. We attempt to avoid or minimize these concessions as much as possible, but we have granted pricing concessions, indemnification rights and extended customer payment terms, and allowed a higher level of product returns in certain cases. These concessions impact net sales as well as our profit levels and may require additional capital to finance the business. We expect our customers to continue to exert pressure on our margins. 
 We may incur change-over costs to induce a customer to switch from a competitor s brand. These costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred. 
 
 Product Warranty and Overstock Returns 
 We warrant our products against certain defects in material and workmanship when used as designed on the vehicle on which it was originally installed. We offer a limited lifetime warranty on 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 most of our products in the light-duty parts categories, with more limited warranties for our heavy-duty and specialty vehicle products. In addition to warranty returns, we may permit our customers to return new, undamaged products to us within customer-specific limits if they have overstocked their inventories. At the time products are sold, we accrue a liability for product warranties and overstock returns as a percentage of sales based upon estimates established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of the claim and the probability of the customer return. Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period. Revisions to these estimates are made when necessary, based upon changes in these factors. We regularly study trends of such claims. 
 
 Foreign Currency 
 Many of our products and related raw materials and components are purchased from suppliers in a variety of non-U.S. countries. The products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, we generally do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product. 
 To the extent that the U.S. dollar changes in value relative to those foreign currencies in the future, the prices charged by our suppliers for goods under new purchase orders may change in equivalent U.S. dollars. The largest portion of our overseas purchases comes from China. The Chinese yuan to U.S. dollar exchange rate has fluctuated over the past several years. Any future changes in the value of the Chinese yuan relative to the U.S. dollar may result in a change in the cost of goods that we purchase from China. However, the cost of the goods we procure is also affected by other factors, including raw material availability, labor costs, tariffs and transportation costs. 
 We have operations located outside the United States with various functional currencies. Because our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, the assets, liabilities, net sales, and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar must be converted into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our financial results. 
 
 Impact of Labor Market and Inflationary Costs 
 We experienced broad-based inflationary impacts during the year ended December 31, 2023, notably in the first six months of the year, due primarily to global transportation and logistics constraints, which resulted in significantly higher transportation costs; tariffs; material costs; and wage inflation from an increasingly competitive labor market. Uncertain global supply chain and logistics stability driven by geopolitical events, higher labor costs and material inflation costs may negatively impact our results in the future. We attempt to offset inflationary pressures with cost-saving initiatives, price increases to customers and the use of alternative suppliers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing pricing increases in the future to recover increased inflationary costs. 
 
 Impact of Interest Rates 
 Our business is subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our customer accounts receivable sales programs, as a change in the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate Term SOFR or alternative discount rate affects the cost incurred to factor eligible accounts receivable. Additionally, our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates tied to Term SOFR or the applicable base rate. Under the terms of the credit facility, a change in interest rates affects the rate at which we can borrow funds thereunder and also impacts the interest cost on existing borrowings. Interest rates may hold steady at their current rates for prolonged periods or may increase 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 in the future, resulting in increased costs associated with our accounts receivable sales programs and outstanding borrowings. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we saw significant increases in Term SOFR and other reference rates. Interest rates remained elevated throughout the first nine months of 2024 but have shown recent signs of beginning to decline. 
 
 Impact of Tariffs 
 In the third quarter of 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) began imposing additional tariffs on products imported from China, including many of our products, ranging from 7.5 to 25 . The tariffs enacted to date increase the cost of many of the products that are manufactured for us in China. We have taken several actions to mitigate the impact of the tariffs including, but not limited to, price increases to our customers and cost concessions from our suppliers. We expect to continue mitigating the impact of tariffs primarily through, among other things, diversification of suppliers across geographies and selling price increases to offset the higher tariffs incurred. 
 In March 2022, the USTR reinstated tariff relief for certain categories of products imported from China that had expired. Absent further action by the USTR, the reinstated tariff relief will expire on May 31, 2025. The reinstated tariff relief applies to a limited number of our products and is not expected to materially impact our operating results.

 Percentage of sales information may not add due to rounding 
 
 Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales increased 15.6 million, or 3.2 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by increased customer demand and sales of new products launched in our Light Duty segment, partially offset by soft market conditions in the heavy duty and specialty vehicle sectors. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 300 basis points compared to the prior year period primarily due to the easing of inflationary pressures across the businesses and favorable mix from higher sales of new products, as well as operational efficiency initiatives delivering cost-savings. 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A increased 5.5 million, or 30 basis points as a percentage of net sales, for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period due to higher compensation and benefits costs. In the prior year period, SG A benefited from a 1.0 million fair value adjustment to the estimated contingent consideration related to a prior acquisition. 
 Our effective tax rate decreased to 22.3 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 from 23.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to favorable discrete items in the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Net sales increased 39.9 million, or 2.8 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by volume, including from new product introductions. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 540 basis points compared to the prior year period primarily due to sales of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A increased 24.8 million, or 110 basis points as a percentage of net sales, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to 13.4 million of favorable fair value adjustments in the prior year period to the estimated contingent consideration obligation for an acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs in the current year period. 
 Our effective tax rate increased to 23.6 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 from 22.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to favorable discrete items applied to a lower income before income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Segment Operating Results 
 Segment operating results were as follows: 
 For the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net Sales: Light Duty 393,577 374,697 1,138,228 1,076,619 Heavy Duty 59,615 62,841 178,613 199,495 Specialty Vehicle 50,581 50,648 158,584 159,378 Total 503,773 488,186 1,475,425 1,435,492 Segment profit: Light Duty 74,632 60,457 198,339 122,917 Heavy Duty 2,660 1,861 5,390 10,595 Specialty Vehicle 8,624 6,840 25,823 23,625 Total 85,916 69,158 229,552 157,137 
 Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Light Duty 
 Light Duty net sales increased 18.9 million, or 5.0 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer demand and sales of new products launched. 
 Light Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.0 for the three months ended September 28, 2024, from 16.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the easing of inflationary pressures, favorable mix driven by higher new product sales, and operational excellence initiatives delivering cost-savings, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs. 
 Heavy Duty 
 Heavy Duty net sales decreased 3.2 million, or 5.1 , for the three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net sales primarily reflects reduced customer demand from lower freight industry shipping volumes, partially offset by sales of new products in the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
 Heavy Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased 150 basis points for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by sales of lower-cost inventory, and the impact of investments we made as part of initiatives to grow sales and improve margins on a long-term basis. 
 Specialty Vehicle 
 Specialty Vehicle net sales remained flat for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 Specialty Vehicle segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.0 from 13.5 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by sales of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Light Duty 
 Light Duty net sales increased 61.6 million, or 5.7 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to volume increases, including sales of new products launched. 
 Light Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 17.4 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, from 11.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the sell-through of lower-cost inventory and operational excellence initiatives delivering cost-savings, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits costs. 
 Heavy Duty 
 Heavy Duty net sales decreased 20.9 million, or 10.5 , for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net sales primarily reflects reduced customer demand from lower freight industry shipping volumes in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, as well as sales performance in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by customers inventory restocking at the end of the global pandemic. 
 Heavy Duty segment profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 230 basis points for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by the deleveraging of fixed costs on lower net sales and the impact of investments we made as part of initiatives to grow sales and improve margins on a long-term basis. 
 Specialty Vehicle 
 Specialty Vehicle net sales remained relatively flat for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 Specialty Vehicle segment profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.3 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024, from 14.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the sell-through of lower-cost inventory and cost savings initiatives compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been our invested cash and the cash flow we generate from our operations, including accounts receivable sales programs facilitated through certain customers. Key components of our liquidity and capital resources were as follows: 
 (in thousands) September 28, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 45,127 36,814 Working Capital 754,753 686,558 Shareholders' equity 1,234,602 1,168,203 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our sources of available capital are adequate to meet our ongoing cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, our liquidity could be negatively affected by extending payment terms to customers, a decrease in demand for our products, higher interest rates, the outcome of contingencies or other factors. See Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies , in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies that may affect our liquidity.

 Payment Terms and Accounts Receivable Sales Programs 
 Over the past several years, we have continued to extend payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands. These extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash. Where available and when we deem appropriate, we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers that allow us to sell our accounts receivable to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment term extensions. However, any sales of accounts receivable through these programs ultimately result in us receiving a lesser amount of cash upfront than if we collected those accounts receivable ourselves in due course, resulting in accounts receivable factoring costs. Moreover, since these accounts receivable sales programs bear interest at rates tied to the Term SOFR or other reference rates, increases in these applicable rates increase our cost to sell our receivables and reduce the amount of cash we receive. See PART I, ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more information. Further extensions of customer payment terms would result in additional uses of cash or increased costs associated with the sales of accounts receivable. 
 Sales of accounts receivable under these programs, and related factoring costs were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Sales of accounts receivable 254,657 233,513 791,413 713,190 Factoring costs 11,939 12,255 38,171 37,674 
 If receivables had not been sold over the previous twelve months, approximately 557.7 million and 526.4 million of additional accounts receivable would have been outstanding at September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, based on our standard payment terms. We had capacity to sell more accounts receivable under these programs if the needs of the business warranted. 
 Credit Agreement 
 The Company has a credit agreement that provides a 600.0 million revolving credit facility and also includes a 500.0 million term loan with quarterly amortization payment requirements. The credit agreement matures on October 4, 2027. As of September 28, 2024, there was 61.8 million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and 475.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the term loan. Also on that date, we had outstanding letters of credit for 1.2 million in aggregate. Net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, we had 537.0 million available under the credit facility at September 28, 2024. 
 Our credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants. As of September 28, 2024, we were not in default with respect to our credit agreement. 
 Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in PART II, ITEM 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional information.

 Cash Flows 
 The following summarizes the activities included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 
 Nine Months Ended (in thousands) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 159,622 149,110 Cash used in investing activities (31,245) (32,869) Cash used in financing activities (120,033) (130,305) Effect of foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents (31) (17) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 8,313 (14,081) 
 For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, cash provided by operating activities increased 10.5 million over the prior year period, primarily driven by higher net income, partially offset by favorable working capital in the prior year period from significant inventory reductions. 
 Investing activities used cash of 31.2 million and 32.9 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to higher additions for property, plant and equipment in the prior year period. 
 Financing activities during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 included 78.1 million paid to repurchase 855,971 shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan, and the repayments of 31.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 9.4 million of our term loan balance under our credit agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repaid 119.7 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 9.4 million of our term loan balance under our credit agreement. The remaining uses of cash from financing activities in each period resulted primarily from the repurchase of our common stock from our 401(k) Plan and income tax withholding in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards RSAs and restricted stock units RSUs ). 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. Accounts receivable factored under our customer-sponsored accounts receivable sales programs bear interest at rates tied to Term SOFR or alternative discount rates and result in us incurring costs as those accounts receivable are factored. Additionally, interest expense from our variable rate debt is impacted by reference rates. 
 Under the terms of our customer-sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable, a change in the reference rate would affect the amount of financing costs we incur, and the amount of cash we receive upon the sales of accounts receivable under these programs. A one-percentage-point increase in Term SOFR or the discount rates on the accounts receivable sales programs would have increased our factoring costs and reduced the amount of cash we would have received by approximately 2.0 million for both the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and 6.3 million and 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Under the terms of our credit agreement, a change in the reference rate or the lender s base rate would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds thereunder. A one-percentage-point increase in the reference rate or base rate would have increased our interest expense on our variable rate debt under our credit agreement by approximately 1.4 million and 1.6 million for the three months ended

 September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and 4.2 million and 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e), were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act), that occurred during the three months ended September 28, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Control systems, no matter how well-conceived and operated, are designed to provide a reasonable, but not an absolute, level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations of its internal controls to enhance, where necessary, its procedures and controls.
