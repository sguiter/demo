On July 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , as amended, which replaced the incurred loss methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and securities held to maturity. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for securities available for sale. Allowance for Credit Losses - Securities Available for Sale The Company measures expected credit losses on securities available for sale based upon the gain or loss position of the security. For securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position which the Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost, the Company evaluates

 at September 30, 2024 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. If the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, an allowance for credit losses would be recorded, with a related charge to earnings, limited by the amount of the fair value of the security less its amortized cost. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value in earnings. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. There were securities available for sale not guaranteed by government agencies at September 30, 2024. Allowance for Credit Losses - Securities Held to Maturity The Company measures expected credit losses on securities held to maturity on a collective basis by security type and risk rating where available. The reserve for each pool is calculated based on a Probability of Default/Loss Given Default basis taking into consideration the expected life of each security. Held-to-maturity securities which are issued by the United States Treasury or are guaranteed by government agencies do not currently have an allowance for credit loss as the Company determined these securities are either backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and/or there is an unconditional commitment to make interest payments and to return the principal investment in full to investors when a debt security reaches maturity. In assessing the Company s investments in government-sponsored and U.S. government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and government-sponsored enterprise obligations, the contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by the respective government-sponsored enterprise FHLMC, FNMA, or GNMA. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the par value of the Company s investments. Certain items may cause the Company to change this methodology which include legislative changes that remove a government-sponsored enterprise s ability to draw funds from the U.S. government, or legislative changes to housing policy that reduce or eliminate the U.S. government s implicit guarantee on such securities. The Company will evaluate its position no less than annually. Any expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities would be presented as an allowance for credit loss. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities totaled at September 30, 2024 and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

Residential loans are subject to a blanket lien securing Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances. See Note 7 of these unaudited consolidated financial statements. Effect of New Financial Accounting Standards On July 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , as amended, which requires that the recognition of the allowance for credit losses be estimated using the CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and securities held to maturity. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for securities available for sale. One such change is to require credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on securities available for sale that are determined to have impairment related to credit losses. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning July 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326.

 at September 30, 2024 and at June 30, 2024, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The loan loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of loan portfolio segments, which are disaggregated by call code. For each of these pools, the Company collects historical loss data, dating back to March 2008, from a selection of peer banks and applies the annual historical loss rate over the estimated remaining average life of the loan portfolio segment. The use of peer banks' historical loss rates is due to the lack of loss history experienced by the Bank. The average remaining life of a loan portfolio segment is adjusted for estimated prepayment and curtailment expectations. The modeling for estimated prepayment speeds and curtailment rates is based on a combination of historical internal estimates and market estimates. The quantitative component of the ACL on loans is model-based and utilizes a forward-looking macroeconomic forecast. The Company uses a Weighted Average Remaining Maturity WARM method, incorporating historical loss data based on statistically derived economic variable loss drivers, to estimate expected credit losses. This process includes estimates which involve modeling loss projections attributable to existing loan balances, and considers historical experience, current conditions, and future expectations for segments of loans over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The historical information is collected from a selection of peer banks and is derived from a combination of recessionary and non-recessionary performance periods for which data is available. Residential one- to four-family: This segment consists of one- to four-family, owner-occupied, residential mortgage loans, virtually all of which are secured by properties in our market area. Generally, mortgages with loan-to-value ratios greater than require private mortgage insurance, with limited exceptions. Underwriting approval is dependent on review of the borrower's ability to repay and credit history in accordance with the Company's policy. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing pricing, will have an effect on the credit quality of this segment. Multi-family : This segment consists of real estate loans secured by properties of five or more rental units within our market area. We consider a number of factors in originating multi-family loans. We evaluate the qualifications, income level and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties can be adversely impacted by a downturn in the economy due to increased vacancy rates or diminished cash flows, which in turn would have an effect on the credit quality of this segment. Management obtains financial information annually and monitors the cash flows of these loans. Second mortgages and home equity lines of credit : Second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are multi-purpose loans used to finance various home or personal needs for which a one- to four-family primary or secondary residence serves as collateral. We generally originate home equity lines of credit with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of (including the value of the underlying mortgage loan) and with terms of up to years. We originate second mortgage loans on owner-occupied properties with fixed rates of interest. We generally originate these loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of (including the value of the underlying mortgage loan) and with terms of up to years. Underwriting approval is dependent on review of the borrower's ability to repay and credit history in accordance with the Company's policy. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing pricing, will have an effect on the credit quality of this segment.

The reversal for credit losses for loans was primarily due to changes in economic factors, lower loan balances and continued strong asset quality for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The reversal for credit losses for off-balance sheet exposures was primarily due to a decrease of in unfunded commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The Bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis and the commitments are collateralized by real estate. Operating lease commitments The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), on July 1, 2022, and began recognizing operating leases on its consolidated balance sheet by recording a Right-Of-Use ("ROU") asset, representing the Company's legal right to use the leased assets and a net lease liability, representing the Company's legal obligation to make these lease payments.

The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the Company's stock on the date of the grant and the maximum term of each option is . The total number of shares reserved for restricted stock is . Options and awards generally vest ratably over three to five years . The fair value of shares awarded is based on the market price at the date of grant and amortized as compensation expense with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital over the required service period. Reductions in compensation expense associated with forfeited options are estimated at the date of grant, and this estimated forfeiture rate is adjusted based on actual forfeiture experience. Stock Options The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Volatility is based on peer group volatility because the Company does not have a sufficient trading history. 

 Expected life represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, taking into account the contractual term, and the vesting period. 

 Expected dividend yield is based on the Company's history and expectations of dividend payouts. 

 The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.

Ite m 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 This discussion and analysis is based on our unaudited consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements, which appear beginning on page F-1 of Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Overview 
 Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income and, to a lesser extent, non-interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings. Non-interest income consists primarily of earnings on bank-owned life insurance, service charges on deposit accounts and other income. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for credit losses and non-interest expense. Non-interest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing costs, advertising, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance premiums and other expenses. Our results of operations also are affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. 
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, assume, plan, seek, expect, will, may, should, indicate, would, believe, contemplate, continue, target and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 
 statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and 

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report. 
 The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: 
 general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected, including potential recessionary conditions; 

changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs and changes in estimates of or methodology for the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; 

our ability to access cost-effective funding; 

changes in liquidity, including the size and composition of our deposit portfolio and the percentage of uninsured deposits in the portfolio; 

fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions; 

demand for loans and deposits in our market area; 

our ability to implement our business strategy; 

competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses, and prepayments on loans we have made and make; 

adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets; 

40 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums or changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of the U.S. Treasury or Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; 

changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; 

technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; 

the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected; 

a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyber attacks; 

our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical event; 

our ability to retain key employees; 

our compensation expense associated with equity allocated or awarded to our employees; and 

changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 

Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the Company assumes no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policy discussed below to be a critical accounting policy. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in changes that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 
 The Jumpstarts Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an emerging growth company, we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our unaudited consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 
 On July 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires that the recognition of the allowance for credit losses be estimated using the CECL methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require that impairment related to credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available-for-sale debt securities. For further discussion related to the implementation of CECL please refer to Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 There have been no additional material changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information on our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 1 of the audited consolidated financial statements within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 Total Assets. Total assets increased 1.1 million, or 0.3 , to 364.5 million at September 30, 2024, from 363.4 million at June 30, 2024. The increase resulted primarily from increases in cash and cash equivalents of 3.7 million, or 13.8 , offset by a decrease in loans of 2.4 million, or 1.4 . 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased 3.7 million, or 13.8 , to 30.7 million at September 30, 2024, from 27.0 million at June 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in deposits of 829,000, or 0.3 , a decrease in net loans of 2.4 million, or 1.4 , and a decrease in securities held to maturity of 141,000, or 0.1 . 
 Net Loans. Net loans decreased 2.4 million, or 1.4 , to 168.0 million at September 30, 2024, from 170.4 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in one- to four-family residential real estate loans of 2.2 million, or 1.6 , a decrease in second mortgages and home equity lines of credit of 140,000, or 4.2 , and a decrease in multi-family loans of 105,000, or 0.9 , offset by a decrease in the allowance for credit losses of 48,000, or 3.1 . The decrease in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, second mortgages and home equity lines of credit and multi-family loans was the result of borrower principal payments exceeding new originations, which decreased due to the higher interest rate environment. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the decrease in loan balances and improved economic forecasted conditions. 
 Securities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale decreased 5,000, or 4.4 , to 108,000 at September 30, 2024, from 113,000 at June 30, 2024, due to prepayments and the change in unrealized losses. 
 Securities Held to Maturity. Securities held to maturity decreased 141,000, or 0.1 , to 146.9 million at September 30, 2024, from 147.0 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to maturities and principal repayments offset by purchases and the decrease in the provision for credit losses of 15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Total Liabilities. Total liabilities increased 1.1 million, or 0.4 , to 288.5 million at September 30, 2024, from 287.4 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was the result of an increase in deposits of 829,000, or 0.3 , an increase in mortgagors' escrow accounts of 65,000, or 4.3 , and an increase in accrued expenses of 190,000, or 5.0 , offset by a decrease in the operating lease liability of 22,000, or 2.5 . 
 Deposits. Deposits increased 829,000, or 0.3 , to 271.7 million at September 30, 2024, from 270.8 million at June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 1.9 million, or 1.5 , in certificates of deposit, an increase in savings accounts of 467,000, or 0.9 , and an increase in money market accounts of 431,000, or 2.0 , offset by a decrease in NOW and demand accounts of 2.0 million, or 3.2 . The change in composition and the increase in certificates of deposit was a result of the Bank offering certificate of deposit promotions as customers seek accounts with higher interest rates. 
 Borrowings. Borrowings, consisting entirely of FHLB advances, were 10.4 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. 
 Stockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity decreased 15,000 to 76.0 million at September 30, 2024, from 76.0 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a net loss of 6,000 and the repurchase of 17,311 shares at a cost of 117,000, offset by the change in unearned ESOP compensation of 26,000 and stock-based compensation of 90,000. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 General. We recorded a net loss of 6,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of 123,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 129,000, or 104.9 . Net interest income decreased 163,000, or 9.0 , non-interest income increased 10,000, or 6.3 , non-interest expense decreased by 45,000, or 2.3 , tax expense decreased 74,000 or 79.6 , and the recovery in the provision for credit losses decreased 94,000, or 56.6 . 
 Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 487,000, or 17.8 , to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was attributable to an increase of 62,000, or 3.6 , in interest on loans, an increase of 140,000, or 14.5 , in interest on securities and an increase of 285,000, or 633.3 , in interest on short-term investments. Interest income on loans increased due to an increase in the average yield of 26 basis points to 4.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.90 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by the decrease in the average balance of 5.2 million, to 171.5 million at September 30, 2024, from 176.7 million at September 30, 2023. Interest income on securities increased due to an increase in the average yield on securities of 39 basis points to 3.05 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.66 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by the decrease in the average balance of 1.7 million to 147.6 million at September 30, 2024, from 149.3 million at September 30, 2023. Interest income on short-term investments increased due to an increase in the average balance of 23.0 million to 26.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a 24 basis point increase in the 
 42 

average yield to 4.91 at September 30, 2024, from 4.67 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets resulted from the higher interest rate environment. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 650,000, or 70.2 , to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 926,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the average rate on certificates of deposit of 128 basis points to 4.28 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.00 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit of 21.3 million to 133.1 million, from 111.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the higher interest rate environment and promotions offered by the Bank. Interest expense on FHLB advances increased 69,000 due to a 6.8 million increase in the average balance of borrowings to 10.4 million with an average rate of 4.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an average balance of borrowings of 3.6 million, with an average rate of 5.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by decreases in the average balance of savings deposits of 8.4 million, or 13.5 , to 54.0 million and a decrease in the average balance of money market deposits of 3.9 million, or 14.9 , to 22.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 26.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in composition and the increase in certificates of deposits was a result of the Bank offering certificate promotions as customers seek accounts with higher interest rates. 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 163,000, or 9.0 , to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to an increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 95 basis points, offset by a 42 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The net interest rate spread decreased 56 basis points to 1.21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.77 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin decreased 30 basis points to 1.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.22 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest rate spread was a result of the increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities exceeding the increase in the average yield earned on interest-bearing assets. 
 Provision for Credit Losses. A reversal of credit losses of 71,000 was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The 8,000 reversal of credit losses for off-balance sheet exposures was primarily due to a decrease of 842,000 in unfunded commitments for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The 48,000 reversal of credit losses for loans was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting continued strong asset quality, improvements in forecasted economic conditions and lower loan balances. The allowance for credit losses for loans was 1.5 million, or 0.89 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 million, or 0.94 of total loans, at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was 1.6 million, or 0.90 of total loans, at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.4 million in residential one- to four-family loans rated substandard and individually evaluated due to the borrowers' inability to show sufficient rent receipts to support the debt coverage with a provision for credit loss of 10,000. There were no loans rated special mention, doubtful or loss and no non-performing loans at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2023, we had four loans totaling 1.4 million rated special mention. We had no loans rated substandard, doubtful or loss and no non-performing loans at September 30, 2023. We had 1,000 in charge-offs related to overdrawn deposit accounts and no recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2024. We had no charge-offs and no recoveries for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Provision for Income Taxes. The Company recorded a provision for income tax of 19,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for income taxes of 93,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 74,000 in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the decrease in income before income taxes. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was greater than pre-tax income of 13,000 due to a 46,000 increase in the valuation allowance on the charitable contribution carryover.

Management of Market Risk 
 General . The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans and investment securities, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage the impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and capital. We have an Asset/Liability Committee that is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity, and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. The Asset/Liability Committee establishes and monitors the amount, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. 
 As part of our ongoing asset-liability management, we use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk: 
 market our deposit products; 

diversify our loan mix; 

invest in short- to medium-term repricing and/or maturing securities whenever the market allows; 

engage in Asset/Liability leverage strategies when appropriate; in which we use additional borrowings to add assets to increase profitability and liquidity; and 

maintain a strong capital position. 

We do not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options, or interest rate swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage-backed securities. 
 We consider two types of simulations impacted by changes in interest rates, which are (1) net interest income and (2) changes in the economic value of equity. 
 Net Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation model, the results of which are provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning September 30, 2024 resulting from potential changes in interest rates, expressed in basis points. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income. 
 Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.

Economic Value of Equity . We monitor interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model that estimates the amounts by which the fair value of our assets and liabilities (our economic value of equity or EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The quarterly reports developed in the simulation model assist us in identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling interest rate risk to ensure compliance within our policy guidelines. 
 The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2024, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

(1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. 

(2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts of Colonial Federal Savings Bank, which had a book value of 63.9 million at September 30, 2024. 

(3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. 

(4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. 

The table above indicates that at September 30, 2024, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would experience a 18.2 decrease in EVE, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a 13.0 increase in EVE. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE table presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and will differ from actual results. 
 EVE calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits, and borrowings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity . Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and proceeds from maturities and calls of securities and borrowings from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. At September 30, 2024, we had 10.4 million of outstanding advances from the FHLB. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow an additional 49.6 million in FHLB advances. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, we had 2.4 million and 27.2 million under available lines of credit with the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, respectively, none of which was drawn at September 30, 2024. 
 While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. 
 Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 366,000 and 436,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of investment securities, offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on securities, was 2.6 million and 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was 777,000, compared to 3.1 million used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in net cash related to financing activities were primarily related to changes in deposit and short-term borrowing balances, offset by treasury stock purchased for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments based on our current strategy to increase loans with an increase in core deposits as supplemented by the use of FHLB advances as needed. 
 Capital Resources. At September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements. See Note 8 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements of this quarterly report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. The financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit, which involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 656,000 of commitments to originate loans, 3.9 million of unadvanced funds under home equity lines of credit and 1.4 million of unadvanced funds under commercial and other lines of credit. See Note 9 in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. 
 49 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 in the Notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements and note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or re-issued accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are applicable to non-public companies. 
 Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 The unaudited financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.

 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

 As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations are operating in an effective manner. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
