 Overview 
 
 We are a Maryland statutory trust formed on February 6, 2023. Our investment strategy is focused primarily on originating, acquiring, financing and managing a portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate assets that are primarily long-term leased under net lease structures to tenants for whom the properties are mission critical, meaning essential to the continuance of their business operations. We will also prioritize investing in real estate sectors such as industrial (e-commerce), manufacturing (on-shoring and near-shoring) and healthcare (aging demographics). To a lesser extent, we may invest in commercial real estate debt-related assets, which may include first mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, real estate-related corporate credit, and commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ), as well as other real estate-related securities (such as common and preferred stock of publicly traded REITs and other real estate companies) and loans (collectively referred to as, CRE debt investments ). 
 
 We are an externally advised, perpetual-life REIT formed to pursue the following investment objectives: 
 
 Preserve and protect invested capital; 
 
 Provide attractive current income in the form of predictable, stable cash distributions; 
 
 Realize appreciation in NAV from differentiated sourcing, investment selection, structuring and proactive asset management; and 
 
 Provide an investment alternative for shareholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate and private credit funds with the potential for additional upside through real estate tax advantages and appreciation potential, and with potentially lower volatility than publicly-traded real estate companies. 
 
 We may not achieve our investment objectives. See Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Registration Statement. 
 
 We are structured as a non-listed, perpetual-life real estate investment trust ("REIT"), and therefore our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange and, as of the date of this Form 10-Q, there is no plan to list our securities on a national securities exchange. We are organized as a holding company and plan to conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries. Commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2024, we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") for U.S. federal income tax purposes and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
 
 Our board of trustees will at all times have ultimate oversight and policy-making authority over us, including responsibility for governance, financial controls, compliance and disclosure. Pursuant to an advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement ), by and among us, NH Net REIT Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership ), and MSREF Real Estate Advisor, Inc. (the Adviser ), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) Morgan Stanley ), however, we have delegated to the Adviser the authority to source, evaluate and monitor our investment opportunities and make decisions related to the acquisition, management, financing and disposition of our assets, in accordance with our investment objectives, guidelines, policies and limitations, subject to oversight by our board of trustees. 
 
 On January 11, 2024, we commenced a continuous, blind pool private offering (the Offering of an unlimited number of our common shares in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) and Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder, to investors that are (i) accredited investors (as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act) and (ii) in the case of common shares sold outside the United States, to persons that are not U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act). We intend to sell our common shares in the Offering on a monthly basis. We completed the initial closing of the Offering and our principal operations commenced on April 1, 2024. 
 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, we have received gross proceeds of 626,168 from the sale of our common shares and contributed the net proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a corresponding number of Operating Partnership units. The Operating Partnership has primarily used the net proceeds to make investments. We intend to continue selling shares on a monthly basis. 
 
 We are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting real estate generally, that may be reasonably anticipated to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or income to be derived from acquiring properties or real estate-related securities, other than those referred to in this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Q3 2024 Highlights 
 
 Capital Activity 
 
 Raised gross proceeds of 187,936 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, through the sale of our common shares. 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 Declared monthly net distributions totaling 7,353 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The details of our total returns are shown in the following table: 
 
 Class S Class F-S Class I Class F-I Class E Annualized Distribution Rate (1) 
 N/A 4.40 N/A 5.25 5.25 Inception-to-Date Total Return (2)(3) 
 1.02 2.74 1.16 3.18 3.21 
 
 (1) The annualized distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the declared distributions per share as of September 30, 2024 and dividing by the NAV per share as of August 31, 2024. The inaugural monthly distribution for Class S and Class I were declared in August 2024 and the annualized distribution rates for each of those classes will be disclosed once distributions have been declared for two consecutive fiscal quarters. Refer to Note 10 - Equity for more information. 
 (2) Total return is calculated as the change in NAV per share from the date the first share of each respective class was sold through September 30, 2024, plus any distributions per share declared in the period and assumes reinvestment of distributions pursuant to the Company's distribution reinvestment plan. The inception dates for the Class F-S, F-I and E shares are April 1, 2024 and inception dates for Class S and I shares are August 1, 2024. We believe total return is a useful measure of our overall performance. 
 (3) Class S and Class F-S shares exclude upfront selling commissions. Inclusive of the maximum upfront selling commissions, the inception-to-date total return for class Class S and Class F-S are -1.92 and -0.25 , respectively. 
 
 Investments 
 
 Acquired three additional industrial properties and one retail property for an aggregate gross purchase price of 142,343. The acquisitions are consistent with our strategy of acquiring income-producing, mission-critical, single-tenant, net leased commercial properties.

 Rental Property Operating 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , operating expenses in connection with our real estate investments increased by 417 .

 Management Fee 
 
 Certain affiliates of the Company, including the Adviser, will receive fees and compensation in connection with the Offering and ongoing management of the assets of the Company. The Adviser will be paid a management fee equal to (1) 0.50 of NAV for Founder Share Classes and (2) 1.25 of NAV for shares classes other than the Founder Share Classes except Class E shares, in each case, per annum payable monthly. Additionally, to the extent that the Operating Partnership issues Operating Partnership units to parties other than the Company, the Operating Partnership will pay the Adviser a management fee equal to (1) 0.50 of the NAV of the Operating Partnership attributable to Founder Share Class units not held by the Company and (2) 1.25 of NAV of the Operating Partnership attributable to units other than Founder Share Class units not held by the Company except Class E Operating Partnership units, in each case, per annum payable monthly. The management fee will be paid, at the Adviser s election, in cash, Class E shares or Class E Operating Partnership units, or any combination thereof. 
 
 The Adviser has agreed to waive the management fee through April 1, 2025, which is the date that is 12-months following the initial closing of the Offering and as such the Company has not yet incurred a management fee. 
 
 Performance Participation Allocation

These costs are inclusive of amounts incurred prior to the Company's commencement of principal operations on April 1, 2024.

 Under GAAP, shareholder servicing fees are accrued upon the sale of Class S or Class F-S shares, while for NAV only the portion that is payable in the proceeding month is recognized. 
 
 The Adviser agreed to advance certain organization and offering costs and operating expenses on our behalf through April 1, 2025. Such costs will be reimbursed to the Adviser on a pro-rata basis over a 60 month period beginning April 1, 2025. Amounts advanced by the Adviser will not impact NAV until such amounts are reimbursed by the Company. 
 
 We depreciate our investments in real estate and amortize certain other assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP. Such depreciation and amortization is not recorded for purposes of calculating our NAV. For the purposes of calculating our NAV investments in real estate and borrowings are held at their fair values. 
 
 We recognize rental revenue on a straight-line basis under GAAP. Such straight-line rent adjustments are excluded for purposed of calculating NAV. 

Distributions 
 
 We commenced our principal operations on April 1, 2024 and declared distributions for common shareholders of record as of the last business day of each month thereafter. Each class of our common shares received the same aggregate gross distribution per share, however the net distribution varies for each class based on the applicable shareholder servicing fee, which is deducted from the monthly distribution per share and paid directly to Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc., the dealer manager for the Offering (the "Dealer Manager").

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP involve significant judgments and assumptions and require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments will affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our significant accounting policies that we believe are the most affected by our judgments, estimates, and assumptions. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this for further descriptions of the below accounting policies. 
 
 Investments in Real Estate 
 
 We expect that most of our acquisitions will qualify as asset acquisitions rather than business combinations pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations. Upon the acquisition of a property, we assess the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities (including land, buildings, above- and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases, and other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and we allocate the purchase price to them, on a relative fair value basis. The most significant portion of the allocation is generally to building and land and requires the use of market-based estimates and assumptions. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as other available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on several factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. 
 
 The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of acquired intangible assets and liabilities. 
 
 Acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. 
 
 Acquired above- and below-market leases are recorded at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. 
 
 Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.

 Impairment of Investments in Real Estate 
 
 Once real estate assets have been recorded, they are subsequently evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. A real estate asset is considered impaired when the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the real estate asset over the estimated remaining holding period is less than the carrying value of such real estate asset. An impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the real estate asset over the fair value. When determining the fair value of a real estate asset for the purpose of assessing impairment, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to: consideration of projected operating cash flows, intended holding period of the real estate, comparable selling prices and projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the real estate based upon our estimate of a capitalization rate and discount rate. While we exercise significant judgment in generating our assumptions, the asset's fair value is subject to uncertainty, as actual operating cash flows and disposition proceeds could differ from those assumed in our valuations. Additionally, the output is sensitive to the assumptions used in calculating any potential impairment.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The primary components of our market risk are related to interest rates, credit spreads, credit market values, liquidity and foreign currency exchange rates. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe that risk can be quantified from historical experience, and we seek to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. Our net interest income is exposed to interest rate volatility primarily as a result of the floating rate nature of the investments we hold and the financing we place on them. Additionally, we may use company-level facilities featuring floating interest rates for liquidity and working capital purposes. Furthermore, we may make investments in fixed and floating rate debt securities; the value of our positions may increase or decrease depending on interest rate movements. Finally, interest rate changes may impact the demand for loans and the availability of financing needed to expand our investment portfolio. 
 
 A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher debt service payment requirements relative to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. Rising interest rates carry default risk to our borrowers, because cash flows from underlying properties may fall below the debt service payments due to us on the investments, triggering borrower liquidity covenants. Therefore, we expect to protect property cash flows by requiring borrowers to purchase interest rate caps, which provides a hedge against rising interest rates, whereby the borrower will receive excess cash if interest rates exceed predetermined strike prices. Furthermore, rising interest rates also cause our overall cost of borrowing to increase, partially or fully, offsetting any increase in elevated debt service payments received on our variable rate investments. In general, we will seek to match the interest rate characteristics of our investments with the interest rate characteristics of any related financing obligations. In instances where the interest rate characteristics of an investment and the related financing obligation are not matched, we may mitigate such interest rate risk through the utilization of interest rate derivatives of the same duration. Given our target leverage ratios, an increase in interest rates may result in an increase in our net investment income and the amount of the performance participation allocation payable to the Special Limited Partner. 
 
 A decline in interest rates can be expected to lead to lower debt service payments received from any variable rate investments we may hold, decreases in the interest income earned on any floating rate investments we hold, and increases in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. To mitigate the impact of reduced earnings as a result of declining interest rates, we expect to structure interest rate floors into each loan where the borrower will be required 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 to pay minimum interest payments should interest rates fall below a predetermined rate. Additionally, reduced interest rates also cause our overall cost of borrowings to decrease. Because our borrowings do not typically feature interest rate floors, but our variable rate investments feature minimum interest payments due to us, declining interest rates may result in an increase to the Company s net interest income and an increase in the amount of the performance participation allocation payable to the Special Limited Partner. 
 
 Credit Spread Risk 
 
 Credit spread risk is the risk that interest rate spreads between two different financial instruments will change. In general, U.S. fixed-rate commercial mortgage loans and CMBS are priced based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities or interest rate swaps. We will generally benefit if credit spreads narrow during the time that we hold a portfolio of mortgage loans, CMBS and/or collateralized loan obligations ("CLO") investments, and we may experience losses if credit spreads widen during the time that we hold a portfolio of mortgage loans, CMBS and/or CLO investments. We actively monitor our exposure to changes in credit spreads and we may enter into credit total return swaps or take positions in other credit-related derivative instruments to moderate our exposure to losses associated with a widening of credit spreads. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk in our investments with respect to a borrower s ability to make required debt service payments to us and repay the unpaid principal balance in accordance to the terms of the loan agreement. We manage this risk by conducting a credit analysis prior to making an investment and by actively monitoring our portfolio and the underlying credit quality, including subordination and diversification, of our investments on an ongoing basis. In addition, we re-evaluate the credit risk inherent in our investments on a regular basis taking into consideration a number of fundamental macro-economic factors such as gross domestic product, unemployment, interest rates, capital markets activity, retail sales, store closing/openings, corporate earnings, housing inventory, affordability and regional home price trends. 
 
 We are exposed to credit risk with respect to the tenants that occupy properties that serve as collateral to our investments. To mitigate this risk, we seek to avoid large single tenant exposure and we undertake a credit evaluation of major tenants prior to making a loan. This analysis includes extensive due diligence of a potential tenant s creditworthiness and business, as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the property to the tenant s core business operations. 
 
 Finally, we may be exposed to counterparty credit risk under the terms of a derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty will owe us, which creates credit risk for us. If the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we will owe the counterparty and, therefore, do not have credit risk. We may seek to mitigate the credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. 
 
 Market Value Risks 
 
 We may also be exposed to market value risk with respect to the fair value of our investments, including debt securities, and borrowings due to changes in market conditions, including credit spreads, interest rates, property cash flows, and commercial property values that serve as collateral. We seek to manage our exposure to market risk by originating or acquiring investments secured by different property types located in diverse, but liquid markets, with stable credit ratings. The fair value of our investments may fluctuate, therefore the amount we will realize upon any repayment, sale, or an alternative liquidation event is unknown. 
 
 Commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: national, regional and local economic conditions; local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; and retroactive changes to building or similar codes and/or tax and legal considerations. Changes in commercial property values are difficult to predict with accuracy. We model a range of valuation scenarios and the resulting impacts to our investments.

 Liquidity Risk 
 
 Market disruptions may lead to a significant decline in transaction activity in all or a significant portion of the asset classes in which we intend to invest and may at the same time lead to a significant contraction in short-term and long-term debt and equity funding sources. A decline in liquidity of real estate and real estate-related investments, as well as a lack of availability of observable transaction data and inputs, may make it more difficult to sell our investments or determine their fair values. As a result, we may be unable to sell investments, or only be able to sell investments at a price that may be materially different from the fair values presented. Also, in such conditions, there is no guarantee that the Company s borrowing arrangements or other arrangements for obtaining leverage will continue to be available or, if available, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us. In addition, a decline in market value of our assets may have particular adverse consequences in instances where we borrowed money based on the fair value of our assets. A decrease in the market value of the our assets may result in the lender requiring it to post additional collateral or otherwise sell assets at a time when it may not be in our best interest to do so. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Should we acquire any loans and investments that are denominated in a foreign currency, they may be subject to risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates. We generally expect to mitigate this exposure by matching the currency of our foreign currency assets to the currency of the borrowings that finance those assets. As a result, we expect to substantially reduce our exposure to changes in portfolio value related to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 
 We intend to hedge our net currency exposures in a prudent manner. In doing so, we generally expect to structure our foreign currency hedges so that the notional values and expiration dates of our hedges approximate the amounts and timing of future payments we expect to receive on the related investments. However, our currency hedging strategies may not eliminate all of our currency risk due to, among other things, uncertainties in the timing and/or amounts of payments received on the related investments, and/or unequal, inaccurate, or unavailable hedges to perfectly offset changes in future exchange rates. Additionally, we may be required under certain circumstances to collateralize our currency hedges for the benefit of the hedge counterparty, which could adversely affect our liquidity. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q was made under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Financial Officer CFO and Head of Capital Markets, and our Chief Accounting Officer CAO and Treasurer. Based upon this evaluation, our CFO and Head of Capital Markets, and our CAO and Treasurer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (a) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms and (b) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CFO and Head of Capital Markets, and our CAO and Treasurer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Share Repurchase Plan 
 
 Our board of trustees adopted a share repurchase plan (the Share Repurchase Plan ), pursuant to which shareholders may request on a quarterly basis that the Company repurchase all or any portion of their common shares, subject to certain limitations as set forth therein. The aggregate NAV of total repurchases of our common shares 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 (including repurchases at certain non-U.S. investor access funds primarily created to hold shares of our shares) is limited to no more than 5 of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter (measured using the average aggregate NAV as of the end of each of the immediately preceding three months). Shares or units issued to the Adviser and the Special Limited Partner pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or with respect to the performance participation allocation, respectively, are not subject to these repurchase limitations. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares and may choose to repurchase only some, or even none, of the shares that have been requested to be repurchased in any particular quarter in our discretion. In addition, our ability to fulfill repurchase requests is subject to a number of limitations. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. Under our share repurchase plan, to the extent we choose to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we will only repurchase shares as of the opening of the last business day of that quarter (each such date, a Repurchase Date ). Repurchases will be made at the transaction price in effect on the Repurchase Date, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at 98 of the transaction price. The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. 
 
 The table below sets forth common share repurchases by the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2024 under the share repurchase plan: 
 
 Repurchase Date: Total Number of Common Shares Repurchased Average Purchase Price Paid per Share (1)

 (1) Repurchase price was reflective of 98 of NAV per share as of August 31, 2024 for each share class because the repurchased shares were not outstanding for at least one year as set forth in our share repurchase plan described above. 
 (2) Repurchases are limited as set forth in our share repurchase plan described above. All requests under the share repurchase plan were satisfied. 
 (3) Repurchases are limited as set forth in our share repurchase plan described above. All requests under the share repurchase plan were satisfied.
