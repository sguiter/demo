 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (In thousands except share and per share data) 

The Work Truck Solutions segment has four revenue streams, as identified below. 
 
 State and Local Bids The Company records revenue of separately sold snow and ice equipment upon shipment and fully upfit vehicles upon delivery. The state and local bid process does not obligate the entity to buy any products from the Company, but merely allows the entity to purchase products in the future, typically for a fixed period of time. The entity commits to actually purchasing products from the Company when it issues purchase orders off of a previously awarded bid, which lists out actual quantities of equipment being ordered and the delivery terms. On upfit transactions, the Company is providing a significant service by assembling and integrating the individual products onto the customer s truck. Each individual product and installation activity is highly interdependent and highly interrelated, and therefore the Company considers the manufacture and upfit of a truck a single performance obligation. Any shipping and handling activities performed by the Company after the transfer of control to the Customer (e.g., when control transfers upon shipment) are considered fulfillment activities, and accordingly, the costs are accrued for when the related revenue is recognized. 
 
 Fleet Upfit Sales The Company enters into contracts with certain fleet customers. Fleet agreements create enforceable rights without the issuance of a purchase order. Typically, these agreements outline the terms of sale, payment terms, standard pricing, and the rights of the customer and seller. Fleet sales are performed on both customer owned vehicles as well as non-customer owned vehicles. For non-customer owned vehicles, revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the truck to the customer. For customer-owned vehicles, per Topic 606, revenue is recognized over time based on a cost input method. The Company accumulates costs incurred on partially completed customer-owned upfits based on estimated margin and completion. 
 
 Dealer Upfit Sales The Company upfits work trucks for independent dealer customers. Dealer upfit revenue is recorded upon delivery. The customer does not own the vehicles during the upfit process, and as such revenue is recorded at a point in time upon delivery to the customer. 
 
 Over the Counter / Parts Accessory Sales Work Truck Solutions part and accessory sales are recorded as revenue upon shipment. Additionally, customers can purchase parts at any of the Company s showrooms. In these instances, each product is considered a separate performance obligation, and revenue is recognized upon shipment of the goods or customer pick up. 

Disaggregation of Revenue 
 
 The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by customer type and timing of revenue recognition, and includes a reconciliation of the disaggregated revenue with reportable segments.

 The following table shows the changes in the Company s contract liabilities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively: 

The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Contract assets include amounts related to the contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations. There were contract assets as of September 30, 2024 or 2023 . Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract, variable freight allowances which are refunded to the customer, and rebates paid to distributors under our municipal rebate program, and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract. 
 
 The Company recognized revenue of and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, which was included in contract liabilities at the beginning of each period. The Company recognized revenue of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, which was included in contract liabilities at the beginning of each period.

(a) Included in Non-qualified benefit plan assets is the cash surrender value of insurance policies on various individuals that are associated with the Company. The carrying amount of these insurance policies approximates their fair value and is considered Level 2 inputs. The Company had outstanding loans of and against these Non-qualified benefit plan assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, included in Other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. 
 
 (b) Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model (e.g. interest rates and credit spreads). Model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data. A credit risk adjustment is made on each swap using observable market credit spreads. Thus, inputs used to determine fair value of the interest rate swap are Level 2 inputs. Interest rate swaps of and at September 30, 2024 are included in Prepaid and other current assets and Other long-term assets, respectively. Interest rate swaps of and at December 31, 2023 are included in Prepaid and other current assets and Other long-term assets, respectively. 
 
 (c) The fair value of the Company s long-term debt, including current maturities, approximates its carrying value. Long-term debt is recorded at carrying amount, net of discount and deferred debt issuance costs, as disclosed on the face of the balance sheet. 

Work-in-process 
 Raw material and supplies 

The inventories in the table above do not include truck chassis inventory financed through a floor plan financing agreement, which are recorded separately on the balance sheet. The Company takes title to truck chassis upon receipt of the inventory through its floor plan agreement and performs upfitting service installations to the truck chassis inventory during the installation period. The floor plan obligation is then assumed by the dealer customer upon delivery. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had and , respectively, of chassis inventory and and of related floor plan financing obligation, respectively. The Company recognizes revenue associated with upfitting and service installations net of the truck chassis.

Certain of the Company s leases contain escalating rental payments based on an index. The Company s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company closed on a sale leaseback transaction with an unrelated third party. Under this transaction, the Company sold properties with a combined net book value of for gross proceeds of , which was reduced by transaction costs of for net cash proceeds of approximately .

 The Company is required to pay a fee for unused amounts under the senior secured revolving facility in an amount ranging from to of the average daily unused portion of the senior secured revolving credit facility, depending on Douglas Dynamics, L.L.C.'s ("DDI LLC") Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides that the senior secured term loan facility will bear interest at (i) the Term SOFR Rate for the applicable interest period plus (ii) a margin ranging from to 2.00 , depending on the DDI LLC s Leverage Ratio. The Credit Agreement provides that the Revolving Loan Borrowers have the option to select whether the senior secured revolving credit facility borrowings will bear interest at either (i)(a) the Term SOFR Rate for the applicable interest period plus (b) plus (c) a margin ranging from to , depending on DDI LLC s Leverage Ratio, or (ii) a margin ranging from to per annum, depending on DDI LLC s Leverage Ratio, plus the greatest of (which if the following would be less than , such rate shall be deemed to be (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the NYFRB Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus and (c) the Term SOFR Rate for a one month interest plus (the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate ). If the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for the applicable interest period is less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of calculating the foregoing interest rates in the Credit Agreement.

 The Credit Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and negative and affirmative covenants, as well as customary events of default and certain cross default provisions that could result in acceleration of the Credit Agreement. In addition, as a result of the modifications to the minimum required Leverage Ratio under Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement as discussed above, the Credit Agreement requires the Company to have a Leverage Ratio of (i) to 1.00 for each Reference Period ending on or prior to September 30, 2023, ii) to 1.00 for the Reference Period ending on December 31, 2023, iii) to 1.00 for each Reference Period ending on March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and (iv) to 1.00 for each Reference Period ending on September 30, 2024 and thereafter, and to have a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter commencing with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021.

shares of common stock were available for issuance pursuant to all awards under the 2010 Plan prior to the time that the 2010 Plan was suspended, as described below. 
 
 In February 2024, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the 2024 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan ), which was subsequently approved by stockholders in April 2024. The 2024 Plan provides for the issuance of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units RSUs ), any of which may be performance-based, and for incentive bonuses, which may be paid in cash or stock or a combination of both, to eligible employees, officers, non-employee directors and other service providers to the Company and its subsidiaries. A maximum of shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to all awards under the 2024 Plan. At the time that the stockholders approved the 2024 Plan, it replaced the 2010 Plan, and no further awards may be issued under the 2010 Plan. Awards that remain outstanding under the 2010 Plan will remain outstanding under the 2010 Plan in accordance with their terms. 
 
 Equity awards issued to management under either the 2010 Plan or the 2024 Plan include a retirement provision under which members of management who either 1 are age 65 or older or 2 have at least ten years of service and are at least age 55 will continue to vest in unvested equity awards upon retirement. The retirement provision also stipulates that the employee remain employed by the Company for six months after the first day of the fiscal year of the grant. As the retirement provision does not qualify as a substantive service condition, the Company incurred and in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, in additional expense for employees who meet the thresholds of the retirement provision. In 2013, the Company s Nominating and Governance Committee of its Board of Directors approved a retirement provision for the RSUs issued to non-employee directors that accelerates the vesting of such awards upon retirement. Such awards are fully expensed immediately upon grant in accordance with ASC 718, as the retirement provision eliminates substantive service conditions associated with the awards. 
 
 Performance Share Unit Awards 
 
 The Company has granted performance share units as performance-based awards under the 2010 Plan that are subject to performance conditions over a three year performance period beginning in the year of the grant and, beginning with the 2024 grant, includes three 1 -year measurement periods, as well as a vesting component based on a Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") modifier tied to the Company's relative total shareholder return in comparison to the total shareholder return of the S P Small Cap 600 Industrials market index. The total number of shares issued pursuant to performance share units may be increased, decreased, or unchanged based on this TSR modifier. Upon meeting the prescribed performance conditions, employees will be issued shares which vest immediately at the end of the performance period. In accordance with ASC 718, such awards are being expensed over the vesting period from the date of grant through the requisite service period, based upon the most probable outcome. For the 2024 grants, a Monte Carlo simulation has been used to account for the TSR market condition in the grant date fair value of the award, which was per share. 
 
 The Company recognized and of compensation expense related to the awards in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The Company recognized and of compensation expense related to the awards in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares that were, as of September 30, 2024 , expected to be earned through the requisite service period was approximately and is expected to be recognized through 2027 . 
 
 Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
 
 RSUs are granted to both non-employee directors and management. RSUs do not carry voting rights. While all non-employee director RSUs participate in dividend equivalents, there are two potential classes of management RSUs: one that participates in dividend equivalents, and a second that does not participate in dividend equivalents. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company s common stock and is subject to time-based vesting restrictions. Participants are not required to pay any consideration to the Company at either the time of grant of a RSU or upon vesting. 

A summary of RSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows: 

Granted 
 Vested - 
 Cancelled and forfeited - 
 
 Unvested at September 30, 2024

The Company recognized and of compensation expense related to the RSU awards in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares that were, as of September 30, 2024 , expected to be earned through the requisite service period was approximately and is expected to be recognized through 2027 . 
 
 For grants to non-employee directors, vesting occurs as of the grant date. Vested director RSUs are settled by the delivery to the participant or a designated brokerage firm of one share of common stock per vested RSU as soon as reasonably practicable following a termination of service of the participant that constitutes a separation from service, or as soon as reasonably practicable upon grant if such election is made by the non-employee director, and in all events no later than the end of the calendar year in which such termination of service occurs or, if later, two and one -half months after such termination of service. Vested management RSUs are settled by the delivery to the participant or a designated brokerage firm of one share of common stock per vested RSU as soon as reasonably practicable following vesting. 

Segment performance is evaluated based on segment net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. Segment results include an allocation of all corporate costs. No single customer s revenues amounted to 10 or more of the Company s total revenue. Sales are primarily within the United States and substantially all assets are located within the United States.

Results of Operations 
 
 The Company s two reportable business segments are as follows: 
 
 Work Truck Attachments. The Work Truck Attachments segment includes commercial snow and ice management attachments sold under the FISHER , WESTERN and SNOWEX brands, as well as our vertically integrated products. This segment consists of our operations that manufacture and sell snow and ice control products. As described under Seasonality and Year-To-Year Variability, the Work Truck Attachments Segment is seasonal and, as a result, its results of operations can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year. 
 
 Work Truck Solutions. The Work Truck Solutions segment includes manufactured municipal snow and ice control products under the HENDERSON brand and the up-fit of market leading attachments and storage solutions under the HENDERSON brand, and the DEJANA brand and its related sub-brands. 
 
 In addition, segment results include an allocation of all corporate costs to Work Truck Attachments and Work Truck Solutions. 
 
 Business Update 
 
 As a result of recent market volatility, supply chain disruptions, labor strikes, labor shortages, inflationary pressures (including around materials, freight, labor and benefits) and other economic trends, our results of operations were impacted in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and may be significantly impacted in future quarters. See below for further discussion of the impact to our financial statements. We may have challenges in short-term liquidity that could impact our ability to fund working capital needs. We have taken various steps to preserve liquidity. In January 2024, we implemented the 2024 Cost Savings Program, which is primarily in the form of restructuring charges for salaried headcount reductions and impacted both the Work Truck Attachments segment and corporate functions. We are also reducing discretionary spending where possible and deferring payments where appropriate within existing contractual terms, while remaining committed to long term growth projects. As discussed in Note 7 and Note 9 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in September 2024, we executed a sale leaseback transaction for gross proceeds of 64.2 million, and, using a portion of the proceeds, we paid down 42.0 million on our term loan. In addition, as discussed in Note 9 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in January 2023, we expanded the borrowing capacity of our revolving credit facility, and in January 2024, we amended our Credit Agreement to increase the minimum required leverage ratio from December 31, 2023 through June 30, 2024. In consideration of these recent macroeconomic trends and the various actions that we have taken to preserve our liquidity, we expect that cash on hand and cash we generate from operations, as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities, will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Effective July 8, 2024, Robert McCormick retired as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. McCormick's agreement allows him to provide consulting services to the Company through December 31, 2024. Effective July 8, 2024, James Janik was elected as the Company's Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.

The decrease in sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to low snowfall in our core markets leading to lower volumes in 2024. The most recent snow season ended March 2024 was approximately 39.0 below the 10-year average.

The increase in sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was a result of price increase realization, as well as higher sales of Company-purchased chassis, which are typically sold at cost. The increase in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was a result of higher volumes on improved throughput, price increase realization, as well as higher sales of Company-purchased chassis, which are typically sold at cost. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales was 98.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 112.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 13.5 million or 12.1 . Cost of sales was 313.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 329.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 15.3 million or 4.6 . The decrease in cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by the lower volumes at Work Truck Attachments. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales were 76.1 and 73.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 77.7 and 75.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower spending in conjunction with our 2024 Cost Savings Plan. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit was 30.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 32.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.2 million, or 3.7 . Gross profit was 111.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 104.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.3 million, or 6.0 . The change in gross profit is attributable to the changes in sales as discussed above under Net Sales. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 22.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.9 for the corresponding period in 2024. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 24.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 26.1 for the corresponding period in 2024. The reasons for the change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales are the same as those relating to the changes in cost of sales as a percentage of sales discussed above under Cost of Sales.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, were 27.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.7 million, or 32.5 . Selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, were 76.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 72.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.9 million, or 5.4 . The increase in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is related to 5.2 million in transaction costs related to the sale leaseback transaction, 1.0 million in CEO transition costs, higher stock-based compensation of 0.8 million, and higher incentive-based compensation of 0.6 million, somewhat offset by lower intangibles amortization of 1.0 million related to an asset becoming fully amortized when compared to the prior year, as well as cost savings related to our 2024 Cost Savings Program. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to 5.2 million in transaction costs related to the sale leaseback transaction, 1.0 million in CEO transition costs, and an increase in employee benefits costs of 0.7 million and severance costs of 0.9 million related to salaried headcount reductions at our Work Truck Attachments segment and our corporate function as part of our 2024 Cost Savings Program. These increases in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are somewhat offset by lower intangibles amortization of 2.0 million related to an asset becoming fully amortized when compared to the prior year, lower stock-based compensation of 0.6 million and incentive-based compensation of 0.3 million, as well as a decrease in advertising costs of 0.6 million and travel costs of 0.6 million related to curtailed discretionary spending. 
 
 Impairment Charges 
 
 Impairment charges were 1.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.0 million in the same period in the prior year. The impairment charges in 2024 relate to certain internally developed software at our Work Truck Attachments segment and represent the full capitalized value of the software. 
 
 Gain on Sale Leaseback Transaction 
 
 Gain on sale leaseback transaction was 42.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.0 million in the same periods in the prior year, see Note 7 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale leaseback transaction. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Interest expense was 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease compared to the 4.6 million incurred in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower interest on our revolver of 0.4 million due to having lower revolver borrowings during the quarter compared to the prior year, somewhat offset by higher interest on our floor plan agreement, see Note 5 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the floor plan agreement. Interest expense was 12.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase compared to the 11.2 million incurred in the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to higher interest on our floor plan agreement of 0.8 million. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 22.7 and 16.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was 24.5 and 20.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by a tax benefit related to the purchase of investment tax credits included in the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions of 0.4 million. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the establishment of reserves for uncertain tax positions of 0.9 million. 
 
 Net Income 
 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 32.3 million, compared to 5.8 million for the corresponding period in 2023, an increase of 26.5 million. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 48.2 million, compared to 16.6 million for the corresponding period in 2023, an increase of 31.6 million. The change in net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the factors described above under Net Sales, Cost of Sales, Selling, General and Administrative Expense, Impairment Charges, Gain on Sale Leaseback Transaction, Interest Expense," and Income Taxes. As a percentage of net sales, net income was 24.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, net income was 11.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in our Form 10-K (Commission File No. 001-34728) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our principal sources of cash have been, and we expect will continue to be, cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities. 

32

Table of Contents 

Our primary uses of cash are to provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, finance capital expenditures, pay dividends under our dividend policy and support our growth, including through potential acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. For a description of the seasonality of our working capital rates see Seasonality and Year-To-Year Variability. 
 
 Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including our financial condition and earnings, legal requirements, taxes and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. The terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances. As a result of this dividend policy, we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements. As a result, we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason. 
 
 On February 16, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 50.0 million in shares of common stock at market value . This authorization does not have an expiration date. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company s discretion. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 90.9 million of total liquidity, comprised of 8.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 82.5 million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, compared with total liquidity as of December 31, 2023 of approximately 126.7 million, comprised of approximately 24.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately 102.5 million under our revolving credit facility. The change in our total liquidity from December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the seasonality of our business. In addition, as discussed in Note 7 and Note 9 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in September 2024 we executed a sale leaseback transaction for gross proceeds of 64.2 million, and using a portion of the proceeds we paid down 42.0 million on our term loan. We have taken various steps to preserve liquidity. In January 2024, we implemented the 2024 Cost Savings Program, which is primarily in the form of restructuring charges for salaried headcount reductions and impacted both the Work Truck Attachments segment and corporate functions. We are also continuing to reduce discretionary spending where possible and deferring payments where appropriate within existing contractual terms, while remaining committed to long term growth projects. We expect that cash on hand and cash we generate from operations, as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities, will provide adequate funds for the primary uses of cash we describe above for the foreseeable future. From time to time, we may seek additional funding through the issuance of debt or equity securities to provide additional liquidity to fund acquisitions aligned with our strategic priorities and for other general corporate purposes. 
 
 The following table shows our cash and cash equivalents, net accounts receivable and inventories at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023.

Net cash used in operating activities decreased 30.9 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was due to a 7.7 million decrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items, and favorable changes in working capital of 38.5 million. The largest favorable changes in working capital were a decrease in cash used in accounts payable related to the timing of supplier payments, a decrease in cash used for accounts receivable related to strong collections, as well as a decrease in cash used for inventory related reduced inventory levels in 2024. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities increased 68.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023 due to gross proceeds on the sale leaseback transaction of 64.2 million, as well as a lower level of capital expenditures. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 105.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in cash provided was related to having 67.0 million in revolver borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 47.0 million in revolver borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2023, compared to 101.0 million in revolver borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2023 and no revolver borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022. See Note 9 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the increase in cash used in financing activities is related to a 42.0 million voluntary pre-payment of debt amortization principal payments in September 2024 using a portion of the proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction, in comparison to a 10.0 million repayment of long-term debt related to a voluntary pre-payment of debt amortization principal payments in 2023; see Note 9 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 Free cash flow for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 15.4) million compared to 0.4) million in the corresponding period in 2023, a decrease of 15.0 million. Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 37.3) million compared to 71.9) million in the corresponding period in 2023, an increase of 34.6 million. The increase in free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily a result of lower cash used in operating activities of 30.9 million as discussed above under Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by (used in) operations. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. 
 
 The following table reconciles net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, a GAAP measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, severance, restructuring charges, impairment charges, CEO transition costs, insurance proceeds, gain on sale leaseback transaction and related transaction costs, and stock-based compensation. We use, and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of, Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies, because it allows them to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Our management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with our senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. As a result, you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure; and 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred.

Adjusted EBITDA at our Work Truck Attachments segment was 39.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 44.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4.9 million. The change in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding periods in 2023 was due to low snowfall in our core markets leading to lower volumes in 2024. The most recent snow season ended March 2024 was approximately 39.0 below the 10-year average. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA at our Work Truck Solutions segment was 7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA at our Work Truck Solutions segment was 21.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 12.3 million. The change in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to improved volumes and price increase realization, as well as improved efficiencies.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (calculated on a diluted basis) represents net income and earnings per share (as defined by GAAP), excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, severance, restructuring charges, impairment charges, CEO transition costs, insurance proceeds, gain on sale leaseback transaction and related transaction costs, certain charges related to unrelated legal fees and consulting fees, and adjustments on derivatives not classified as hedges, net of their income tax impact. Adjustments on derivatives not classified as hedges are non-cash and are related to overall financial market conditions; therefore, management believes such costs are unrelated to our business and are not representative of our results. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful in assessing the Company s financial performance by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net income for the periods presented allows investors to make meaningful comparisons of our operating performance between periods and to view our business from the same perspective as our management. Because the excluded items are not predictable or consistent, management does not consider them when evaluating our performance or when making decisions regarding allocation of resources.

Future Obligations and Commitments 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed on a sale leaseback transaction with an unrelated third party. The properties in the sale leaseback transaction are comprised of three facilities located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and four additional facilities located in each of Huntley, Illinois; Manchester, Iowa; Rockland, Maine; and Madison Heights, Michigan, totaling approximately 780,000 square feet of manufacturing and upfitting space. The lease agreement has an initial term of 15 years, with two optional 10-year renewal options. The resulting lease has approximately 88.9 million in committed future lease payments over the next 15 years. 
 
 With the exception of the lease commitments described above, there have been no material changes to our future obligations and commitments in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Impact of Inflation 
 
 Inflation in materials and labor had a material impact on our profitability in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and, although we are starting to see such inflationary pressures ease, we expect ongoing inflationary pressures may also impact our profitability in the remainder of 2024. While we anticipate being able to cover this inflation by raising prices, there may be a timing difference of when we incur the increased costs and when we realize the higher prices in our backlog. In 2023 and in previous years, including in 2019, as a result of inflationary pressures due to tariffs, we experienced significant increases in steel costs, but were able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges; we expect, but cannot be certain, that we will be able to do the same going forward. 
 
 Seasonality and Year-to-Year Variability 
 
 While our Work Truck Solutions segment has limited seasonality and variability, our Work Truck Attachments segment is seasonal and also varies from year-to-year. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition for this segment vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as well. In addition, because of this seasonality and variability, the results of operations for our Work Truck Attachments segment and our consolidated results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year, and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years. That being the case, while snowfall levels vary within a given year and from year-to-year, snowfall, and the corresponding replacement cycle of snow and ice control equipment manufactured and sold by our Work Truck Attachments segment, is relatively consistent over multi-year periods. 
 
 Sales of our Work Truck Attachments products are significantly impacted by the level, timing and location of snowfall, with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season (which we consider to begin in October and end in March) in that region. This is due to the fact that end-user demand for our Work Truck Attachments products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment, and in the case of professional snowplowers, by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment, both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels. Heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our Work Truck Attachments products to increase, resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles, thereby creating a need for replacement commercial snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories. In addition, when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter, the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement commercial snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter. To a lesser extent, sales of our Work Truck Attachments products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter. Because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season, our end-users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather than delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end-users. 
 
 We attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our revenues in part through our pre-season sales program, which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre-season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our Work Truck Attachments distributors a combination of pricing, payment and freight incentives during this period. These pre-season sales incentives encourage our Work Truck Attachments distributors to re-stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering pre-season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter. As a result, we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales (an average of over two-thirds over the last ten years) for the Work Truck Attachments segment during the second and third quarters, providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year. By contrast, our revenue and operating results for the Work Truck Attachments segment tend to be lowest during the first quarter, as management believes our end-users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre-season sales incentive period to re-stock inventory. Fourth quarter sales for the Work Truck Attachments segment vary from year-to-year as they are primarily driven by the level, timing and location of snowfall during the quarter. This is because most of our fourth quarter sales and shipments for the Work Truck Attachments segment consist of re-orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months.

Because of the seasonality of our sales of Work Truck Attachments products, we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well. In the first quarter, we typically require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory for the Work Truck Attachments segment in anticipation of our second and third quarter pre-season sales. During the second and third quarters, our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivable for the Work Truck Attachments segment increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre-season sales program, and as we continue to build inventory. Working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivable for the Work Truck Attachments segment when we receive the majority of the payments for pre-season shipped products. 
 
 We also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year-to-year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets. Our asset management and profit focus strategies include: 

the employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate, which allows us to adjust costs on an as-needed basis in response to changing demand; 

our enterprise-wide lean concept, which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand; 

the pre-season order program described above, which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season; and 

a vertically integrated business model. 

These asset management and profit focus strategies, among other management tools, allow us to adjust fixed overhead and selling, general and administrative expenditures to account for the year-to-year variability of our sales volumes. 
 
 Additionally, although our annual capital expenditures are modest, they can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately 40 in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes. If we are unsuccessful in our asset management initiatives, the seasonality and year-to-year variability effects on our business may be compounded and in turn our results of operations and financial condition may suffer. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We do not use financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, and do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk. Other than the broad effects of recent macro-economic trends and their negative impact on the global economy and major financial markets, our primary market risk exposures are changes in interest rates and steel price fluctuations. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Our borrowings, including our term loan and any revolving borrowings under our senior credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. A portion of our interest rate risk associated with our term loan is mitigated through interest rate swaps. In addition, the interest rate on any revolving borrowings is subject to an increase in the interest rate based on our average daily availability under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under our term loan of 147.5 million. A hypothetical interest rate change of 1 , 1.5 and 2 on our term loan would have changed interest incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 0.2 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 
 The Company is party to interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate volatility. On June 9, 2021, in conjunction with entering into the Credit Agreement described above, the Company re-designated its swap. As a result, the swap will be recorded at fair value with changes recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The amortization from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings from the previous dedesignation has been adjusted as of June 9, 2021 to include the de-recognition of previously recognized mark-to-market gains and the amortization of the off-market component as of the re-designation date, and will continue to be recognized through the life of the swap. On May 19, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to further reduce its exposure to interest rate volatility. The interest rate swap has a notional amount of 125,000 effective for the period May 31, 2024 through June 9, 2026. The Company may have counterparty credit risk resulting from the interest rate swap, which it monitors on an on-going basis. The risk lies with two global financial institutions. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the Company will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 2.718 and SOFR. The interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge. See Note 9 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our interest rate swap agreements.

As of September 30, 2024, we had 67.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. A hypothetical interest rate change of 1 , 1.5 and 2 on our revolving credit facility would have changed interest incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 0.2 million, 0.3 million, and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk related to our purchase of steel, the primary commodity upon which our manufacturing depends. Our steel purchases as a percentage of revenue were 5.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our steel purchases as a percentage of revenue were 7.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 10.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While steel is typically available from numerous suppliers, the price of steel is a commodity subject to fluctuations that apply across broad spectrums of the steel market. We do not use any derivative or hedging instruments to manage steel price risk. If the price of steel increases, our variable costs could also increase. While historically we have successfully mitigated these increased costs through the implementation of either permanent price increases and/or temporary invoice surcharges, there may be timing differences between when we realize the price increases and incur the increased costs, and in the future we may not be able to successfully mitigate these costs, which could cause our gross margins to decline. If our costs for steel were to increase by 1.00 in a period where we are not able to pass any of this increase onto our distributors, our gross margins would decline by 1.00 in the period in which such inventory was sold. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We are currently in the process of an enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system implementation at our Dejana Truck Utility Equipment Company, LLC subsidiary. The ERP system is expected to be fully implemented in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of the implementation, we expect certain changes to our processes and procedures, which, in turn, will result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. While we expect this implementation to either strengthen or have minimal impact to our existing internal controls, we will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal control over financial reporting as processes and procedures are finalized with the implementation. 
 
 With the exception of the implementation of the ERP system described above, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are engaged in various litigation matters primarily including product liability and intellectual property disputes. However, management does not believe that any current litigation is material to our operations or financial position. In addition, we are not currently party to any environmental-related claims or legal matters.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There been no significant changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 except for the addition of the following risk to be included in the Risks Related to our Business and Operations subsection. 
 
 The process of implementing an ERP system at Dejana could adversely impact our ability to produce timely financial statements or our internal control over financial reporting. 

We are currently in the process of an ERP implementation at our Dejana Truck Utility Equipment Company, LLC subsidiary, which will replace their current system. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without delays related to resource constraints or challenges with the design or testing phases of the implementation. Inefficiencies in our financial reporting processes due to the conversion to a new ERP could adversely affect our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis until the new ERP and processes have matured. Additionally, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected if the new ERP is not successfully implemented. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 On February 16, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 50.0 million in shares of common stock at market value (the 2022 repurchase plan ). This authorization does not have an expiration date. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases depending on market conditions and corporate needs. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. This program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company s discretion. Shares repurchased under the 2022 repurchase plan are retired. 
 
 Total share repurchases under the 2022 repurchase plan for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are as follows:
