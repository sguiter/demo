The
Company treats a contract as a lease when the contract conveys the right to use a physically distinct asset for a period in exchange
for consideration, or the Company directs the use of the asset and obtains substantially all the economic benefits of the asset. These
leases are recorded as right-of-use ROU assets and lease obligation liabilities for leases with terms greater than 12
months. ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the entirety of the lease term. Lease liabilities
represent the Company s obligation to make payments over the life of the lease. A ROU asset and a lease liability are recognized
at commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the life of the lease. Initial direct costs are included
as part of the ROU asset upon commencement of the lease. Since the interest rate implicit in a lease is generally not readily determinable
for the operating leases, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental
borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar lease
term to obtain an asset of similar value. 

The
Company reviews the impairment of ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for the Company s other long-lived assets. The
Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying
value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the Company s ability to recover the
carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. The Company elected the
practical expedient to exclude short-term leases (leases with original terms of 12 months or less) from ROU asset and lease liability
accounts.

OVERVIEW 

The

in compounding pharmaceuticals and telemedicine through its wholly owned subsidiaries RxCompound, Peaks, and ESF. 

RxCompound

ESF
is a favored entity of ETST, effectively being a non-profit organization that was incorporated on February 11, 2019, and is structured
to accept grants and donations to help those in need of assistance in paying for prescriptions.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Salaries
expense increased to 3,605,954, this is attributable to the rapid growth the Company has experienced, hence the necessity to hire
new employees, and the executive team s new compensation agreement has been put in place. 

General and administrative expenses increase from 93,962 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,259,422, this is due to the area managers fees to support clients out of state , for the six months
ended September 30, 2024 increased from 161,462 to 2,580,405.

Bank
charges for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totalled 271,452, this is directly related to credit card processing fees. 

Marketing
expenses totaled 152,520 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 5,148 for three months ended on September 30, 2023, this
increase had been contemplated by management as part of the strategic plan to increase sales, for the six months ended September 30, 2024 marketing expense was 363,966
versus 16,524 in 2023. 

Legal and professional fees totaled 63,259 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, and 407,626 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

We
are a smaller reporting company, as defined by 17 CFR 229.10(f)(1). We do not consider the impact of inflation and changing prices
as having a material effect on our net sales and revenues and on income from our operations for the previous two years or from continuing
operations going forward. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 2,843 vs 34,911 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. This 92 reduction
of interest expense is attributable to the Company paying off a large portion of its long-term debt. 

We
use Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner
that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplements the information provided by our GAAP measures. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined by us as EBITDA (net income (loss) plus depreciation expense, amortization expense, interest and income tax expense, minus income
tax benefit), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We use Adjusted EBITDA
because we believe it more clearly highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial
measures, since Adjusted EBITDA eliminates from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. 

We
use Adjusted EBITDA in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Quarterly Report, and believe
that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with
greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures
alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in making period-to-period comparison of results
because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. 

Adjusted
EBITDA is not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures
used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated
financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.

Not
applicable to a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. 

The
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness
of the Company s design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that review and evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report,
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures contain components of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s
principal executive and financial officer and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company. 

Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

The
Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation
Date. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). The COSO framework is based upon five integrated
components of control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communications and ongoing monitoring. 

Based
on an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of, the Company s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Company management has concluded that the Company s internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act was reasonably effective as of the
Evaluation Date, and will continue to improve, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the
Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control and Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the company has continued to make process improvement changes in the internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to significantly improve the internal control over financial reporting. The impact of these changes
made is still under evaluation as of the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
