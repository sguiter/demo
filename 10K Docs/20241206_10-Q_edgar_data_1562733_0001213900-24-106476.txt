During both the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we focused on developing our currently owned brands into new markets and by product extensions. Our

launch of our FOCUSfactor vision product line to some of our major retailers in 2023, and (ii) a delay in a significant shipment of FOCUSfactor
supplements due to packaging upgrade in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was due primarily to sales volume increases in 2023, as
prices for our products did not decrease year-over-year. We had a decrease in Consumer Goods revenue in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to
no longer selling consumer goods products. 

Cost of Revenue

Key Near-Term Initiatives 

We intend to organically grow
our current product lines by developing and launching new products and expanding into new markets. Specifically, for FOCUSfactor, we are
working on increased distribution for our recently launched ready-to-drink beverage. Lastly, we intend to grow further through additional
strategic acquisitions and we continue to evaluate opportunities and candidates that we believe fit well with our brand portfolio. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

ended September 30, 2024, and during the year ended December 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Inflation 

The effect of inflation on
our operating results was not significant in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting
estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key accounting policies,
which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in
Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report includes Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company, we have elected
not to provide the disclosure required by this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management, under the supervision
and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, (i) the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
to ensure that material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission ), and (ii) the Company s controls
and procedures have not been designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

38 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 

We are not party to any material legal proceedings.
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. The outcome
of litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. In addition, regardless
of the outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us, which may be material because of defense and settlement costs,
diversion of resources and other factors. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2
of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Quarterly Report. However, as of the date of this Quarterly Report,
there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in the Risk Factors section
of the Prospectus. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results
of operations. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings
with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
and Use of Proceeds 

(a) None. 

(b) On October 22, 2024, our registration statement
on Form S-1 (File No. 333-282780), as amended (the Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC for our underwritten
initial public offering in which we sold a total of 1,150,000 shares of our common stock, par value 0.00001 per share, at price to the
public of 9.00 per share, for gross proceeds of 10,350,000. Roth Capital Partners, LLC acted as representative of the underwriters for
the offering. 

The offering closed on October 24, 2024 (the initial
public offering ). Following the sale of all the shares upon the closing of the initial public offering and the expiration of the
over-allotment option, the offering terminated. We received net proceeds of approximately 8.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and the estimated offering expenses. No payments for such expenses were made directly or indirectly to (i) any of our
officers or directors or their associates, (ii) any persons owning 10 or more of any class of our equity securities, or (iii) any of
our affiliates. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering as described in the
Prospectus. 

(c) None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not applicable. 

39 

Item 5. Other Information. 

(a) None. 

(b) In connection with the initial public offering,
the Company adopted the amended and restated bylaws, which, among other things, set forth certain procedures by which our shareholders
may recommend nominees to our board of directors. 

(c) During the quarter ended September 30, 2024,
no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1
