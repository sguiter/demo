 and an accumulated deficit of . The Company has incurred losses since its inception and has used cash from operations of during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to successfully commercialize its products, successfully launch future products, obtain additional capital, if necessary, and ultimately attain profitable operations. The Company has funded its operations primarily through its preferred stock issuances, debt financing arrangements, and through the sale of shares of the Company s common stock. The Company completed its initial public offering of the Company s common stock in April of 2021 (the IPO and completed a follow-on public offering of the Company s common stock in June of 2023, as further described in Note 10. There can be no assurance that additional financings will be available to the Company or that the Company will become profitable. The Company s debt financing with Midcap Financial Trust (the Midcap Trust Term Lo an is subject to minimum financial covenants. Based on the Company s current operating plan, the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to maintain compliance with these financial covenants for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financials, which could result in additional cash resources being required if the Company s Midcap Trust Term Loan becomes due. The Company intends to seek a waiver, refinance the outstanding borrowings or otherwise mitigate these concerns with Midcap Financial Trust or another lender. There can be no assurance that a waiver will be granted or that the Company will be able to refinance the amounts outstanding and in such an event, the lender may exercise any and all of its rights and remedies provided for under the Midcap Trust Term loan. As a result of these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months following the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

 . Such amendment was accounted for as a modification to the existing contract. The Company is entitled to be paid through an upfront payment and at the achievement of certain developmental, commercial, and FDA milestones during the development that could aggregate to . A portion of these payments have been received from June 2022 through September 30, 2024. The Acrivon Agreement is in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company concluded that the Acrivon Agreement contains one performance obligation for certain development services, since the underlying elements are inputs to a single development service and are not distinct within the context of the contract. Additional development services in the Acrivon Agreement were deemed to be an option, due to certain contingencies with significant uncertainty. The Company will recognize revenue over time for the transaction price in an amount proportional to the expenses incurred and the total estimated expenses to satisfy its performance obligation. The costs incurred by the Company under this arrangement are included as research and development expenses in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as these costs are related to the development of new services and technology to be owned and offered by the Company.

 Consumables Standalone software products Total product revenue Service and other revenue Service and other revenue Instrument warranty Total service and other revenue Total revenue Significant Judgments The Company s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment. Once the Company determines the performance obligations, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration, based on the most likely amount, to be included in the transaction price, if any. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative standalone selling price method. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed in the revenue categories above. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation in the contract (i.e. instrument, service warranty, installation) would be sold separately. As the first-year warranty for each instrument is embedded in the instrument price, the amount allocated to the first-year warranty has been determined based on the separately identifiable price of the Company s extended warranty offering when it is sold on a renewal basis. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and the expected costs and margin related to the performance obligations. Contracts in which only one performance obligation is identified (i.e., consumables and standalone software products) do not require allocation of the transaction price. Contract Assets and Liabilities The Company s contract assets consist of revenues recognized, but not yet invoiced to customers for lab services, companion diagnostic development, and instruments. The Company classifies contract assets in accounts receivable. Contract assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on timing of when the Company expects to invoice the customer. The Company recorded and in contract assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s contract liabilities consist of upfront payments for service-based warranties on instrument sales, as well as lab services. The Company classifies contract liabilities associated with service based warranties in deferred revenue, and contract liabilities associated with lab services in accrued expenses. Contract liabilities are classified as

 . Capitalizable costs to obtain contracts, such as commissions, and costs to fulfill customer contracts were determined to be immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. . The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yields of the common stock. The expected term was determined according to the simplified method, which is the average of the vesting tranche dates and the contractual term. Due to the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility, the Company bases its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded, in combination with the Company s historical volatility. For these analyses, companies with comparable characteristics are selected, including enterprise value and position within the industry, and with historical price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the Company s and the selected companies shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of its stock-based awards. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding volatility of its own stock price becomes available. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining maturities similar to the expected term of the options. The Company has not paid, and does not anticipate paying, cash dividends on shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be . For restricted stock units RSUs issued under the Company s stock-based compensation plans, the fair value of each grant is calculated based on the Company s stock price on the date of grant. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur; any compensation cost previously recognized for an award that is forfeited because of a failure to satisfy a service or performance condition will be reversed in the period of the forfeiture. Refer to Note 11 for further details on the Company s stock-based compensation plans.

December 31, 2023 Gross Gross Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Cash equivalents Total cash equivalents The Company held four debt securities at September 30, 2024 classified as marketable securities with original maturity dates greater than three months that were in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months. The fair market value of these securities was . The Company evaluated its securities for other-than-temporary impairments based on quantitative and qualitative factors. The Company considered the decline in market value for these securities to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions. It is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities, and the Company does not intend to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. Based on its analysis, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2024. The Company had no material realized gains or losses on its available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company s recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs relate to the Company s contingent consideration liability. In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments the Company expects to make as of the acquisition date. The Company re-measures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through changes in fair value of contingent consideration on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 5, 2024. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as referred to in the section titled Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A below. Please also see the section titled Special note regarding forward looking statements. Overview We are an innovative life sciences technology company delivering spatial biology solutions focused on transforming discovery, clinical research and diagnostics. Our mission is to bring context to the world of biology and human health through the power of spatial phenotyping. Spatial phenotyping refers to a rapidly evolving technology that enables academic and biopharma scientists to detect and map the distribution of cell types and biomarkers across whole tissue samples at single-cell resolution, enabling advancements in their understanding of disease progression and patient response to therapy. Through our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms, reagents, software and services, we offer end-to-end solutions to perform tissue analysis and spatial phenotyping across the full continuum from discovery through translational and clinical research and diagnostics. Our spatial biology solutions measure cells and proteins by providing biomarker data in its spatial context while preserving tissue integrity. Biomarkers are objective measures that capture what is happening in a cell or tissue at a given moment. Current genomic and proteomic methods, such as next-generation sequencing NGS ), single-cell analysis, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, are providing meaningful data but require the destruction of the tissue sample for analysis. While valuable and broadly adopted, these approaches allow scientists to analyze the biomarkers and cells that comprise the tissue but do not provide the fundamental information about tissue structure, cellular interactions and the localized measurements of key biomarkers. Furthermore, current non-destructive tissue analysis and histological methods provide some limited spatial information, but they only measure a minimal number of biomarkers at a time and require expert pathologist interpretation. Our platforms address these limitations by providing end-to-end solutions that enable researchers to quantitatively interrogate a large number of biomarkers and cell types across a tissue section at single-cell resolution. The result is a detailed and computable map of the tissue sample that thoroughly captures the underlying tissue dynamics and interactions between key cell types and biomarkers, a process now referred to as spatial phenotyping. We believe that we are the only business with the breadth of platform capabilities that enable

 researchers to do a deep exploratory and discovery study, and then further advance and scale their research through the translational and clinical phases, leading to a better understanding of human biology, disease progression and response to therapy. We also believe that we are the only spatial biology business that is capable of delivering a menu of clinical in vitro diagnostics IVD tests on our platform for routine diagnostic testing. We offer complete end-to-end solutions for spatial phenotyping, designed to serve the unique needs of our customers in the discovery, translational and clinical markets. The PhenoCycler is an ultra-high parameter and cost-effective platform ideally suited for discovery high-plex research. The PhenoImager platforms, which includes the Fusion instrument and HT instrument, provide high-throughput scalable solutions with the automation and robustness needed for translational and clinical applications. Furthermore, the PhenoCycler and the PhenoImager Fusion can be integrated into a combined system, the PhenoCycler-Fusion, to enable spatial discovery at scale by providing significant improvements in the speed of the workflow. Our portfolio of products offer seamless and integrated workflow solutions for our customers, including important benefits such as flexible sample types, automated sample processing, scalability, comprehensive data analysis and software solutions and dedicated field and applications support. With these platforms, our customers are performing spatial phenotyping to further advance their understanding of diseases such as cancer, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and many other therapeutic areas. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from North America accounted for approximately 56 and 65 of our revenue, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue from North America accounted for approximately 58 and 60 of our revenue, respectively. We generally outsource our production manufacturing and distribution of our instruments and some of our reagents. Design work and prototyping are performed in-house before pilot manufacturing and production are outsourced to third-party contract manufacturers. We use one contract manufacturer to produce our PhenoImager and PhenoCycler instruments, and a second to produce some of our reagent kits. Additionally, we have made investments in our infrastructure and manufacturing facilities to support strategic in-house manufacturing as it relates to our critical and high-complexity proprietary reagents. The contract manufacturers of our systems and reagent kits are located in the United States and Asia. Certain of our suppliers of components and materials are single source suppliers. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our equity securities, borrowings under our long-term debt agreement, and revenue from our commercial operations. We have incurred net losses in each period since our inception in 2015. Our net losses were 10.5 million and 12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net losses were 47.2 million and 52.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. However, we plan to continue to grow our business while improving results of operations in an effort to achieve cash flow positivity, as we: attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including in connection with our investments in our infrastructure to support in-house manufacturing; market and sell new and existing solutions and services; invest in processes and infrastructure to scale our business; support research and development to introduce new solutions; expand, protect and defend our intellectual property; and acquire complementary businesses or technologies to support the growth of our business.

 Key factors affecting our results of operations and future performance There are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our business, results of operations and growth. Our ability to successfully address these factors is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading Risk Factors. Our ability to expand our installed base We are focused on increasing sales of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms (Fusion and HT) to new and existing customers. Our financial performance has historically been driven by, and will continue to be impacted by, the volume of instrument sales. Additionally, instrument sales are a leading indicator of future recurring revenue from consumables and services. Our operating results and growth prospects will be dependent in part on our ability to increase our instrument installed base as we further penetrate existing markets and expand into, or offer new features and solutions that appeal to, new markets. We believe our market is still evolving and relatively underpenetrated. As spatial biology is further validated through rapid acceleration of peer-reviewed publications and growing adoption by the life sciences research market, we believe we have an opportunity to significantly increase our installed base. We regularly solicit feedback from our customers in order to enhance our solutions and their applications for life sciences research, which we believe will drive increased adoption of our platforms as they better serve our customers needs. Our ability to drive incremental pull through We believe that expansion of our installed base to new and existing customers will drive an increase in our recurring reagent and instrument service revenue. In addition, as our research and development team identifies and launches new applications and biomarker targets, we expect to increase incremental pull through on our existing and new instrument installed base. Recurring revenue was 48 and 33 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Recurring revenue was 48 and 35 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our recurring revenue as a percentage of total product and service revenue will vary based upon new device placements in the period. As our installed base expands, we expect recurring revenue on an absolute basis to increase and become an increasingly important contributor to our revenue. Our ability to improve revenue mix and gross margin Our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our platforms, consumables, software, and services. Our revenue mix will fluctuate from period-to-period, particularly revenue generated from instrument sales. As our installed base grows, we expect consumables and instrument service revenue to constitute a larger percentage of total revenue. Our margins are higher for those instruments and consumables that we sell directly to customers compared to those sold through distributors. Future instrument and consumable selling prices and gross margins may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the introduction by others of competing products and solutions. We aim to mitigate downward pressure on our average selling prices by increasing the value proposition offered by our instruments and consumables, primarily by expanding the applications for our devices, optimizing the performance of our products, introducing feature enhancements and increasing the quantity and quality of data that can be obtained using our consumables. Key Business Metrics We regularly review the number of instrument placements and cumulative instrument placement as key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, develop financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics are representative of our current business; however, we anticipate these will change or may be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business grows.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our instrument placements were as follows: 

Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Instrument Placements: 35 69 116 198 Our instruments are sold globally to leading biopharma companies and top research institutions and medical centers. Our quarterly instrument placements fluctuate from period-to-period due to the type and size of our customers and their procurement and budgeting cycles. We expect continued fluctuations in our quarterly period-to-period number of instrument placements. We believe our instrument placements is an important metric to measure our business because the number of new placements is driven by our ability to secure new customers and to increase adoption of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and because it provides insights into anticipated recurring revenue for consumables and instrument services. Components of results of operations Revenue Product Revenue We generate product revenue from the sale of our instruments, consumables and software products. Instrument sales accounted for 47 and 67 of product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Instrument sales accounted for 47 and 65 of product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Consumables revenue accounted for 51 and 32 of our product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Consumables revenue accounted for 51 and 34 of our product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our current instrument offerings include our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms. Our sales process with customers is often long and involves multiple levels of approvals. As a result, the revenue for our platforms can vary significantly from period-to-period and has been, and may continue to be, concentrated in a small number of customers in any given period. We sell our instruments directly to customers and through distributors. Each of our instrument sales drives various streams of recurring revenue comprised of consumable product sales and instrument services. Service and Other Revenue We primarily generate service and other revenue from instrument service, which generally consists of sales of extended service contracts, in addition to installation and training, as well as from our laboratory services operations, where we provide sample testing services to customers utilizing our in-house lab operation, and revenue generated from companion diagnostic development. We offer our customers extended warranty and service plans for our platforms. Our extended warranty and service plans are offered for periods beyond the standard one-year warranty that all customers receive. These extended warranty and service plans generally have fixed fees and terms ranging from one to four additional years. We recognize revenue from the sale of extended warranty and service plans over the respective coverage period, which approximates the service effort provided by us. We record shipping and handling billed to customers as service and other revenue and the related costs in cost of service and other revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.

Table of Contents 
 We sell our products globally. We sell directly to end customers in North America and we sell through third party distributors and dealers in the APAC region. We sell both directly and through third party distributors in EMEA. Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Product cost of revenue primarily consists of costs for finished goods (both instruments and reagents) produced by our contract manufacturers or in-house, and associated freight, shipping and handling costs for products shipped to customers, salaries and other personnel costs, and other direct costs related to those sales recognized as product revenue in the period. Cost of goods sold for services and other revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel costs, travel related to services provided, costs of servicing equipment at customer sites, and all personnel and related costs for our laboratory services operation. We expect that our cost of goods sold will increase or decrease to the extent that our revenue increases and decreases and depending on the mix of revenue in any specific period. Gross profit is calculated as revenue less cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross profit in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions that may impact our pricing, sales mix among instruments, sales mix changes among consumables, excess and obsolete inventories, costs we pay our contract manufacturers for their services, our cost structure for lab service operations relative to volume, product warranty obligations, and inflationary cost pressures. Our gross profit in future periods will also vary based upon our channel mix and may decrease based upon our distribution channels. Gross profit was 11.7 million compared to 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross profit was 33.5 million compared to 39.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating expenses Research and development. Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries, benefits, engineering/design costs, laboratory supplies, materials expenses for employees and third parties engaged in research and product development, and depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangibles. We expense all research and development costs in the period in which they are incurred. We plan to continue to invest in our research and development efforts to enhance existing products and develop new products. We expect these expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. Selling, general and administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for employees in our executive, accounting and finance, sales and marketing, operations, legal and human resource functions, professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, legal expenses related to intellectual property, general corporate costs, commercial sales functions, marketing, travel expenses, facilities, and IT, as well as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangibles. We expect these expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. Change in fair value of contingent consideration. On September 28, 2018, we acquired substantially all the assets of the QPS division of PKI (subsequently known as Revvity). As part of the acquisition, on September 28, 2018, we entered into a License Agreement with PKI. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we agreed to pay PKI certain royalties as a percentage of future net sales of products and services that are covered by patent rights under the agreement, in exchange for a perpetual license of the right to produce and sell QPS products. As of the acquisition date, we accounted for the future potential royalty payments as contingent consideration. This contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement. Impairment. Impairment expense primarily consists of charges recorded as a result of exiting the Menlo Park, California facilities. As a result of exiting the facilities, we performed an impairment assessment of our long-lived assets, including operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A portion of our operating lease right-of-use

Three months ended September 30, Change in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Amount Product revenue 12,298 18,048 (5,750) (32) Service and other revenue 6,516 7,167 (651) (9) Total revenue 18,814 25,215 (6,401) (25) Product revenue decreased by 5.8 million, or 32 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 6.3 million decrease in instrument revenue resulting from 35 new system placements during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 69 new system placements for the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by a 0.6 million increase in consumable revenue resulting from a larger installed base of 1,299 systems as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,132 systems as of September 30, 2023. Service and other revenue decreased by 0.7 million, or 9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease relating to lab

 services revenue, partially offset by increases in revenue generated from companion diagnostic development, and other immaterial changes. Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit and Gross Margin 

Three months ended September 30, Change in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Amount Cost of product revenue 4,430 6,208 (1,778) (29) Cost of service and other revenue 2,660 3,731 (1,071) (29) Total cost of goods sold 7,090 9,939 (2,849) (29) Gross profit 11,724 15,276 (3,552) (23) Gross margin 62 61 Cost of product revenue decreased by 1.8 million, or 29 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of product revenue was primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with decreased instrument sales during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with increased reagents sales. Cost of service and other revenue decreased by 1.1 million, or 29 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of service and other revenue was primarily driven by the workforce reductions that we executed in January and July of 2024. Gross profit decreased by 3.6 million, or 23 , and gross margin increased by 1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to decreased instrument sales during the third quarter of 2024, offset by increased reagents sales during the third quarter of 2024. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a higher mix of consumables driven by a higher installed base as well as decreased instrument sales in the current quarter.

Cost of service and other revenue decreased by 1.5 million, or 14 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of service and other revenue was primarily driven by the workforce reductions that we executed in January and July of 2024. Gross profit decreased by 6.2 million, or 16 , and gross margin decreased by 1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in instrument sales, offset by increased reagents sales. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a 2.0 million charge related to obsolete inventory associated with the Mantra 2 Quantitative Pathology Workstation and the Vectra 3 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System, a legacy product line which was discontinued in the first quarter of 2024, offset by the 2.0 million charge in the second quarter of 2023 for expired inventory and inventory expected to expire, as well as other immaterial changes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 39.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Since our inception, we have experienced losses and negative cash flows from operations, and we incurred a consolidated net loss of 47.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had an accumulated deficit of 277.2 million as of September 30, 2024. We have historically relied on equity financings and borrowings under our credit facility to fund our operations to date. We may in the future sell shares of our common stock, including pursuant 

 39 

Table of Contents 
 to the Equity Distribution Agreement to help fund our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in the foreseeable future. However, we plan to focus on improving results of operations in an effort to achieve cash flow positivity. There can be no assurance that additional financings will be available to us or that we will become profitable. Our Midcap Trust Term Loan is subject to certain financial covenants. Based on our current operating plan, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain compliance with these financial covenants for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financials. We intend to seek a waiver, refinance the outstanding borrowings or otherwise mitigate these concerns with Midcap Financial Trust or another lender. However, we can provide no assurance that a waiver will be granted, or that we will be able to refinance the amounts outstanding and in such an event, the lender may exercise any and all of its rights and remedies provided for under the Midcap Trust Term Loan. As a result of these uncertainties, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months following the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our ability to successfully commercialize and launch products, and to achieve a level of sales adequate to support our cost structure. If we are unable to execute on our business plan and adequately fund operations, or if the business plan requires a level of spending in excess of cash resources, we will have to seek additional equity or debt financing. If additional financings are required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Sources of Liquidity Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our equity securities, borrowings under long-term debt agreements, and revenue from our commercial operations. In April 2021, we raised 138.6 million in net proceeds through the sale of common stock from our IPO, after deducting the underwriter discounts and commissions and offering expenses of 12.8 million. As described further in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in June 2023, we completed a follow-on public offering of our common stock pursuant to which we raised approximately 47.8 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Midcap Trust Term Loan In October 2020, we entered into the Midcap Trust Term Loan for a 37.5 million credit facility, consisting of a senior, secured term loan. We received 32.5 million in aggregate proceeds as a result of the debt financing. On March 21, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which amended certain provisions to permit certain additional debt and capital leases. On June 1, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2, which permitted the draw of a second and third tranche of 10.0 million each, which were drawn on June 1, 2022, and September 30, 2022, respectively. Amendment No. 2 also delayed the amortization start dates for the outstanding loan amounts from November 1, 2023 until April 1, 2025, at which point we would be required to repay the principal amounts in seven equal monthly installments until the maturity date. Finally, Amendment No. 2 amended the interest rate payable on the term loan to apply an interest rate equal to the SOFR rate (with a floor of 1.61448 plus 6.35 . On November 7, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which permitted the draw of two additional tranches, each totaling 11,250, which were drawn on November 7, 2022, and December 22, 2023, respectively. Amendment No. 3 also delayed the amortization start dates for the outstanding loan amounts from April 1, 2025 until December 1, 2025 (subject to further extension upon certain conditions), at which point we would be required to repay the principal amounts in equal monthly installments until the new maturity date of November 1, 2027. In addition, Amendment No. 3 amended the interest rate payable on the term loan to apply an interest rate equal to the SOFR rate (with a floor of 2.50 plus 6.80 , and reset the call protection to begin as of November 7, 2025. Finally, Amendment No. 3 provided for a commitment fee of 74 that was paid on November 7, 2022 on the new tranche 

 40 

Table of Contents 
 amounts and an exit fee of 4.75 . Substantially all other terms and conditions, and covenants of the credit agreement remained unchanged. In July 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which amended certain affirmative financial covenants. In November 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, effective as of September 30, 2024, which amended certain affirmative financial covenants. Amendment No. 5 also extends the interest only period from December 1, 2025 until March 1, 2026 (subject to further extension upon certain conditions), at which point we must repay the principal amounts in equal monthly installments until the maturity date of November 1, 2027. Finally, Amendment No. 5 increases the exit fee from 4.75 to 6.25 . The Midcap Trust Term Loan is collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The agreement contains customary negative covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets and merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity. The agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants, including requirements to, among other things, deliver audited financial statements. If we default under the Midcap Trust Term Loan and if the default is not cured or waived, the lender could cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately. Under certain circumstances, the lender could also exercise its rights with respect to the collateral securing such loans. Moreover, any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Midcap Trust Term Loan, as amended through Amendment No. 5, as of September 30, 2024. At-the-Market Offering On November 7, 2022, we entered into the Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler with respect to an ATM offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million through Piper Sandler as our sales agent. As of September 30, 2024, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the ATM program. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Critical accounting policies and estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. Recent accounting pronouncements For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. JOBS Act accounting election We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period, and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Smaller reporting company status We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter and our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. For example, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for this reporting period and are not required to provide the information required under this item . Item 4. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. There was not any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the risks and uncertainties that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part I, Item 1A under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. The risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this report and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and related notes in this report. The occurrence of any single risk or any combination of risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, product pipeline, operating results, financial condition or liquidity, and consequently, the value of our securities. Further, additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. We have limited capital resources and will likely need additional funding before we are able to achieve profitability which raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not continue as a going concern, investors could lose their entire investment. Our recurring operating losses, in addition to our accumulated deficit, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our becoming profitable in the future or to obtain the necessary capital to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities when they become due. If we are unable to execute on our business plan and adequately fund operations, or if the business plan requires a level of spending in excess of cash resources, we will have to seek additional equity or debt financing. If additional financings are required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our determination of substantial doubt as going concern could materially limit our ability to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or otherwise. There can be no assurance that we will ever become profitable or continue as a going concern. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Not applicable. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information During the third quarter of 2024, no directors or officers or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).
