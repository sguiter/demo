CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify
forward-looking statements by terms such as may, will, should, expect, plan, 
 anticipate, could, intend, target, project, estimate, 
 believe, estimate, predict, potential or continue or the negative
of these terms or other similar expressions intended to identify statements about the future. These statements speak only as of the date
of filing this report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about the following: 

our ability to maintain
 compliance with the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq); 

our lack of operating history
 and need for additional capital; 

our plans to develop and
 commercialize our product candidates; 

the timing of our planned
 clinical trials for CTx-1301, CTx-1302, and CTx-2103; 

the timing of our New Drug
 Application (NDA) submissions for CTx-1301, CTx-1302, and CTx-2103; 

the timing of and our ability
 to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for CTx-1301, CTx-1302, CTx-2103, or any other future product candidate; 

the clinical utility of
 our product candidates; 

our commercialization,
 marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy; 

our ability to identify
 strategic partnerships; 

our
 expected use of cash; 

our competitive position
 and projections relating to our competitors or our industry; 

our
 ability to identify, recruit, and retain key personnel; 

the impact of laws and
 regulations; 

our expectations regarding
 the time during which we will be an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act); 

our plans to identify additional product candidates
 with significant commercial potential that are consistent with our commercial objectives; and 

our estimates regarding
 future revenue and expenses. 

Because
forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some
of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events
and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. You should refer to the Risk Factors section in this report and
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, for a discussion
of important factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.
We operate in an evolving environment and new risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time. It is not possible for management
to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements
in this report will prove to be accurate. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. You should
review the factors and risks and other information we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC.

million. However, the Company will need additional funding for operations and development. Management is evaluating various strategies
to obtain additional funding, which may include additional offerings of equity, issuance of debt, or other capital sources, including
potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. Successful implementation of these plans involves both
the Company s efforts and factors that are outside its control, such as market factors and FDA approval of product candidates.
The Company can give no assurance that its plans will be effectively implemented in such a way that they will sufficiently alleviate
or mitigate the conditions and events noted above, which results in substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The modified warrants were classified as equity instruments before and after
the modification, and the modification is directly attributable to an equity offering. The Company recognized the effect of modification
of approximately million as an equity issuance cost and accounting effect of the inducement is recognized in the Statement of Stockholders 
Equity. The Company received net proceeds of million on the closing of the June 2024 Warrant Inducement, which occurred on July

The
Company s stock options issued qualify for equity accounting treatment under ASC 718, Compensation- Stock Compensation, 
and are measured at fair value as of their grant date accordingly. The fair value of the options were estimated using a Black-Scholes
model. The assumptions that the Company used to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options granted to employees during the nine-month
period ending September 30, 2024 were as follows, shown on a weighted average basis: 

Expected term (in years) 

Expected volatility 

Expected dividend yield 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate : The Company based the risk-free interest rate over the expected term of the options based on the constant maturity
of U.S. Treasury securities with similar maturities as of the date of grant. 

Expected
Term: The expected term represents the period that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the
simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting dates and the end of the contractual term.) 

Expected
Volatility : The Company uses an average historical stock price volatility of comparable public companies within the biotechnology
and pharmaceutical industry that were deemed to be representative of future stock price trends as the Company does not have sufficient
trading history for its common stock. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information
regarding volatility of its own stock price becomes available. 

Expected
Dividend Yield : The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. Therefore, the expected
dividend yield was zero. 

The
grant-date fair value of options granted during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was and the grant date fair value of
the options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ranged from to . 

The
aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair
value of the Company s common stock. The fair value per share of common stock was as of September 30, 2024, and as
of December 31, 2023, based upon the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on those dates or the last trading
date prior to those dates if those dates were not a trading date. 

shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants issued in the February 2024 Offering, the Company issued Series A warrants
to purchase up to shares of common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock. The Series A
and Series B warrants have an exercise price of per share and became exercisable on the effective date of stockholder approval
of the shares issuable pursuant to the warrants. The Series A warrants have a five -year term and the Series B warrants have a two -year
term from the initial exercise date of February 5, 2024. 

The
Company evaluated the pre-funded warrants and the Series A and B warrants for liability or equity classification in accordance with the
provisions of ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , and ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and determined
that equity treatment was appropriate. The Company valued the pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock based on
their issuance date fair value of . As of September 30, 2024, all of the pre-funded warrants had been exercised. 

In
connection with the February 2024 Offering, the Company issued placement agent warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock.
The placement agent warrants have an exercise price of per share. These warrants have a five -year term ending February 2, 2029. 

The
Series A, Series B and placement agent warrants issued in the February 2024 Offering were valued using a Black-Scholes model with a risk-free
rate of - , the respective terms of five and , and a volatility of - . The estimated volatility of the Company s
common stock at the date of measurement is based on an average historical stock price volatility of comparable public companies within
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry that were deemed to be representative of future stock price trends as the Company does
not have sufficient trading history for its common stock. The risk-free rate is based on the expected term of the warrants based on the
constant maturity of U.S. Treasury securities with similar maturities as of the date of grant. The expected term has been estimated using
the contractual term of the warrants.

Evaluating
the need for, and amount of, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis
of all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Such judgments require the Company to interpret existing tax law and
other published guidance as applied to its circumstances. As part of this assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative
evidence about its profitability and tax situation. A valuation allowance is provided if, based on available evidence, it is more likely
than not that all or some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company determined that it was more likely than not
that it would not realize its deferred tax assets, based on historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income, among
other items. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of its net deferred tax assets totaling as of September 30, 2024
and at December 31, 2023, the current year portion which was recorded as a component of income tax expense on the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss. 

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. The Companies are not subject to U.S. federal and
state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. 

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes , to evaluate uncertain tax positions. This topic prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. The Company has not identified any material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated
financial statements as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis
or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (Form 10-K) and in this report, as well as disclosures in this report and our other reports
filed with the SEC, for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described
in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 

Overview 

We
are a biopharmaceutical company using our proprietary Precision Timed Release TM (PTR TM drug delivery platform
technology to build and advance a pipeline of next-generation pharmaceutical products designed to improve the lives of patients suffering
from frequently diagnosed conditions characterized by burdensome daily dosing regimens and suboptimal treatment outcomes. With an initial
focus on the treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and anxiety, we are identifying and evaluating additional therapeutic
areas where our PTR technology may be employed to develop future product candidates. Our PTR platform incorporates a proprietary Erosion
Barrier Layer (EBL) designed to allow for the release of drug substance at specific, pre-defined time intervals, unlocking the potential
for once-daily, multi-dose tablets. We believe there remains a significant, unmet need within the current treatment paradigm for true
once-daily ADHD stimulant medications with lasting duration and a superior side effect profile to better serve the needs of patients
throughout their entire active-day. 

Since
inception in 2012, our operations have focused on developing our product candidates, organizing and staffing our company, business planning,
raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates
approved for sale and have not generated any revenue. We have funded our operations through public and private capital raised. Cumulative
capital raised from these sources, including debt financing, was approximately 106.4 million as of September 30, 2024. 

We
have incurred significant losses since our inception. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will
depend on the successful development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net losses were 3.2 million
and 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Results of Operations below
for an explanation of the fluctuations in our net losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 102.4 million. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses in the near term, as we: 

seek
 regulatory approval for CTx-1301; 

continue
 research and development activities for our existing and new product candidates, primarily for CTx-1301; 

continue
 manufacturing activities, primarily relating to CTx-1301; 

seek
 licensing partners and/or outsource commercial infrastructure to support sales and marketing for CTx-1301; and 

operate
 as a public company. 

19 

Our
ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of
one or more of our product candidates. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect
to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with
other companies or other strategic transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail
to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the
development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

2024
Reverse Stock Split 

On
August 9, 2024, we completed a one-for-twelve reverse stock split (2024 Reverse Stock Split), which reduced the number of shares of our
common stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the 2024 Reverse Stock Split. The number of shares
of our authorized common stock was not affected by the 2024 Reverse Stock Split and the par value of our common stock remained unchanged
at 0.0001 per share. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2024 Reverse Stock Split. All share and per share amounts
in this report have been adjusted to reflect the 2024 Reverse Stock Split. 

Clinical,
Manufacturing and Business Update 

CTx-1301:
 We have designed our clinical program for CTx-1301 (dexmethylphenidate), our lead investigational product candidate for the treatment
of ADHD, based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) feedback regarding our CTx-1301 clinical plan, and longstanding guidance on
the streamlined approval pathway under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 

We
initiated two CTx-1301 Phase 3 clinical studies in pediatric and adolescent patients- a fixed dose study and a dose-optimized onset
and duration study in a laboratory classroom setting in the third quarter of 2023. Based upon written communication with the FDA
that further conduct of these pediatric and adolescent studies is not required for the submission of an NDA, we closed enrollment on
both Phase 3 trials. We are performing the data consolidation and analytical activities for these trials. In addition, per FDA
guidance, we initiated a food effect study utilizing CTx-1301 s highest dosage strength, 50-mg, in September 2024 and is
expected to be completed by the end of 2024. Appropriate data will be included in the NDA, targeted for a mid-2025
submission. 

We
were issued a European patent for CTx-1301 for the treatment of ADHD on August 14, 2024. The patent application includes up to 30
European territories, including the United Kingdom. 

CTx-2103:
 We have embarked on a program to develop CTx-2103 (buspirone), for the treatment of anxiety, which is one of the most common mental
health concerns in the United States. We completed a formulation study in which the pharmacokinetics were evaluated for this trimodal
tablet providing three precisely timed doses of buspirone versus one immediate release dose. In addition, scintigraphic imaging visualized
transit of the tablets through the gastrointestinal tract to confirm both the site and onset of release, which will then be correlated
with pharmacokinetic data to establish the full release profile of the CTx-2103 formulation. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile seen
in the data, CTx-2103 achieved a triple release of buspirone. These results provided the critical information required to allow us to
request a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of our clinical and regulatory program for CTx-2103 which occurred in the
fourth quarter of 2023. We received input from the FDA regarding the regulatory pathway for CTx-2103, and the design of clinical studies
for filing of an IND. Based on this FDA feedback, we believe that we can seek and win approval of CTx-2103 under the 505(b)(2) pathway,
which typically requires less time and resources than the 505(b)(1) full NDA pathway. Additional resources will be required to complete the development of this product candidate. 

20 

CTx-1302:
 We plan to initiate the clinical plan for CTx-1302 (dextroamphetamine), our second investigational asset for the treatment of ADHD,
pending additional capital resources. 

We
continue to evaluate strategic partnerships under which we would license CTx-1301 in the United States and/or internationally. In
March 2023, we entered into a joint commercialization agreement (the Commercialization Agreement) with Indegene, Inc. (Indegene) in the United States.
We are able to utilize Indegene for commercialization services for CTx-1301, including marketing, sales, market access and
distribution, on a fee for service, at our discretion. 

Securities
Issuances 

Public
Offering 

On
February 2, 2024, we entered into agreements, including a Securities Purchase Agreement, with investors, pursuant to which we issued
114,583 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 197,917 shares of our common stock, Series
A warrants to purchase up to 312,500 shares of our common stock and Series B warrants to purchase up to 156,250 shares of our common
stock (the February 2024 Offering ). The February 2024 Offering closed on February 6, 2024. The combined purchase price
per share of common stock and accompanying Series A and Series B warrants was 24.00. The combined purchase price per prefunded warrant
and accompanying Series A and Series B warrants was 23.99, which represents the public offering price per share of common stock and
accompanying warrants less the 0.0012 per share exercise price for each prefunded warrant. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable at
any time after the date of issuance and have no expiration date. The holder of pre-funded warrants may not exercise the warrants if the
holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 4.99 (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99 of the number
of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. The Series A warrants have an exercise price
of 24.00 per share, were exercisable immediately, and will expire five years after the issuance date, and the Series B warrants have
an exercise price of 24.00 per share, were exercisable immediately, and will expire two years after the issuance date. We received gross
proceeds of approximately 7.5 million, before deducting 750,950 of placement agent s fees and other offering expenses, pursuant
to the February 2024 Offering. As of September 30, 2024, all pre-funded warrants had been exercised. Holders of Series A warrants to
purchase 177,084 shares and Series B warrants to purchase 88,500 shares gave notice of exercise in connection with the June 2024 Warrant
Inducement (as defined below) on June 28, 2024. 

Warrant
Inducement 

On
June 28, 2024, we entered into an inducement offer letter agreement (June 2024 Warrant Inducement), pursuant to which certain holders
(Holders) of certain of our existing warrants to purchase 265,625 shares of common stock issued to the Holders on February 6, 2024 (February
2024 Warrants) agreed to exercise for cash their February 2024 Warrants at a reduced exercise price of 7.02 per share. In consideration
for the exercise of the February 2024 Warrants, the Holders received new Series C common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 354,167 shares of common stock and new Series D common stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of 177,083 shares of common
stock. Such new warrants have an exercise price of 7.02 per share. We received net proceeds of 1.6 million from the closing of the
June 2024 Warrant Inducement, which occurred on July 1, 2024. 

ATM
Agreement 

We
entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (ATM Agreement) with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC (HCW), as sales agent, in
January 2023 as amended in May 2023, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through HCW, shares of our common
stock for aggregate proceeds of up to 19.7 million based on prospectus supplements filed with the SEC through the date of this
report (upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the ATM Agreement). In the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we sold 902,300 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 5.8 million,
after deducting 0.2 million of compensation to HCW and other administration fees. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we
sold 957,808 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 9.3 million, after deducting 0.3
million of compensation to HCW and other administration fees. 

21 

Equity
Line of Credit 

In
April 2023, we entered into a purchase agreement (Lincoln Park Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund LLC (Lincoln Park). Pursuant
to the Lincoln Park Agreement, Lincoln Park has agreed to purchase from us up to an aggregate of 12.0 million of common stock (upon
the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the Lincoln Park Agreement) from time to time and at our sole discretion
over the 36-month term of the Lincoln Park Agreement. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1,092,337 shares of common
stock under the Lincoln Park Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 6.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
we sold 1,181,757 shares of common stock under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 6.8 million. Subsequent
to September 30, 2024, we sold 213,522 shares of common stock under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately
 0.9 million. 

Components
of Operating Results 

Revenue 

Since
inception, we have not generated any revenue and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future.
If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or if we enter into collaboration
or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from
collaboration of license agreements. 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist of costs incurred in the discovery and development of our product candidates, and primarily include: 

expenses
 incurred under third party agreements with contract research organizations (CROs), and investigative sites, that conducted or will
 conduct our clinical trials and a portion of our pre-clinical activities; 

costs
 of raw materials, as well as manufacturing cost of our materials used in clinical trials and other development testing; 

expenses,
 including salaries and benefits of employees engaged in research and development activities; 

costs
 of manufacturing equipment, depreciation and other allocated expenses; and 

fees
 paid for contracted regulatory services as well as fees paid to regulatory authorities including the FDA for review and approval
 of our product candidates. 

We
expense research and development costs as incurred. Costs for external development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of
the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors. Payments for these activities are based
on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our consolidated
financial statements as prepaid or accrued costs. 

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase
for the foreseeable future as we continue clinical development for our product candidates, as well as adding additional PTR product candidates
to our pipeline. As products enter later stages of clinical development, they will generally have higher development costs than those
in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Historically,
our research and development costs have primarily related to the development of CTx-1301. As we advance CTx-1301, CTx-1302, and CTx-2103,
as well as identify any other potential product candidates, we will continue to allocate our direct external research and development
costs to the products. We expect to fund our research and development expenses from our current cash and cash equivalents and any future
equity or debt financings, or other capital sources. 

22 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our employees in administrative, executive and finance
functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, accounting, audit, tax and consulting services,
insurance, office, and travel expenses. 

We
expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our general and administrative headcount
to support our growing operations including the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We have experienced, and will
continue to experience, increased expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory
and tax compliance services; director and officer insurance; and investor and public relations costs. 

Interest
and other income (expense), net 

Interest
and other income (expense), net consisted of interest expense on our related party notes payable until the last of those obligations
were converted to equity in the first quarter of 2024, and interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds.
The primary objective of our investment policy is liquidity and capital preservation. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during a reporting period. Actual results could differ from estimates. 

A
discussion of these policies can be found in the Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates section
of our Form 10-K. There have been no changes in our application of critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023.

R D
expenses were 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 million or 63.6 from the three months ended
September 30, 2023. This change was primarily the result of decreased clinical activity in the three months ended September 30, 2024
as compared to the same period in 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, we incurred significant costs relating to two Phase 3 studies
for CTx-1301, the fixed dose pediatric and adolescent safety and efficacy study and the pediatric dose optimization and duration study.
Enrollment in these two studies was closed in early 2024 and we are progressing with the remaining close-out and analytical activities
required for an NDA submission. Manufacturing costs also decreased, as the activity in 2023 was more significant for the manufacture
of clinical supply for the Phase 3 studies. In 2024, manufacturing activity included the completion of registration batches of CTx-1301.
The decrease in personnel costs is the result of lower headcount and the cost containment measures, which were implemented in late 2023
in order to conserve cash, including salary reductions ranging from 5-55 for all employees. This decrease was offset by the reinstatement
of 2023 base salaries for all employees in September 2024.

Total
G A expenses were 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.5 from the three months ended September
30, 2023. This is primarily the result of an increase in legal and professional fees, offset by a decrease in personnel expenses and
insurance. The increase in legal and professional fees was due to the increased use of consultants in connection with the special shareholders
meetings, the 2024 Reverse Stock Split and capital raising activity. This increase was offset by a decrease in personnel expenses primarily
due to lower headcount and the cost containment measures, which we implemented in late 2023 in order to conserve cash, including salary
reductions ranging from 5-55 for all employees. 2023 base salaries for all employees were reinstated in September 2024. In addition,
there was a decrease in the annual directors and officers insurance premium from 2023 to 2024.

R D
expenses were 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 5.4 million or 51.3 from the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. This change was primarily the result of decreased clinical activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as
compared to the same period in 2023. During the first nine months of 2023, we incurred significant costs relating to two Phase 3 studies
for CTx-1301, the fixed dose pediatric and adolescent safety and efficacy study and the pediatric dose optimization and duration study.
Enrollment in these two studies was closed in early 2024 and we are progressing with the remaining close-out and analytical activities
required for an NDA submission. Manufacturing costs also decreased, as the activity in 2023 was more significant for the manufacture
of clinical supply for the Phase 3 studies. In 2024, manufacturing activity included the completion of registration batches of CTx-1301.
The decrease in personnel costs is the result of lower headcount and the cost containment measures, which were implemented in late 2023
in order to conserve cash, including salary reductions ranging from 5-55 for all employees. This decrease was offset by the reinstatement
of 2023 base salaries for all employees in September 2024.

ended September 30, 2023. This is primarily the result of a decrease in personnel expenses and insurance. The decrease in personnel expenses
is the result of lower headcount and the cost containment measures which we implemented in late 2023 in order to conserve cash, including
salary reductions ranging from 5-55 for all employees. 2023 base salaries for all employees were reinstated in September 2024. In addition,
there was a decrease in the annual directors and officers insurance premium from 2023 to 2024. The decrease was offset
by an increase in legal and professional fees due to the increased use of consultants in connection with the special shareholders meetings,
the 2024 Reverse Stock Split and capital raising activity.

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 14.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in operating activities was
primarily due to the use of funds in our operations to develop our product candidates resulting in a net loss of 9.4 million, prior
to the effects of two noncash items, stock-based compensation expense of 0.9 million and depreciation expense of 0.5 million. Changes
in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses of 5.5 million primarily due
to the payment of vendor balances in the first quarter of 2024 with the cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our
ATM Agreement in January 2024 and the issuance of equity in the February 2024 Offering. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in operating activities was
primarily due to the use of funds in our operations to develop our product candidates resulting in a net loss of 16.6 million, prior
to the effects of two noncash items, stock-based compensation expense of 0.7 million and depreciation expense of 0.4 million. Changes
in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in miscellaneous receivables of 0.2 million primarily due to collection of an
amount recoverable on an insurance claim which had been recorded as a receivable as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of prepaid expenses
and other current assets of 1.4 million primarily due to the utilization of a deposit made to our contract manufacturing organization
(CMO) for the build out of our new manufacturing suite and the utilization of deposits made to our CROs, and an increase in trade accounts
payable and accrued expenses of 1.5 million due to increased clinical and manufacturing amounts resulting from increased development
activity, an increase in interest accrued due to the WFIA Note and an increase in legal fees payable relating to legal activity
incurred primarily in connection with capital raise activities. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to the purchase of
equipment to support our research and development. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was related to the cash proceeds from the issuance
of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement, the Lincoln Park Agreement, the February 2024 Offering and the June 2024 Warrant Inducement. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to gross proceeds of approximately
 4.0 million from the capital raise in September 2023, gross proceeds of approximately 1.0 million from the WFIA Private Placement and
proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the Lincoln Park Agreement and the ATM Agreement. In addition, we received
 3.0 million from the 2023 WFIA Debt Financing . 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

Since
our inception in 2012 through September 30, 2024, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and
negative cash flow from our operations. 

In
February 2024, we received gross proceeds of approximately 7.5 million, before deducting 750,950 of placement agent s fees and
other offering expenses in the February 2024 Offering. 

On
July 1, 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately 1.6 million from the closing of the June 2024 Warrant Inducement. 

In
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 902,300 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately
 5.8 million, after deducting 0.2 million of compensation to HCW and other administration fees. In the nine months ended September 30,
2024, we sold 957,808 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 9.3 million, after deducting
 0.3 million of compensation to HCW and other administration fees. 

27 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1,092,337 shares of common stock under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, for net
proceeds of 6,081,814. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 1,181,757 shares of common stock under the Lincoln Park
Purchase Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 6.8 million . Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold 213,522 shares of
common stock under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, for net proceeds of approximately 0.9 million. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10 million. We believe our cash will satisfy our capital needs into the
third quarter of 2025 under our current business plan. We are targeting to file our NDA submission for CTx-1301 in mid-2025. We will
need additional capital to advance our other programs and commercialization efforts. While we aware of the clinical and
manufacturing requirements and estimated costs for an NDA submission of CTx-1301, it is difficult to predict spending for additional
product candidates prior to obtaining FDA approval. Moreover, changing circumstances may cause us to expend cash significantly
faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our
control. Our policy is to invest any cash in excess of our immediate requirements in investments designed to preserve the principal
balance and provide liquidity while producing a modest return on investment. Accordingly, our cash equivalents are invested
primarily in money market funds which are currently providing only a minimal return given the current interest rate
environment. 

We
expect to continue to incur losses from operations for at least the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates,
primarily CTx-1301 and seek marketing approval and, subject to obtaining such approval, the eventual commercialization of our product
candidates. If we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we will incur significant sales, marketing and outsourced manufacturing
expenses. In addition, we expect to incur additional expenses to add operational, financial and information systems and personnel, including
personnel to support our planned product commercialization efforts. We also expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate
governance, internal controls and similar requirements applicable to us as a public company. 

Our
future use of operating cash and capital requirements will depend on many forward-looking factors, including the following: 

the
 cost and timing of manufacturing the clinical supply of our product candidates; 

the
 initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the
 clinical development plans we establish for each product candidate; 

the
 number and characteristics of product candidates that we develop or may in-license; 

the
 terms of any collaboration or license agreements we may choose to execute; 

the
 outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; 

the
 cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the
 cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us; 

the
 cost and timing of the implementation of commercial scale manufacturing activities; and 

the
 cost and timing of outsourcing our commercialization efforts, including, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product
 candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products. 

28 

To
continue to grow our business over the longer term, we plan to commit substantial resources to research and development, including clinical
trials of our product candidates, and other operations and potential product acquisitions and in-licensing. We have evaluated and expect
to continue to evaluate a wide array of strategic transactions as part of our plan to acquire or in-license and develop additional products
and product candidates to augment our internal development pipeline. Strategic transaction opportunities that we may pursue could materially
affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur additional indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. In addition,
we may pursue development, acquisition or in-licensing of approved or development products in new or existing therapeutic areas or continue
the expansion of our existing operations. Accordingly, we expect to continue to opportunistically seek access to additional capital to
license or acquire additional products, product candidates or companies to expand our operations, or for general corporate purposes.
Strategic transactions may require us to raise additional capital through one or more public or private debt or equity financings or
could be structured as a collaboration or licensing arrangement. We are actively seeking a strategic pharmaceutical partnership under
which we would license CTx-1301 in the United States, internationally, or both. In March 2023, we entered into a Joint Commercialization
Agreement with Indegene. Should we be unable to identify an appropriate pharmaceutical partnership, if we receive FDA approval for CTx-1301,
Indegene would provide commercialization services for CTx-1301, including marketing, sales, market access and distribution, on a fee
for service basis. 

If
we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would
result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to
take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional
equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our existing stockholders.
If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable
rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements
as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of our product
candidates. 

Contractual
Obligations 

The
following summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 that will affect our future liquidity. 

We
entered into a patent and know-how licensing agreement with BDD Pharma Limited in August 2018. See Item 1. Business Material
Agreements section of our Form 10-K for a description of this agreement. We are required to pay BDD Pharma certain amounts in
connection with clinical trial and regulatory milestones. The first milestone payment of 250,000 was paid in February 2023 upon dosing
of the first patient in the Phase 3 adult onset and duration study for CTx-1301. Additional payments will become due upon completion
of certain milestones as defined in the agreement. 

We
entered into agreements with vendors to complete the data consolidation and analysis for the two CTx-1301 Phase 3 clinical studies in
pediatric and adolescent patients for which we closed enrollment in early 2024 based on FDA guidance regarding our clinical program. Total
estimated cost of these agreements is 1.8 million. 

We
entered into an agreement with a CRO on August 22, 2024 to complete the final required study for CTx-1301, a fast fed study
utilizing our highest dosage strength, 50mg. Total estimated cost of this agreement is 1.5 million. 

29 

Going
Concern 

Since
inception we have been engaged in organizational activities, including raising capital and research and development activities. We have
not generated revenues and have not yet achieved profitable operations, nor have we ever generated positive cash flow from operations.
There is no assurance that profitable operations, if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. We are subject to those risks
associated with any pre-clinical stage pharmaceutical company that has substantial expenditures for research and development. There can
be no assurance that our research and development projects will be successful, that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory
approval, or that any approved product will be commercially viable. In addition, we operate in an environment of rapid technological
change that is largely dependent on the services of our employees and consultants. Further, our future operations are dependent on the
success of our efforts to raise additional capital. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern for one year after the issuance date of our financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the
possible inability of the company to continue as a going concern, which contemplates the continuation of operations, realization of assets
and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We have incurred a net loss for the three months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 and had accumulated losses of 102.4 million since inception to September 30, 2024. We anticipate incurring additional
losses until such time, if ever, that we can generate significant revenue from our product candidates currently in development. Our sources
of capital have included private capital raises in various classes of units of CTx prior to the Reorganization Merger, the issuance of
equity securities in connection with our initial public offering (IPO), public offerings, including the February 2024 Offering, sales
of common stock under our ATM Agreement and Lincoln Park Agreement, a private placement with WFIA, the WFIA Note which was
subsequently converted to equity, and the June 2024 Warrant Inducement. Additional capital will be needed by us to fund our operations,
to complete development of and to commercially develop our product candidates. There is no assurance that such capital will be available
when needed or on acceptable terms. 

JOBS
Act 

On
April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act) was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that,
among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company. As an emerging growth
company, we are electing to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of
new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on
which adoption of such standards is required for emerging growth companies. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we are not required to, among other things,
(i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404,
(ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the
audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items
such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer s compensation
to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO or until we no
longer meet the requirements for being an emerging growth company, whichever occurs first.

Evaluation
of Our Disclosure Controls 

We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after
evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

See
Part I, Item 1, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6 Contingencies, of this report. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Our
business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully
consider the risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K, together with the information contained elsewhere in this report, including
Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements and Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and in our other SEC filings in evaluating our business. These risks and uncertainties could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects for growth, and the value of an investment
in our securities. 

Except
as set forth below, there were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Form 10-K. 

Our
failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our securities from
Nasdaq, and the price of our common stock and/or warrants and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. 

Our
common stock and warrants are currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We must satisfy the continued listing requirements
of Nasdaq to maintain the listing of our securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On
May 16, 2023, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff (Staff) of Nasdaq stating that we no longer complied with the
minimum stockholders equity requirement of 2.5 million under the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (Minimum Stockholders 
Equity Rule) for continued listing. We submitted a plan of compliance to Nasdaq on June 30, 2023. On July 28, 2023, Nasdaq notified us
that it had granted an extension until November 13, 2023 to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule, conditioned
upon achievement of certain milestones included in the plan of compliance previously submitted to Nasdaq, including a plan to raise additional
capital. On November 14, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that, based upon our non-compliance with the Minimum Stockholders 
Equity Rule, the Staff had determined to delist our securities from Nasdaq, subject to our request for a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings
Panel Panel). 

On
December 26, 2023, we received an additional letter from the Staff indicating that, based upon the resignation of three members of our
board of directors on December 12, 2023 and December 13, 2023, we no longer compiled with the independent director, audit committee,
compensation committee and independent director oversight of director nominations requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605.
We timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which was held on February 13, 2024. On February 22, 2024, the Panel notified us that
(i) as a result of the appointment of three independent board members on February 12, 2024, we had regained compliance with the board
composition requirements of Nasdaq set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 and (ii) it granted our request for an exception to evidence
continued compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule through May 13, 2024. On May 21, 2024, we were formally notified
that the Panel determined that we had regained compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing
Rule 5815(d)(4)(A), we will be subject to a discretionary panel monitor through May 21, 2025 (Panel Monitor). If, within that one-year
monitoring period, we fail to maintain compliance with any Nasdaq continued listing requirement, the Staff will issue a Delist Determination
Letter and we will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial
Panel is unavailable. Notwithstanding Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2), we will not be permitted to provide the Staff with a plan of compliance
with respect to any deficiency that arises during the one-year monitoring period, and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional
time for us to regain compliance with respect to any deficiency. 

31 

On
July 28, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum
bid price of 1.00 per share for continued listing on Nasdaq (Minimum Bid Price Rule). We were provided a compliance period of 180 calendar
days from the date of the notice, or until January 24, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, pursuant to Nasdaq
Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). On November 30, 2023, we effected a reverse stock split of our common stock, and on December 15, 2023, we
received notice from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. 

On
June 17, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq indicating that, based upon our non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, the Staff
had determined to delist our securities from Nasdaq unless we timely requested a hearing before the Panel. Because we are subject to
the Panel Monitor, the Staff did not grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. We timely
requested a hearing before the Panel, which was held on July 25, 2024. Our request for a hearing stayed any suspension or delisting action
by the Staff. At such hearing we requested an extension within which to evidence compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. On August
2, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that the Panel determined to grant our request for an exception through August 23,
2024 to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. Accordingly, the Panel granted our request for continued listing on Nasdaq,
subject to: 1) on or before August 9, 2024, the Company effecting a reverse stock split at a ratio of between 1-for-3 and 1-for-15; and
2) on or before August 23, 2024, the Company demonstrating compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule by evidencing a closing bid price
of 1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions. On August 9, 2024, we completed a one-for-twelve reverse
stock split in an effort to evidence compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. On September 9, 2024, we were formally notified that
the Panel determined the Company has regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule. 

In
the event that our closing bid price again falls below 1.00 per share for more than 30 consecutive business days, we will no longer
be in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, and as a result of the Panel Monitor, we would receive a Delist Determination Letter
and we would have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel
is unavailable. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule or the other Nasdaq
listing requirements. 

We
must satisfy Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule
and the Minimum Bid Price Rule, or risk delisting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If our common stock and
warrants are delisted from Nasdaq, it could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and warrants and result in a corresponding
material reduction in the price of our common stock and warrants as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with Nasdaq
and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative
financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers
and employees and fewer business development opportunities. If our common stock and warrants are delisted, it could be more difficult
to buy or sell our common stock and warrants or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our common stock and warrants could suffer
a material decline. Delisting could also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms, if at all.
