 Introduction 
 Knife River is an aggregates-led construction materials and contracting services provider in the United States. Our 1.1 billion tons of aggregate reserves provide the foundation for our vertically integrated business strategy, with approximately 37 percent of our aggregates in 2024 being used internally to support value-added downstream products (ready-mix concrete and asphalt) and contracting services (heavy-civil construction, asphalt paving, concrete construction, site development and grading services, and in some segments the manufacturing of prestressed concrete products). We are strategically focused on being the provider of choice in mid-size, high-growth markets and are committed to our plan for continued growth and to delivering for our stakeholders customers, communities, employees and stockholders by executing on our four core values: People, Safety, Quality and the Environment. 
 We supply construction materials to customers from 14 states and also provide related contracting services, which are primarily to public-sector customers for the development and servicing of highways, local roads, bridges and other public-infrastructure projects. We have broad access to high-quality aggregates in most of our markets, which forms the foundation of our vertically integrated business model. We share resources, including plants, equipment and people, across our various locations to maximize efficiency. We also transport our products by truck, rail and barge, depending on the particular market, to complete the vertical value chain. Our strategically located aggregate sites, ready-mix plants and asphalt plants, along with our fleet of ready-mix and dump trucks, enable us to better serve our customers. We believe our integrated and expansive business model is a strong competitive advantage that provides scale, efficiency and operational excellence for the benefit of customers, stockholders and the broader communities that we serve. 
 Knife River is organized into six operating segments: Pacific, Northwest, Mountain, North Central, South and Energy Services. These operating segments are used to determine the Company's reportable segments: Pacific, Northwest, Mountain, Central and Energy Services, which are based on our method of internal reporting and management of our business. Four of the reportable segments are aligned by key geographic areas due to the production of construction materials and related contracting services and one is based on product line. Each geographic segment offers a vertically integrated suite of products and services, including aggregates, ready-mix concrete, asphalt and contracting services, while the Energy Services segment, which has locations throughout our geographic footprint, produces and supplies liquid asphalt and related services, primarily for use in asphalt road construction. We also provide the details of Corporate Services, which includes accounting, legal, treasury, information technology, human resources, corporate development costs and certain corporate expenses that support our operating segments. The internal reporting of these segments is defined based on the reporting and review process used by our chief executive officer and chief operating officer. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we realigned our reportable segments to better support our operational strategies. The liquid asphalt and related services portion of the Pacific segment s businesses are now reported under the Energy Services segment. In addition, the North Central and South operating regions have been aggregated into one reportable segment, Central. We also reallocated certain amounts to the operating segments that were previously reported within Corporate Services. All periods have been recast to conform with the revised presentation. For more information on the Company's business segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On May 31, 2023, the separation of Knife River from MDU Resources Group, Inc. ("MDU Resources") and its other businesses was completed and Knife River became an independent, publicly traded company ("Separation") listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "KNF". The Separation was completed as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the Separation, MDU Resources distributed shares representing approximately 90 percent of Knife River's outstanding common stock to holders of record of MDU Resources' common stock as of the close of business on May 22, 2023 ("Distribution"). In November 2023, MDU Resources disposed of all retained shares of Knife River.

 Separation from MDU Resources 
 On May 31, 2023, MDU Resources completed the previously announced separation of Knife River through the distribution of approximately percent of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value per share, of Knife River to the stockholders of record of MDU Resources as of the close of business on May 22, 2023. MDU Resources retained approximately percent of the outstanding shares of Knife River common stock. The Distribution was structured as a pro rata distribution of one share of Knife River common stock for every four shares of MDU Resources common stock. In November 2023, MDU Resources disposed of all retained shares of Knife River common stock in an underwritten public offering. As a result of the Distribution, Knife River is now an independent public company and its common stock is listed under the symbol KNF on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 All share and earnings per share information has been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the Distribution.

 Disaggregation 
 In the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by category for each segment and includes sales of materials to both third parties and internal customers. Due to consolidation requirements, the internal sales revenues must be eliminated against the construction materials product used in downstream materials and contracting services to arrive at the external operating revenues. We believe this level of disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

 We anticipate using these investments, which consist of insurance contracts, to satisfy our obligations under our unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our executive officers and certain key management employees, and invests in these fixed-income and equity securities for the purpose of earning investment returns and capital appreciation. These investments, which totaled million, million and million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and December 31, 2023, respectively, are classified as investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net unrealized gains on these investments were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The net unrealized loss on these investments was for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the net unrealized gain on these investments was for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value, which is considered part of the cost of the plan, is classified in other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 The Company s Level 2 money market funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held at the end of the period, based on published market quotations on active markets, or using other known sources including pricing from outside sources. The estimated fair value of the Company s Level 2 insurance contracts is based on contractual cash surrender values that are determined primarily by investments in managed separate accounts of the insurer. These amounts approximate fair value. The managed separate accounts are valued based on other observable inputs or corroborated market data. 
 Though we believe the methods used to estimate fair value are consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of other methods or assumptions could result in a different estimate of fair value. 
 Nonfinancial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
 We apply the provisions of the fair value measurement standard to our nonrecurring, non-financial measurements, including long-lived asset impairments. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments

These operating segments are used to determine the of the reportable segments are aligned by key geographic areas due to the production of construction materials and related contracting services and one is based on product line. Each segment is led by a segment manager who reports to the Company s chief operating officer, who is also the Company's chief operating decision maker, along with the chief executive officer. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization ("EBITDA"). 
 Each geographic segment mines, processes and sells construction aggregates (crushed stone and sand and gravel); produces and sells asphalt; and produces and sells ready-mix concrete as well as vertically integrating its contracting services to support the aggregate-based product lines. Contracting services include heavy-civil construction, asphalt and concrete paving, and site development and grading. Although not common to all locations, the geographic segments also sell cement, merchandise and other building materials and related services . 
 Corporate Services represents the unallocated costs of certain corporate functions, such as accounting, legal, treasury, information technology, human resources and other corporate expenses that support the operating segments. We account for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. The accounting policies applicable to each segment are consistent with those used in the audited consolidated financial statements.

 Company Overview 
 Knife River is a people-first construction materials and contracting services company. We provide construction materials and contracting services to build safe roads, bridges, airport runways and other critical infrastructure needs that connect people with where they want to go and with the supplies they need. We also champion a positive workplace culture by focusing on safety, training, inclusion, compensation and work-life balance. 
 Knife River is one of the leading providers of crushed stone and sand and gravel in the United States and operates through six operating segments across 14 states: Pacific, Northwest, Mountain, North Central, South and Energy Services. These operating segments are used to determine the Company's reportable segments and are based on our method of internal reporting and management of our business, as discussed in Note 14. The Company's reportable segments are: Pacific, Northwest, Mountain, Central and Energy Services. The geographic segments primarily provide aggregates, asphalt and ready-mix concrete, as well as related contracting services such as heavy-civil construction, asphalt paving, concrete construction, site development and grading. The Energy Services segment produces and supplies liquid asphalt and related services, primarily for use in asphalt road construction. 
 As an aggregates-led construction materials and contracting services provider in the United States, our 1.1 billion tons of aggregate reserves provide the foundation for a vertically integrated business strategy, with approximately 37 percent of our aggregates in 2024 being used internally to support value-added downstream products (ready-mix concrete and asphalt) and contracting services (heavy-civil construction, laydown, asphalt paving, concrete construction, site development and grading services, bridges and in some segments the manufacturing of prestressed concrete products). Our aggregate sites and associated asphalt and ready-mix plants are primarily in strategic locations near mid-sized, high-growth markets, providing us with a transportation advantage for our materials that supports competitive pricing and increased margins. We provide our products and services to both public and private markets, with public markets tending to be more stable across economic cycles, which helps offset the cyclical nature of the private markets.

 Basis of Presentation 
 On May 31, 2023, Knife River became a stand-alone publicly traded company. Prior to the Separation, Knife River operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Centennial Energy Holdings, Inc. ("Centennial") and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of MDU Resources Group, Inc. ("MDU Resources") and not as a stand-alone company. The accompanying historical consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the periods prior to the Separation were prepared on a carve-out basis using the legal entity approach in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and were derived from the consolidated financial statements of MDU Resources as if Knife River operated on a stand-alone basis during these periods. For additional information related to the basis of presentation, see Note 2. 
 All intercompany balances and transactions between the businesses comprising Knife River have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we realigned our reportable segments to better support our operational strategies. The liquid asphalt and related services portion of the Pacific segment s businesses are now reported under the Energy Services segment. In addition, the North Central and South operating regions have been aggregated into one reportable segment, Central. We also reallocated certain amounts to the operating segments that were previously reported within Corporate Services. All periods have been recast to conform with the revised presentation. 
 
 Market Conditions and Outlook 
 Our markets remain resilient and construction activity remains generally strong. Approximately 80 percent of our contracting services revenue each year comes from public-sector projects, enhancing stability through market cycles. For more information on factors that may negatively impact Knife River's business, see the section entitled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part I of the Company's 2023 Annual Report. 
 Backlog. Knife River s contracting services backlog was as follows: 
 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 (In millions) Pacific 114.9 69.8 51.2 Northwest 168.0 227.4 196.2 Mountain 279.9 251.1 256.7 Central 192.3 183.9 158.1 755.1 732.2 662.2 
 27 

Index 

 Expected margins on backlog at September 30, 2024, were slightly higher than the expected margins on backlog at September 30, 2023. Of the 755.1 million of backlog at September 30, 2024, we expect to complete approximately 688.9 million in the 12 months following September 30, 2024. While private work has softened to some extent, we continue to see strong bidding opportunities for public work across our states. Approximately 87 percent of our backlog at September 30, 2024, relates to publicly funded projects, including street and highway construction projects, which are driven primarily by public works projects for state departments of transportation. Further, there continues to be infrastructure development, as discussed in the following section on Public Funding, which is expected to continue to provide bidding opportunities in our markets. 
 Period-over-period increases or decreases in backlog may not be indicative of future revenues, margins, net income or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization ("EBITDA"). While we believe the current backlog of work remains firm, prolonged delays in the receipt of critical supplies and materials, among other things, could result in customers seeking to delay or terminate existing or pending agreements and could reduce expected margins. See the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of the Company's 2023 Annual Report for a list of factors that can cause revenues to be realized in periods and at levels that are different from originally projected. 
 Public Funding. Funding for public projects is dependent on federal and state funding, such as appropriations to the Federal Highway Administration. States have moved forward with allocating funds from federal programs, such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA"), which is expected to provide 1.2 trillion in funding through 2026. Approximately 48 percent of IIJA formula funding has yet to be obligated to projects in our market areas. At the state level, eight of the 14 states in which we operate have introduced legislation to fund additional construction projects as of September 1, 2024. We continue to monitor the implementation and impact of these legislative items. Additionally, Department of Transportation ("DOT") budgets in the states where we operate remain strong despite coming down from the prior years' record level. 
 Profitability. Our management team continually monitors our margins and has been proactive in applying strategies to increase margins to support our long-term profitability goals and to create shareholder value. In 2023, we began implementing EDGE initiatives and established teams to deliver training, assist with targeting higher-margin bidding opportunities across the regions and pursue growth opportunities, as well as looking for ways to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. The process improvement team ("PIT crew") visited 10 of our largest locations in 2023, including quarries, asphalt plants and ready-mix plants. In 2024, the PIT crew has been expanded to extend its influence to more locations and standardize best practices. The PIT crew has visited 58 plants across 8 states through the third quarter of 2024. 
 Our management team has also continued to evaluate growth opportunities, both through organic growth and acquisitions they believe will generate shareholder value. As of November 4, 2024, we have invested 129.3 million of capital to close on six acquisitions, with a focus on aggregate reserves, ready-mix and liquid asphalt operations. The acquisitions include aggregate-specific purchases in key markets, including the assets of Frank B. Marks Son in Northern California and Rock Products Manufacturing in Central Oregon. We also added to our ready-mix operations in California's Central Valley and, on November 2, 2024, we purchased the business of Albina Asphalt. Albina has operations in Washington, Oregon and California and will expand the footprint of our high-margin liquid asphalt materials product line. 
 Knife River operates in geographically diverse and competitive markets, and strives to maximize efficiencies, including transportation costs and economies of scale, to further expand margins and profitability. Our margins can experience negative pressure from competition, as well as impacts from the variability in the cost of raw materials, such as diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas, liquid asphalt, cement and steel, with fuel and liquid asphalt costs often having the most significant impact on results. Many of these raw materials are subject to factors that are beyond our control, including global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. The Energy Services segment is particularly susceptible to variability in liquid asphalt costs, which can impact both cost of sales and revenues, for which we cannot reliably predict future pricing. Such variability and inflationary pressures may have an impact on our margins, including fixed-price contracting services contracts that are impacted by the variability of energy and material prices. We mitigate our exposure to these fluctuations by entering into various purchase commitments, as well as by generally including terms in our contracting services agreements that provide for price adjustments related to variations in raw materials costs. 
 Our operations can also be significantly impacted by both favorable and unfavorable weather conditions. Unseasonably dry or warm weather in the states where we operate can allow for a lengthened construction season or allow for an earlier start on specific projects, while unseasonably wet and/or cold weather in the states where we operate can delay the start or cause an early end to the construction season or cause temporary delays on specific projects. Either of these conditions can impact both our construction materials sales and contracting services revenues. Other variables that can impact margins include the timing of project starts or completions, pre-construction season activities including equipment repair and maintenance costs or equipment mobilization, and declines or delays in new and existing projects due to the cyclical nature of the construction industry. Accordingly, operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. 
 Workforce. As a people-first company, we continually take steps to address safety, recruitment and retention of our employees. Safety is a core value at Knife River, and we continue to advance our safety training and safety culture through engagement, interaction and cross-company participation. 
 28 

Index 

 We continue to deploy resources to attract, develop and retain qualified and diverse talent. As the United States faces shortages in the availability of individuals to fill construction careers, we have taken significant steps to showcase construction as a career of choice. We own and operate a state-of-the-art training facility, the Knife River Training Center, which is used corporate-wide to enhance the skills of both our new and existing employees through classroom education and hands-on experience. One of the most popular courses at the Knife River Training Center is the commercial driver's license training, which is helping to address an industry-wide labor shortage. The training facility also offers a variety of courses around leadership development for all Knife River employees.

 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information and reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures, see the section entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 
 Revenue includes revenue from the sale of construction materials and contracting services. Revenue for construction materials is recognized at a point in time when delivery of the products has taken place. Contracting services revenue is recognized over time using an input method based on the cost-to-cost measure of progress on a project. 
 Cost of revenue includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production process for Knife River's products and services. Cost of revenue also includes depreciation, depletion and amortization attributable to the assets used in the production process. 
 Gross profit includes revenue less cost of revenue, as defined above, and is the difference between revenue and the cost of making a product or providing a service, before deducting selling, general and administrative expenses, income taxes and interest expense. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs for estimating, bidding and corporate development, as well as costs related to segment and corporate management and administrative functions. Selling expenses can vary depending on the volume of projects in process and the number of employees assigned to estimating and bidding activities. Other general and administrative expenses include outside services; information technology; depreciation and amortization; training, travel and entertainment; office supplies; allowance for expected credit losses; gains or losses on the sale of assets; and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 Other income includes net periodic benefit costs for the Company s benefit plan expenses, other than service costs; interest income; realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments for the Company s nonqualified benefit plans; earnings or losses on joint venture arrangements; and other miscellaneous income or expenses, including income and expenses related to the transition services agreement with MDU Resources. 
 Income tax expense consists of corporate income taxes related to the net income of the Company. Income taxes are presented at the corporate services level and not at the individual segments. The effective tax rate can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations and changes to the Company's overall levels of income before income tax. 
 The discussion that follows focuses on the key financial measures the Company uses to evaluate the performance of its business, which include revenue, gross profit, gross margin, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Gross margin is calculated by dividing gross profit

 Revenue increased 14.9 million, largely driven by additional contracting services activity resulting from more public agency-related construction work . During the quarter, prices increased as a result of our pricing initiatives across all product lines, with the exception of liquid asphalt. Aggregate and ready-mix concrete prices increased in the high single digits while asphalt increased low single digits. Liquid asphalt prices were lower as a result of reduced supply input costs across our market areas. Offsetting the price increases was a decline in ready-mix concrete and aggregate volumes across all segments, while asphalt volumes decreased in only the Central and Pacific segments. These lower volumes are largely the result of EDGE-related initiatives of quality over quantity of work, the timing of projects and lower demand for private projects. 
 Gross profit and gross margin 
 Gross profit improved 3.6 million and gross margin remained unchanged. We recognized 120 basis points higher contracting services margins in the quarter from increased activity and improved bid margins as a result of disciplined project bidding and favorable project execution. Also contributing to the improvement was an increase in gross margin on the ready-mix concrete and asphalt product lines. As part of our EDGE-related initiatives, price increases outpaced higher costs while volumes declined as the segments continue to choose quality of work over quantity of work. Liquid asphalt continued to see a reduction in gross profit from reduced market pricing.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.7 million year-over-year. Our reportable segments had higher costs of 4.5 million, which was primarily increased payroll-related costs of 3.4 million, largely due to additional staffing and competitive wage increases, and higher professional services. Corporate Services had increased costs of 2.2 million for due diligence and integration costs related to corporate development, higher health care costs of 1.9 million and additional information technology costs of 1.1 million. Offsetting these costs at Corporate Services was a reduction in insurance loss reserves at our captive insurer, as well as lower one-time Separation costs of 3.6 million, primarily related to insurance costs and the transition services agreement with MDU Resources. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense decreased 1.4 million due primarily to lower average debt balances. 
 Other income 
 Other income improved 2.5 million, largely driven by increased interest income on higher average cash balances and higher returns on nonqualified benefit plan investments. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax expense increased 1.4 million, corresponding with higher income before income taxes. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased 58.3 million, largely driven by additional contracting services activity resulting from more public agency-related construction work . During the year, prices increased as a result of our pricing initiatives across all product lines, except liquid asphalt. Aggregate and ready-mix concrete prices increased in the high single digits while asphalt increased low single digits. Liquid asphalt prices were lower as a result of reduced supply input costs across our market areas. Offsetting the price increases was a decline in ready-mix concrete and aggregate volumes across most segments, while asphalt volumes decreased only in the Central segment. These lower volumes are largely the result of EDGE-related initiatives of quality over quantity of work, the timing of projects and lower demand for private projects. 
 Gross profit and gross margin 
 Gross profit improved 29.2 million and gross margin improved 80 basis points. Contracting services margins improved 240 basis points as all segments saw an increase in revenue along with improved bid margins and favorable project execution during the year. Also contributing to the improvement was higher gross margin on all product lines except liquid asphalt. As part of our EDGE-related initiatives, price increases outpaced higher costs while volumes declined as the segments continue to choose quality of work over quantity of work. Liquid asphalt continued to see a reduction in gross profit from reduced market pricing. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.3 million. Our reportable segments had higher costs of 4.8 million, which was primarily higher payroll-related costs, largely due to additional staffing and competitive wage increases, and higher professional services of 3.0 million, partially offset by higher gains on asset sales of 2.5 million. 
 Corporate Services had increased costs of 11.4 million. The increase in costs for non-Separation related expenses include higher health care costs of 4.6 million, partly due to 2023 claims being paid from the MDU Resources health and welfare trust, due diligence and integration costs related to corporate development of 2.6 million and higher information technology costs of 1.0 million, partially offset by a reduction in insurance loss reserves at our captive insurer of 2.6 million. As a result of the Separation, Corporate Services experienced higher recurring costs as a publicly traded company of 6.6 million, including payroll-related costs of 9.5 million, largely due to additional staff and stock-based compensation expenses for the management team and board of directors; information technology costs of 2.8 million; professional services of 2.0 million; fees of 870,000 primarily related to fees on new debt issued in conjunction with the Separation; and insurance costs of 600,000. These recurring costs were partially offset by a reduction in general corporate expenses from MDU Resources of 9.0 million, as discussed in Note 2. Also, as part of the Separation, we incurred less one-time costs of 2.8 million, primarily related to insurance costs and the transition services agreement with MDU Resources. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense decreased 2.2 million due primarily to lower average debt balances, offset by higher average interest rates. 
 Other income

 Business Segment Financial and Operating Data 
 A discussion of key financial data from Knife River s business segments follows. Knife River provides segment-level information by revenue, gross profit, gross margin, EBITDA and EBITDA margin, as these are the measures of profitability used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operational results. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information and reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measure, see the section entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we realigned our reportable segments to better support our operational strategies. Based on how the chief operating decision maker manages the Company, the reportable segments are: Pacific, Northwest, Mountain, Central and Energy Services. The liquid asphalt and related services portion of the Pacific segment s businesses are now reported under the Energy Services segment. In addition, the North Central and South operating regions have been aggregated into one reportable segment, Central. We also provide the details of Corporate Services, which includes accounting, legal, treasury, information technology, human resources and certain corporate expenses that support our operating segments. As a result of the segment changes, we reallocated certain amounts to the operating segments that were previously reported within Corporate Services. All periods have been recast to conform with the revised presentation.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased 7.7 million as price increases across its product lines contributed an additional 12.0 million, which was mainly due to pricing initiatives and aggregate product mix. The revenue increase was also driven by an increase in construction activity in Northern California of 11.5 million, which was largely related to additional public agency-related construction activity. Offsetting the price increases were reduced volumes of 12.9 million across all material product lines, partly due to increased competition and reduced demand in private markets. 
 Gross profit and gross margin 
 Gross profit improved 1.0 million, largely due to increased gross profit across most product lines as a result of price increases outpacing costs, providing an additional 1.2 million. Also contributing to additional gross profit was more public agency-related construction work in Northern California. These increases were offset by lower asphalt volumes due to the nature of the contracting work in the quarter being more heavy-civil construction than paving, as well as higher costs, which contributed to a decline in gross margin of 30 basis points.

 EBITDA and EBITDA margin 
 EBITDA improved 900,000 year-over-year, largely due to improved gross profit, as previously discussed. Slightly offsetting the increase was higher selling, general and administrative costs, largely payroll-related costs and professional services. EBITDA margin resulted in a decrease of 30 basis points, largely the result of the previously discussed lower gross margin. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenue 
 Revenue increased 27.1 million across all core product lines. This increase resulted from increased pricing of 26.6 million primarily from pricing initiatives and additional construction activity in Northern California of 20.8 million, which was largely related to public agency-related construction work. Partially offsetting the increased revenues were lower aggregate and ready-mix concrete volumes of 11.9 million across the segment's markets related to the timing of projects and reduced private-market demand. 
 Gross profit and gross margin 
 Gross profit improved 400,000, primarily the result of additional gross profit from contracting services of 3.2 million, largely from more public agency-related construction work in Northern California and improved project execution. Partially offsetting the increase in gross profit were lower aggregate and ready-mix concrete volumes, as previously discussed. The increase in gross profit was also offset by higher repair and maintenance costs within the aggregate, asphalt and ready-mix concrete product lines, which partially contributed to a decline in gross margin of 120 basis points. 
 EBITDA and EBITDA margin 
 EBITDA improved 400,000, largely due to improved gross profit, as previously discussed. EBITDA margin decreased 90 basis points, largely as the result of the previously discussed lower gross margin.

 Corporate Services and Eliminations 
 Corporate Services includes all expenses related to the corporate functions of the Company, as well as insurance activity at our captive insurer; interest expense on a majority of the Company's long-term debt; interest income; and unrealized gains or losses on investments for the Company's nonqualified benefit plans. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 During the third quarter of 2024, Corporate Services contributed negative EBITDA of 13.7 million, compared to negative EBITDA of 15.6 million in the prior year. EBITDA was positively impacted by higher gains on nonqualified benefit plans of 1.3 million and additional income from third-party training courses at the Knife River Training Center. Partially offsetting these benefits was a slight increase in selling, general and administrative costs consisting primarily of 2.2 million of due diligence and integration costs related to corporate development, higher health care costs of 1.9 million and additional information technology costs of 1.1 million. Offsetting these costs were less one-time Separation costs of 3.6 million, primarily related to insurance costs and the transition services agreement with MDU Resources, and a reduction in insurance loss reserves at our captive insurer. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Corporate Services contributed negative EBITDA of 42.3 million, or 10.5 million less EBITDA compared to the prior year. Corporate Services had increased selling, general and administrative costs of 11.5 million. The increase in costs for non-Separation related expenses include higher health care costs of 4.6 million, partly due to 2023 claims being paid from the MDU Resources health and welfare trust, due diligence and integration costs related to corporate development of 2.6 million and higher information technology costs of 1.0 million, partially offset by a reduction in insurance loss reserves at our captive insurer of 2.6 million. As a result of the Separation, Corporate Services experienced higher recurring costs as a publicly traded company of 6.6 million, including payroll-related costs of 9.5 million, largely due to additional staff and stock-based compensation expenses for the management team and board of directors; information technology costs of 2.8 million; professional services of 2.0 million; fees of 870,000 primarily related to fees on new debt issued in conjunction with the Separation; and insurance costs of 600,000. These recurring costs were partially offset by a reduction in general corporate expenses from MDU Resources of 9.0 million, as discussed in Note 2. Also, as part of the Separation, we incurred less one-time costs of 2.8 million, primarily related to insurance costs and the transition services agreement with MDU Resources. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 220.4 million, working capital of 733.5 million and borrowing capacity of 329.4 million on our revolving credit agreement, net of our outstanding letters of credit. Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, we have sufficient liquid assets, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to meet our financial commitments, debt obligations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. 
 Given the seasonality of our business, we typically experience significant fluctuations in working capital needs and balances throughout the year. Working capital requirements generally increase in the first half of the year as we build up inventory and focus on preparing our equipment, facilities and crews for our construction season. Working capital levels then decrease as the construction season winds down and we collect on receivables. 
 Knife River s ability to fund its cash needs will depend on the ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and obtain debt financing with competitive rates. Knife River relies on access to capital markets as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations, particularly in the first half of the year due to the seasonal nature of the business. Our principal uses of cash in the future will be to fund our operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures, repayment of debt and strategic business development transactions. 
 
 Capital expenditures 
 We are committed to a disciplined use of capital, including reinvesting in the company to maintain fixed assets, improve operations and grow our operations. We allocate capital expenditures in two categories, which align with our EDGE strategy, as follows: 
 Discipline - Support and Improve Existing Operations 
 Maintenance: Plant and equipment; aggregate reserve replacement. 
 Improvements: Productivity, safety, quality and environmental improvements that drive return on invested capital and support our core values. 
 We estimate 2024 capital expenditures for our Discipline category to be between 170 million and 200 million, with 127.2 million spent as of September 30, 2024. The majority has been spent on routine replacement of vehicles and equipment, plant improvements and buildings.

 Growth - Expand Operations 
 Organic: Greenfield growth in new markets; additional operations in existing markets. 
 Acquisition: Purchase bolt-on or new platform operations in mid-sized, high-growth markets; focused on materials. 
 As of November 4, 2024, we have invested 129.3 million in our Growth category on six acquisitions which include aggregate reserves, ready-mix and liquid asphalt operations. Within the Growth category, we have 23.1 million approved for the remainder of 2024 for the initial stages of approved greenfield projects. 
 Capital expenditures for future acquisitions and organic opportunities would be incremental to the outlined capital program; these opportunities are dependent upon economic and other competitive conditions. It is anticipated that capital expenditures for 2024 will be funded by various sources, including internally generated cash and debt.

 115.1 93.0 22.1 Changes in current assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions: Receivables (224.8) (302.5) 77.7 Due from related-party 16.1 (16.1) Inventories (27.3) 8.6 (35.9) Other current assets 11.1 (20.2) 31.3 Accounts payable 77.2 91.6 (14.4) Due to related-party (7.3) 7.3 Other current liabilities 17.3 78.0 (60.7) Pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions (2.5) (1.6) (.9) Other noncurrent charges 5.4 35.0 (29.6) Net cash provided by operating activities 149.9 152.9 (3.0) 
 Cash provided by operating activities at September 30, 2024, decreased 3.0 million, largely related to higher working capital needs. Cash used by working capital components totaled 146.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 135.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in cash usage in 2024 was the result of higher accrued compensation due in part to additional employees associated with the Separation; higher liquid asphalt and aggregate inventory balances, due in part to higher costs of aggregate inventory; timing of prepaid insurance due to the Separation; the removal of all related-party balances due to the Separation; and fluctuations in the timing of payment on accounts payable. Partially offsetting these decreases were stronger collections on receivables balances during 2024 and higher net income.

 Investing activities 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance (In millions) Capital expenditures (127.2) (86.4) (40.8) Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (15.0) (15.0) Net proceeds from sale or disposition of property and other 7.6 5.2 2.4 Investments (3.2) (1.7) (1.5) Net cash used in investing activities (137.8) (82.9) (54.9) 
 The increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, including a liquid asphalt expansion project and routine replacement of vehicles and equipment. In addition, three acquisitions were completed in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Financing activities 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Variance (In millions) Issuance of long-term related-party notes, net 205.3 (205.3) Issuance of long-term debt 700.0 (700.0) Repayment of long-term debt (5.3) (1.9) (3.4) Debt issuance costs (16.7) 16.7 Tax withholding on stock-based compensation 
 (1.7) (1.7) Net transfers to Centennial (850.6) 850.6 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (7.0) 36.1 (43.1) 
 The decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was largely related to changes in the Company's debt structure as a result of the Separation, which included the issuance of senior notes, term loans and a revolving credit facility, and a transfer of the majority of the proceeds to Centennial. 
 
 Material cash requirements 
 There were no material changes in the contractual obligations from those reported in the 2023 Annual Report other than as set forth below. For more information on our contractual obligations on long-term debt, operating leases and purchase commitments, see Part II, Item 7 in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Our material short-term and long-term cash requirements include repayment of third-party long-term debt and related interest payments, payments on operating lease agreements, payments of obligations on purchase commitments and asset retirement obligations. 
 At September 30, 2024, our purchase commitments reflected a decrease of approximately 22 percent from the balance at December 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily related to our fulfillment of part of the three-year cement contract entered into during 2023. In addition, due to the seasonality of work and the third quarter being its peak construction season, our purchase commitments saw an expected decrease from the balance at June 30, 2024. We expect purchase commitments to continue to decrease throughout the remainder of 2024 as obligations continue to be satisfied during the construction season. 
 
 Defined benefit pension plans 
 We have noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans for certain employees. Various assumptions are used in calculating the benefit expense (income) and liability (asset) related to these plans. Costs of providing these benefits are dependent upon assumptions of future conditions and bear the risk of changing. 
 There were no other material changes to our qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans from those reported in the 2023 Annual Report other than increased contributions of approximately 2.1 million made to our pension plans during the third quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by additional discretionary contributions. For more information, see Note 17 and Part II, Item 7 in the 2023 Annual Report.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Business Segment Financial and Operating Data includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, including those measures by segment, as applicable, are considered non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for the applicable GAAP metric. 
 EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are most directly comparable to the corresponding GAAP measures of net income and net income margin. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to corresponding GAAP measures, are useful to investors by providing meaningful information about operational efficiency compared to our peers by excluding the impacts of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels and capital investment. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful performance measures because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance by excluding stock-based compensation and unrealized gains and losses on benefit plan investments as they are considered non-cash and not part of our core operations. We also exclude the one-time, non-recurring costs associated with the Separation as those are not expected to continue. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA assist rating agencies and investors in comparing operating performance across operating periods on a consistent basis by excluding items management does not believe are indicative of the Company's operating performance. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important financial metrics for debt investors who utilize debt to EBITDA and debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratios. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, including those measures by segment, are useful performance measures because they provide clarity as to the operational results of the Company. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP results when evaluating our operating results internally and calculating employee incentive compensation. 
 EBITDA is calculated by adding back income taxes, interest expense (net of interest income) and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense to net income. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back unrealized gains and losses on benefit plan investments, stock-based compensation and one-time Separation costs, to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenues. These non-GAAP financial measures are calculated the same for both the segment and consolidated metrics and should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, GAAP financial measures such as net income or net income margin, and are intended to be helpful supplemental financial measures for investors understanding of our operating performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin measures having the same or similar names. 
 The following information reconciles segment and consolidated net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and provides the calculation of EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Interest expense, net, is net of interest income that is included in other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

New Accounting Standards 
 For information regarding new accounting standards, see Note 3, which is incorporated by reference. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Knife River's critical accounting estimates include revenue recognized using the cost-to-cost measure of progress for contracts; impairment testing of goodwill; and impairment testing of long-lived assets excluding goodwill. There were no material changes in the Company's critical accounting estimates from those that were previously reported in the Company's 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with interest rates and commodity prices. We have policies and procedures to assist in controlling these market risks and from time to time have utilized derivatives to manage a portion of our risk. 
 Interest rate risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 266.4 million in term loans outstanding which bear interest at a variable rate. As of September 30, 2024, the rate in effect was 6.45 percent, therefore, a hypothetical increase of 1.00 percent to the interest rate at September 30, 2024, would increase the all-in rate to 7.45 percent, the effect of which would increase the Company's interest expense by 2.7 million over the next 12 months based on the balances outstanding for these borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding interest rate hedges. 
 Commodity price risk 
 There were no material changes to commodity price risk faced by the Company from those reported in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and other procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The Company's disclosure controls and other procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial

 officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and other procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, such controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in internal controls 
 No change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

 KNIFE RIVER MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

Document 

KNIFE RIVER CORPORATION 
 MINE SAFETY INFORMATION 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires issuers to include in periodic reports filed with the SEC certain information relating to citations or orders for violations of standards under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (Mine Safety Act). The Dodd-Frank Act requires reporting of the following types of citations or orders 
 
 1. Citations issued under Section 104 of the Mine Safety Act for violations that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a coal or other mine safety or health hazard. 
 2. Orders issued under Section 104(b) of the Mine Safety Act. Orders are issued under this section when citations issued under Section 104 have not been totally abated within the time period allowed by the citation or subsequent extensions. 
 3. Citations or orders issued under Section 104(d) of the Mine Safety Act. Citations or orders are issued under this section when it has been determined that the violation is caused by an unwarrantable failure of the mine operator to comply with the standards. An unwarrantable failure occurs when the mine operator is deemed to have engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence. 
 4. Citations issued under Section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Safety Act for flagrant violations. Violations are considered flagrant for repeat or reckless failures to make reasonable efforts to eliminate a known violation of a mandatory health and safety standard that substantially and proximately caused, or reasonably could have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury. 
 5. Imminent danger orders issued under Section 107(a) of the Mine Safety Act. An imminent danger is defined as the existence of any condition or practice in a coal or other mine which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated. 
 6. Notice received under Section 104(e) of the Mine Safety Act of a pattern of violations or the potential to have such a pattern of violations that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of mine health and safety standards. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company's operating subsidiaries received citations or orders under the following sections of the Mine Safety Act 104(b), 104(d), 110(b)(2), 107(a) or 104(e). The Company did not have any mining-related fatalities during this period. 
 MSHA Identification Number Contractor ID Section 104 S&S Citations (#) Total Dollar Value of MSHA Assessments Proposed ) Total Number of Mining Related Fatalities (#) Legal Actions Pending as of Last Day of Period (#) Legal Actions Initiated During Period (#) Legal Actions Resolved During Period (#) 21-03248 147 21-03870 294 35-00634 1 35-03380 2 35-03505 147 41-03931 1 1 1 3 588 1 1 1 
 
 Legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act.
