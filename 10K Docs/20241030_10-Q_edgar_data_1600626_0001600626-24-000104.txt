When the carrying amounts of the real estate assets are not recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the Company calculates an impairment charge in the amount the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate asset as of the measurement date.

 Nonrecurring Measurement - Goodwill Impairment 
 The Company s goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment on October 1st of each year for each reporting unit, as applicable, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill is more likely than not impaired. The Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether a potential impairment of goodwill exists prior to quantitatively estimating the fair value of each relevant reporting unit. If an impairment exists, the Company recognizes an impairment of goodwill based on the excess of the reporting unit s carrying value compared to its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill for that reporting unit. 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2024, within the Other segment, the Company sold properties for million. As a result of the sales, the Company performed a quantitative assessment to estimate the fair value in the Other reporting unit. Based on the results, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Other reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. Thus, the Company recorded a million impairment of the goodwill allocated to the Other reporting unit. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, within the Other segment, (i) the Company sold properties for million and (ii) recognized impairments on properties for million. As a result of these sales and impairments, the Company performed a quantitative assessment to estimate the fair value in the Other reporting unit. Based on the results, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Other reporting unit was greater than the carrying amount. Thus, the Company recorded impairment of the goodwill allocated to the Other reporting unit. 
 The following is a summary of the quantitative fair value information used in the goodwill impairment calculation.

 to . The Company considered these inputs as Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. For the remaining assets and liabilities included within the goodwill impairment calculation, the Company determined that amounts within the consolidated financial statements approximated fair value. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s remaining goodwill balance was million, of which million was allocated to the Industrial segment and million was allocated to the Other segment. Refer to Note 14, Segment Reporting , for allocation of goodwill presented for each segment.

 Financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and consolidated debt, as defined in Note 5, Debt. With the exception of the secured debt in the table below, the amounts of the financial instruments presented in the consolidated financial statements substantially approximate their fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The fair value of the secured debt in the table below is estimated by discounting each loan s principal balance over the remaining term of the loan using current borrowing rates available to the Company for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities.

 Redemption of OP units from Self-Administration Transaction 
 In connection with the transaction that resulted in the internalization of management of Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT, Inc. (our Predecessor in December 2018 (the Self-Administration Transaction ), Griffin Capital, LLC GC LLC ), an entity controlled by our former Executive Chairman, Kevin A. Shields, and an affiliate of the sponsor of our Predecessor and Griffin Capital Company, LLC GCC LLC ), received OP units (approximately million taking into effect the to 1 reverse split) as consideration in exchange for the sale to our Predecessor of the advisory, asset management and property management business of Griffin Capital Real Estate Company, LLC (n/k/a PKST Management Company, LLC, the Management Company ). GC LLC assigned approximately of the OP units received in connection with the Self-Administration Transaction to then participants in GC LLC s long-term incentive plan. Mr. Shields is the plan administrator of such long-term incentive plan. 
 As previously disclosed, certain of our current and former employees and executive officers, including Michael Escalante, our Chief Executive Officer, and Javier Bitar, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, were employed by affiliates of GC LLC prior to the Self-Administration Transaction and are therefore participants in a GC LLC s long term incentive plan that made grants to such participants in connection with services rendered prior to the Self-Administration Transaction. Participants in GC LLC s long-term incentive plan, including Messrs. Escalante and Bitar, are entitled to receive distributions from the long-term incentive plan in the form of either cash, common shares, or other property, or a combination thereof, as elected by the plan administrator. 
 The Listing required that certain awards under GC LLC s long-term incentive plan be settled during the fourth quarter 2023 and in annual installments thereafter, unless waived or modified . 
 On December 15, 2023, GC LLC settled the first of such installments by electing to redeem OP units, and we satisfied such redemption request with our common shares. 
 If GC LLC elects to redeem additional OP units for further installments, we intend to satisfy such redemption request with our common shares. Any future redemption of OP units and distribution of common shares would have no economically dilutive effect on our common shareholders.

 reportable segments: Industrial, Office, and Other. The Industrial segment consists of high-quality, well-located industrial properties with modern specifications. The Office segment includes newer, high-quality office properties. The Other segment consists of vacant and non-core properties, together with other properties in the same cross-collateralized loan pools. 
 The Company evaluates performance of each segment based on segment net operating income NOI ), which is defined as property revenue less property expenses. The Company excludes the following from Segment NOI because they are addressed on a corporate level: (i) the Office Joint Venture, (ii) interest expense, and (iii) general and administrative expenses. Segment NOI is not a measure of operating income or cash flows from operating activities, is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Not all companies calculate segment profit measures in the same manner. The Company considers segment NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it assists both investors and management in understanding the core operations of our properties.

 Leasing Information 
 As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that the current average market rental rates for all leases in our Industrial segment that are scheduled to expire within the next four years are approximately 15 to 20 greater than the weighted average in-place cash rental rates. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that the current average market rental rates for all leases in our Office and Other segments that are scheduled to expire within the next four years are approximately 2 below to 3 greater than the weighted average in-place cash rental rates. 
 Our estimates regarding current average market rental rates are based on our internal analysis and/or third-party broker quotes, when available, and there is no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate. Market rental rates and the demand for our properties are impacted by general economic conditions, including the pace of economic growth and access to capital in the submarkets in which our properties are located. Therefore, there is no assurance that expiring leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased above, below or at current market rental rates.

 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 The Company s long-term objective is to leverage the experience of our team to maximize shareholder value through the ownership and operation of industrial and select office assets located in strategic markets. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet that enables us to execute multi-channel investments across the risk and capital spectrum. It is our intention to continue to maximize our balance sheet flexibility through, among other things, free cash flow generation and the continued execution of our strategic disposition plan. We seek to generate internal and external growth by optimizing the cash flow from our properties and expanding our portfolio by making industrial-focused investments. 
 Business Environment 
 The dynamic landscape of the capital markets has caused a shift in the sentiment of real estate investors. The interplay of economic indicators, geopolitical tensions, and monetary policy adjustments has created an environment where caution prevails. Amidst these challenges, real estate investors appear to be cautiously optimistic due to the apparent reversal of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which could alleviate the availability and cost of financing, potentially revitalizing investor confidence. 
 Industrial trends including onshoring and nearshoring of manufacturing and warehousing operations, the projected increase in U.S. industrial production, and the continued growth of e-commerce are anticipated to drive sustained demand for industrial real estate in the long run. The slowing pace of construction and increasing resistance from municipalities for new industrial development are limiting industrial supply, which we believe will benefit existing industrial assets over time. Also, while demand has moderated relative to record levels in recent years, it remains relatively steady across most markets and vacancy rates remain low by historic standards. 
 The office market continues to undergo a period of adaptation driven by evolving workplace preferences. While overall demand for office space nationwide has declined relative to pre-Covid standards, newer and more modern office buildings, with high walk-scores, immediate access to retail amenities and transportation hubs appear to continue to attract and retain tenants and achieve top-of-market rental rates. 
 For a discussion of material trends and uncertainties that have impacted or may impact the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, see (i) the discussion above, (ii) the risks highlighted in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and (iii) the risks highlighted in the Risk Factors section of the Company s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Segment Information 
 The Company internally evaluates all of the properties and interests therein as three reportable segments: Industrial, Office and Other. The Company evaluates performance of each segment based on segment net operating income NOI ), which is defined as property revenue less property expenses. The Company excludes the following from segment NOI because they are addressed on a corporate level: (i) the Office Joint Venture, (ii) interest expense, and (iii) general administrative expenses. Segment NOI is not a measure of operating income or cash flows from operating activities, is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Not all companies calculate segment profit measures in the same manner. The Company considers segment NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it assists both investors and management in understanding the core operations and valuations of our properties. 
 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Same Store NOI 
 Total net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was (26.5) million and (139.9) million, respectively.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We have established accounting estimates which conform to GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to the various transactions had been different, it is possible that different estimates would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may use different estimates and assumptions that may impact the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations to those companies. 
 There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates during the period covered by this report. For a summary of certain of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to our filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements under Item 1 of this report on Form 10-Q.

 Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 Our reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose Funds from Operations FFO and Adjusted Funds from Operations AFFO both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these two non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ). FFO is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate assets, adding back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets), and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred dividends. Because FFO calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of depreciable real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. It should be noted, however, that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do, making comparisons less meaningful. 
 Additionally, we use AFFO as a non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our operating performance. AFFO excludes non-routine and certain non-cash items such as revenues in excess of cash received, amortization of share-based compensation net, deferred rent, amortization of in-place lease valuation, acquisition or investment-related costs, financed termination fee, net of payments received, gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt, unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, write-off transaction costs and other one-time transactions. We believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry and is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies. Management believes that AFFO is a beneficial indicator of our ongoing portfolio performance and isolates the financial results of our operations. AFFO, however, is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings. Further, since the measure is based on historical financial information, AFFO for the period presented may not be indicative of future results. 
 By providing FFO and AFFO, we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management s analysis of long-term operating activities. FFO and AFFO have been revised to include amounts available to both common shareholders and limited partners for all periods presented. 
 For all of these reasons, we believe the non-GAAP measures of FFO and AFFO, in addition to net income (loss) are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio. However, a material limitation associated with FFO and AFFO is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund the payment of dividends since other uses of cash, such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt, are not deducted when calculating FFO and AFFO. The use of AFFO as a measure of long-term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan. FFO and AFFO should not be viewed as a more prominent measure of performance than net income (loss) and each should be reviewed in connection with GAAP measurements. 
 Neither the SEC, NAREIT, nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust FFO in order to calculate AFFO and its use as a non-GAAP performance measure. In the future, NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the REIT industry, and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non-GAAP measure. 
 Our calculation of FFO and AFFO is presented in the following table for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

 NOI and Cash NOI 
 Net operating income NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, excluding general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of real estate, impairment of goodwill, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, investment income or loss, termination income and equity in earnings of any unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. NOI on a cash basis Cash NOI is NOI adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease intangibles adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI and Cash NOI are helpful to investors as additional measures of operating performance because we believe they help both investors and management to understand the core operations of our properties excluding corporate and financing-related costs and non-cash depreciation and amortization. NOI and Cash NOI are unlevered operating performance metrics of our properties and allow for a useful comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. These measures thereby provide an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income from operations or net income. In addition, NOI and Cash NOI are considered by many in the real estate industry to be useful starting points for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. 
 Because NOI and Cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and Cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Therefore, NOI and Cash NOI should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), as computed in accordance with GAAP. NOI and Cash NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Our calculation of each of NOI and Cash NOI is presented in the following table for three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We believe that cash flow generated from our properties, including proceeds from dispositions, will continue to enable us to fund our normal operating expenses, regular debt service obligations, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions of, or investments in, assets, and all dividends and distribution requirements in accordance with applicable REIT requirements in both the short-term and long-term. Furthermore, we expect that cash on hand, borrowings from our Revolving Credit Facility, proceeds from mortgage financing and other debt, proceeds from the sale of properties, and issuances of equity will provide other potential sources of capital. To the extent we are not able to secure other potential sources of capital, we will be heavily dependent upon income from operations and our current financing. 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Cash Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 241.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from our properties, which we expect to be adequate to fund our liquidity needs. However, a number of factors could have an adverse impact, including decreases in occupancy levels and rental rates, the ability and willingness of our tenants to pay rent, the timing and success of our investment activities, and general financial and economic conditions. 
 Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, the Operating Partnership, as the borrower, has been provided with a 1.3 billion credit facility consisting of (i) a 547.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility ), under which the Operating Partnership has drawn 390.0 million (the Revolving Loan ), (ii) a 210.0 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in December 2028 (the 2028 Term Loan ), and (iii) a 150.0 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in April 2026 (the 2026 Term Loan and together with the Revolving Loan and the 2025 Term Loan, the KeyBank Loans ). The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides the option, subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders and certain other customary conditions, to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, to increase the existing term loans and/or incur new term loans by up to an additional 393.0 million in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, the available undrawn capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility was 157.0 million. 
 ATM Program 
 In August 2023, we entered into an at-the-market equity offering (the ATM pursuant to which we may sell common shares up to an aggregate purchase price of 200.0 million. We may sell such shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us from time to time, but we have no obligation to sell any of the shares. Actual sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, capital needs, and our determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. As of September 30, 2024, we have not sold any shares under the ATM program. 
 Other Potential Sources of Capital 
 Other potential sources of capital include proceeds from private or public offerings of our common shares or OP Units, proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, including debt assumed in a real estate transaction, and entering into joint venture arrangements to invest in assets. If necessary, we may use other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen expenditures.

 Uses of Liquidity 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024 included the following contractual obligations: 
 Debt and Ground Lease Obligations Total Payments Remaining 2024 Thereafter Outstanding debt obligations (1) 
 1,183,018 1,257 1,181,761 Interest on outstanding debt obligations (2)

 (1) Amounts only include principal payments. The payments on our mortgage debt do not include the premium/discount or debt financing costs. 
 (2) Projected interest payments are based on the outstanding principal amounts at September 30, 2024. Projected interest payments on our KeyBank Loans are based on the contractual interest rates in effect at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate remaining contractual commitment for capital expenditures, leasing commissions and tenant improvements of approximately 8.3 million. 
 Dividends and Distributions 
 Dividends will be authorized at the discretion of our Board and be paid to our shareholders and holders of OP Units as of the record date selected by our Board. We expect to pay dividends on a quarterly basis unless our results of operations, our general financial condition, general economic conditions, or other factors inhibit us from doing so. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Board declared an all-cash dividend in the amount of 0.225 per common share and an all-cash distribution in the amount of 0.225 per OP Unit. 
 Additionally, to qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements on a continuing basis, including the requirement that we annually distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain, to our shareholders. As a result of this requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our business needs to the same extent as other entities that are not REITs. If we do not have sufficient funds available to us from our operations to fund our business needs, we will need to find alternative ways to fund those needs. As of September 30, 2024, the Company satisfied the REIT requirements and distributed all of its taxable income.

 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Comparison of cash flow activity as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is as follows (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by operating activities 62,953 58,770 4,183 Net cash provided by investing activities 102,929 289,796 (186,867) Net cash used in financing activities (300,161) (216,413) (83,748) 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were 266.7 million and 370.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 respectively. 
 Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent on the occupancy level, the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, and the timing and success of our investing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 63.0 million in cash from operating activities compared to 58.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to significant decreases in transaction expenses incurred as a result of the Listing in 2023, partially offset by the impact of property dispositions. 
 Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in thousands):

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The primary market risk to which we believe we may be exposed is interest rate risk, including the risk of changes in the underlying rates on our variable rate debt, which may result from factors that are beyond our control. Our current indebtedness consists of the KeyBank Loans and other loans and property secured mortgages as described in Note 5. Debt , to our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These instruments were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. 
 We may enter into interest rate hedging instruments (collectively, Interest Rate Swaps to provide greater predictability in interest expense by protecting against potential increases in floating interest rates and allow for more precise budgeting, financial planning and forecasting. We will not enter into these instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, such as counterparty credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts. 
 Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate debt. A change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts its fair value but has no effect on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on variable rate debt could affect the interest incurred and cash flows and its fair value. Our future earnings and fair values relating to variable rate debt are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, such as SOFR. However, our Interest Rate Swaps are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts/premiums, consisted of approximately 1.2 billion in fixed rate debt (including the effect of interest rate swaps) and no variable debt. As such, there would be no impact to future earnings and cash flows if SOFR were to change. 
 Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur, which may result in us taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). Based upon, and as of the date of the evaluation, our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and chief financial officer (our principal financial officer) concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported when required. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 With the exception of the risk factors set forth below, which update and supplement the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Most of our properties are occupied by a single tenant; therefore, for each such property income generated by that property is dependent on the financial stability of a single tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable. Many events affecting our tenants could have a material adverse effect on us including, the bankruptcy, insolvency, or a general downturn in the business of, or a lease termination or election by a tenant not to renew, or other events affecting our tenants, could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our properties are primarily leased to single tenants or will derive a majority of their rental income from single tenants and, therefore, the income generated by these properties is materially dependent on the financial stability of our tenants and/or their parent companies and guarantors, as applicable. Our revenues depend on the financial condition of our tenants and/or their parents companies and guarantors, as applicable. Any event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a general downturn in the business of any of our tenants and/or their parent companies and guarantors, as applicable, a default by a tenant, the failure of a guarantor to fulfill its obligations, a premature termination of a lease, or a tenant s election not to extend a lease upon its expiration, could have a material adverse effect on us. Additionally, in certain instances, we may enter into leases that do not include a credit party guaranty or we may not be able to verify the credit quality of our tenants and/or their parents and guarantors, as applicable, prior to leasing our properties to such tenants. As a result, we may be exposed to a greater risk from such leases. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that our strategy of owning and operating industrial and office properties that are primarily leased to single tenants will be successful or that we will attain our investment and portfolio management objectives. Furthermore, although we have no current intention to do so, we may also invest in single-tenant, leased industrial and office properties outside of the United States and we can provide no assurance that we will have success in any such investments. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We actively monitor the creditworthiness of each tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable, to identify any material changes in quality and circumstances that could negatively impact the tenant s ability to satisfy its lease obligations. Our monitoring efforts include a routine review of the credit ratings of each tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable, that are available through public databases published by various rating agencies. When such credit ratings are not available, we utilize Bloomberg, a third-party database, to assess the implied credit ratings of each tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable. We also use our own internal processes for monitoring and identifying changes in potential tenant credit risk, which include a routine review of the financial statements (when available) of each tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable, insurance certificates and other documentation required by each lease, public disclosures and market information (e.g., SEC filings, press releases and investor calls) of each tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable, and general market intelligence involving micro-economic and macro-economic conditions that may impact the tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable. Notwithstanding our efforts, we may not be able to effectively monitor the credit quality, or identify material changes in the credit quality, of its tenant and/or its parent companies and guarantors, as applicable. 
 We face significant competition for tenants, which may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Furthermore, at the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for our properties. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The commercial real estate markets in which we operate are highly competitive. The leasing of real estate is also often highly competitive, and we may experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing properties. An oversupply of properties in the industries and geographies in which we concentrate could further increase competition. As a result, we may have to reduce our rental rates or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights, below-market renewal options or other lease incentive payments or we might not be able to timely lease the space. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights, below-market renewal options or other lease incentives in order to retain tenants when our leases expire. Competition for companies that may lease or guarantee our properties could decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had seven leases with unexercised early termination provisions, representing approximately 9.7 million of Annualized Base Rent (or 5 of our total Annualized Base Rent) and approximately 766,900 square feet (or 5 of our total square footage). As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any leases with exercised early termination provisions.

Table of Contents 

 The exercise of an early termination provision typically requires advance notification from the tenant (usually 12 months) and is frequently accompanied by the payment of a termination fee that reimburses us for a portion of the remaining rent under the original lease term. Termination fee income, included in rental income, is recognized on a straight-line basis from the date of the executed termination agreement through the revised lease expiration date when the amount of the fee is determinable and collectability of the fee is probable. This fee income is adjusted on a straight-line basis by any deferred rent related to the lease. We may re-lease the vacated space or sell the associated property after the exercise of an early termination provision. However, may experience delays and incur substantial costs in re-letting the space or experience a decrease in value of a property if the Company determines to sell such property while it is partially or completely vacant. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to lease the property for the rent previously received or sell the property without incurring a loss due to it being partially or completely vacant. Over the past two years, only one tenant exercised its early termination right with respect to a portion of its leased space, reducing its total leased square footage by 111,300 square feet. 
 Furthermore, at the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for our properties. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 We may be unable to renew expiring leases, or re-lease available space, above or at current market rental rates. 
 Market rental rates and the demand for our properties are impacted by general economic conditions, including the pace of economic growth and access to capital in the submarkets in which our properties are located. Therefore, there is no assurance that expiring leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased above, below or at current market rental rates.
