On March 27, 2024, those shareholders received additional share of common stock for every share owned. All references in this report to shares outstanding, weighted average shares outstanding, earnings per share, and dividends per share amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect this stock split.

billion of our outstanding common stock (the 2021 Repurchase Program ). The 2021 Repurchase Program began after completion of our prior repurchase program in January 2022 and was completed in May 2024. On July 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of billion of our outstanding common stock (the 2023 Repurchase Program ). The 2023 Repurchase Program, which does not have an expiration date, began after the completion of the 2021 Repurchase Program in May 2024. Under our repurchase programs, we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions. Shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. On May 28, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Agreement") with a third-party financial institution. The ASR Agreement is accounted for as a settled treasury stock purchase and a forward stock purchase contract. The par value of the initial shares received is recorded as a reduction to common stock, with the excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The forward stock purchase contract is accounted for as a contract indexed to our own stock and is classified within capital in excess of par value on our Condensed Balance Sheets. The ASR Agreement is settled with the final number of shares received based on the daily volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. Under the ASR Agreement, we paid the third-party financial institution million and received an initial delivery of shares of our common stock for million, representing approximately of the total value of shares to be received by us under the ASR Agreement. The remaining shares are expected to settle no later than November 2024. At September 30, 2024, our 2023 Repurchase Program had billion remaining available. The amount available and uncommitted is billion, which reflects the million forward stock purchase contract under the ASR Agreement.

Note Agreement On May 4, 2020, we entered into a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with PGIM, Inc. Prudential and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential (as subsequently amended on March 22, 2023 and August 28, 2024, the Note Agreement ). The Note Agreement, which is uncommitted and subject to Prudential s sole discretion, provides for the issuance of senior promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to million through March 22, 2026. On May 4, 2020, we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior promissory notes (the Series B Notes ). Borrowing availability under the Note Agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of the existing Series B Notes, and all other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement. per annum and mature on May 4, 2027, unless prepaid. The second principal payment of million was paid on May 4, 2024. The remaining million will be paid in three equal annual installments of million through . The Series B Notes are senior unsec ured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under our third amended and restated credit agreement, dated March 22, 2023, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as administrative agent for the lenders (as subsequently amended on August 28, 2024, the Credit Agreement or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement. Credit Agreement The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a million accordion feature, which if fully exercised and approved, would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of million. Of the million line of credit commitments under the Credit Agreement, up to million may be used for letters of credit. At our option, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus the Term SOFR Adjustment, as defined in the Credit Agreement, equal to , plus an applicable margin that ranges from to ; or (ii) a Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin that ranges from to . The applicable margin for each of the foregoing options is dependent upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio. Letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for SOFR loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. Commitment fees ranging from to (based upon our consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization ratio) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the Credit Agreement. For periods covered under the Credit Agreement, the applicable margin on SOFR loans and letter of credit fees were and commitment fees were . The Credit Agreement replaced our previous five-year, million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of November 21, 2019 (the Prior Credit Agreement ). For periods in 2023 covered under the Prior Cr edit Agreement, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans and letter of credit fees was and commitment fees were . There were million and million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt, including current maturities, was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value measurement of our Series B Notes was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis that factors in current market yields for comparable borrowing arrangements under our credit profile. Since this methodology is based upon market yields for comparable arrangements, the measurement is categorized as Level 2 under the three-level fair value hierarchy as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview 
 We are one of the largest North American less-than-truckload LTL motor carriers. We provide regional, inter-regional and national LTL services through a single integrated, union-free organization. Our service offerings, which include expedited transportation, are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental United States. Through strategic alliances, we also provide LTL services throughout North America. In addition to our core LTL services, we offer a range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting. More than 98 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting LTL shipments for our customers, whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the U.S. domestic economy. 
 In analyzing the components of our revenue, we monitor changes and trends in our LTL volumes and LTL revenue per hundredweight. While LTL revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement, it is also a commonly-used indicator for general pricing trends in the LTL industry. This yield metric is not a true measure of price, however, as it can be influenced by many other factors, such as changes in fuel surcharges, weight per shipment and length of haul. As a result, changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates. LTL revenue per hundredweight and the key factors that can impact this metric are described in more detail below: 
 LTL Revenue Per Hundredweight - Our LTL transportation services are generally priced based on weight, commodity, and distance. This measurement reflects the application of our pricing policies to the services we provide, which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives. Generally, freight is rated by a class system, which is established by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc. Light, bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense, heavy freight. Fuel surcharges, accessorial charges, revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement, and we regularly monitor the components that impact our pricing. The fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of our petroleum-based products and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the U.S. Department of Energy, which reset each week. Revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we believe including it in our revenue per hundredweight metrics results in a more accurate representation of the underlying changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments. 

LTL Weight Per Shipment - Fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the mix of freight we receive from our customers, as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment. Generally, increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity. Changes in weight per shipment can also be influenced by shifts between LTL and other modes of transportation, such as truckload and intermodal, in response to capacity, service and pricing issues. Fluctuations in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as a decrease in weight per shipment will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight. 

Average Length of Haul - We consider lengths of haul less than 500 miles to be regional traffic, lengths of haul between 500 miles and 1,000 miles to be inter-regional traffic, and lengths of haul in excess of 1,000 miles to be national traffic. This metric is used to analyze our tonnage and pricing trends for shipments with similar characteristics, and also allows for comparison with other transportation providers serving specific markets. By analyzing this metric, we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets. Changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight. 

LTL Revenue Per Shipment - This measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used in conjunction with the number of LTL shipments we receive to evaluate LTL revenue. 

Our primary revenue focus is to increase density, which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure. Increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity, which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor, pickup and delivery P D stops per hour, P D shipments per hour, platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour. In addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies, it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield, which is measured as revenue per hundredweight, on the shipments we handle. We focus on the profitability of each customer account and generally seek to obtain an appropriate yield to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. We believe the continued execution of this 
 10 

yield-management philosophy, continued increases in density, and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies are the key components of our ability to produce further improvement in our operating ratio and long-term profitable growth. 
 Our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight, operating supplies and expenses, which include diesel fuel, and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities. We gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio, a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue, which also allows for industry-wide comparisons with our competition. 
 We regularly upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs. Our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network, increases the productivity of our workforce, and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes.

All references in this report to shares outstanding, weighted average shares outstanding, earnings per share, and dividends per share amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect the two-for-one stock split effected in March 2024. 
 Our financial results for the third quarter of 2024 include year-over-year decreases in revenue and profitability whereas the financial results for the first nine months of 2024 include year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability. While the domestic economy remained sluggish during the third quarter of 2024, our LTL shipments per day remained relatively consistent with the first half of 2024 and our yield continued to improve. The consistency in our volumes and yield performance during the quarter continued to be supported by our best-in-class service as we once again provided our customers with 99 on-time service and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1 during the quarter. We also maintained our focus on operating efficiently and controlling discretionary spending during the quarter, but the deleveraging effect from the decrease in revenue led to an increase in our operating ratio. As a result, our net income and earnings per diluted share decreased by 9.1 and 7.1 , respectively, for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 and increased 0.7 and 2.2 , respectively, for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased 45.1 million, or 3.0 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 due to a decrease in volumes that was partially offset by an increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. LTL tonnage per day decreased 4.8 in the third quarter of 2024 due primarily to a decrease in LTL shipments per day and a decrease in LTL weight per shipment. Revenue increased 58.4 million, or 1.3 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 due to an increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight that was partially offset by a decrease in volumes. LTL tonnage per day decreased 2.0 for the first nine months of 2024 due primarily to a decrease in LTL weight per shipment and a decrease in LTL shipments per day. Both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 had one additional operating day compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 1.5 and 3.3 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 4.6 and 5.3 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to the success of our long-term yield management strategy. Our consistent, cost-based approach to pricing focuses on offsetting our cost inflation while also supporting additional investments into our business to expand capacity and enhance our technology. 
 October 2024 Update 
 Revenue per day decreased 10.9 in October 2024 as compared to the same month last year due primarily to a 9.1 decrease in LTL tons per day and a 2.0 decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. The decrease in LTL tons per day resulted from an 8.9 decrease in LTL shipments per day and a 0.2 decrease in LTL weight per shipment. LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 3.2 as compared to the same month last year.

Operating Costs and Other Expenses 
 Salaries, wages and benefits increased 17.4 million, or 2.6 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to a 8.3 million increase in salaries and wages and a 9.1 million increase in employee benefit costs. Salaries, wages and benefits increased 74.7 million, or 3.8 , for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023, due to a 56.4 million increase in salaries and wages and a 18.3 million increase in employee benefit costs. 
 Our salaries and wages expenses were higher for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods of 2023, which was attributable to the annual wage increase provided to employees in September 2024 and 2023. In addition, our average number of active full-time employees increased 0.8 and 0.5 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as we balanced our workforce with anticipated shipment trends. 
 Our productive labor costs, which include wages for drivers, platform employees, and fleet technicians, increased as a percent of revenue to 24.0 in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to 23.1 and 23.5 for the same periods of 2023. We continued to operate efficiently during the third quarter, despite the decrease in network density that generally resulted from the decline in volumes. Our P D and platform shipments per hour both improved in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, which helped offset the reduction in our linehaul laden load factor. Our other salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also increased to 9.4 and 9.5 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to 8.8 and 9.1 for the same periods of 2023. 
 The costs attributable to employee benefits were higher for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same periods of 2023, due primarily to the annual wage increase and the slight increase in our average number of active full-time employees. As a result, our employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages increased to 38.6 for the third quarter of 2024 from 37.3 in the comparable period of 2023 and decreased to 37.1 for the first nine months of 2024 from 37.3 in the comparable period of 2023. Our costs attributable to employee benefits for the third quarter of 2024 were also negatively impacted by higher costs associated with our group health and dental plans, which contributed to the increase in these costs as a percent of salaries and wages. 
 Operating supplies and expenses decreased 24.5 million and 48.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, due to decreases in our costs for diesel fuel used in our vehicles and lower maintenance and repair costs. The cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption. Our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel decreased 20.5 and 12.4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year. We do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments; therefore, our costs are subject to market price fluctuations. Our gallons consumed decreased 4.2 and 2.7 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year, due primarily to a decrease in miles driven. Our other operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was relatively consistent in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, but decreased in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. This year-to-date decrease is due primarily to lower maintenance and repair costs, as we improved the average age of our fleet by consistently executing on our capital expenditure programs. 
 Depreciation and amortization costs increased 2.6 million and 16.0 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The increases in depreciation and amortization were due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2023 and 2024 capital expenditure programs. We believe depreciation costs will increase in future periods based on our 2024 capital expenditure plan. While our investments in real estate, equipment, and technology can increase our costs in the short-term, we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued long-term growth and strategic initiatives. 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 23.4 and 24.5 , respectively, as compared to 24.0 and 25.0 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. Our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and, to a lesser extent, certain other non-deductible items.

The change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 was due primarily to increases in net income as well as fluctuations in working capital accounts. 
 The change in our cash flows used in investing activities during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 was impacted by the timing of expenditures under our 2023 and 2024 capital expenditure programs and the timing of purchases and maturities of short-term investments. Changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below in Capital Expenditures." 
 The change in our cash flows used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023 was due primarily to higher repurchases of our common stock, as well as an increase in dividend payments to our shareholders. Our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under Stock Repurchase Program and Dividends to Shareholders. 
 We have four primary sources of available liquidity: cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our third amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association serving as administrative agent for the lenders, dated March 22, 2023, as amended by the First Amendment dated August 28, 2024 (as amended, the Credit Agreement ), and our Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with PGIM, Inc. Prudential and certain affiliates and managed accounts of Prudential, as amended by the First Amendment dated March 22, 2023 and the Second Amendment dated August 28, 2024 (as amended, the Note Agreement ). The Credit Agreement and the Note Agreement are described in more detail below under Financing Arrangements. We believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity, if needed. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:

Our capital expenditures vary based upon the change in the number and size of our service center facilities necessary to support our plan for long-term growth, our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle, and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth. Expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand. We historically spend 10 to 15 of our revenue on capital expenditures each year, and we generally expect to continue to maintain this level of capital expenditures in order to support our long-term plan for market share growth. There could be years, 
 14 

however, where our annual capital expenditures plan is above or below this range as we balance the size of our service center network and operating fleet with anticipated growth. 
 We currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 750 million for the year ending December 31, 2024. Approximately 350 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities, construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities, subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects; approximately 325 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers; and approximately 75 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets. We expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents and, if needed, borrowings available under our Credit Agreement or Note Agreement. We believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 On July 28, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock (the 2021 Repurchase Program ). The 2021 Repurchase Program began after completion of our prior repurchase program in January 2022 and was completed in May 2024. 
 On July 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 3.0 billion of our outstanding common stock (the 2023 Repurchase Program ). The 2023 Repurchase Program, which does not have an expiration date, began after the completion of the 2021 Repurchase Program in May 2024. 
 Under our repurchase programs, we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions. Shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. 
 On May 28, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Agreement") with a third-party financial institution. The ASR Agreement is accounted for as a settled treasury stock purchase and a forward stock purchase contract. The par value of the initial shares received is recorded as a reduction to common stock, with the excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The forward stock purchase contract is accounted for as a contract indexed to our own stock and is classified within capital in excess of par value on our Condensed Balance Sheets. The ASR Agreement is settled with the final number of shares received based on the daily volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. 
 Under the ASR Agreement, we paid the third-party financial institution 200.0 million and received an initial delivery of 923,201 shares of our common stock for 160.0 million, representing approximately 80 of the total value of shares to be received by us under the ASR Agreement. The remaining shares are expected to settle no later than November 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, our 2023 Repurchase Program had 2.44 billion remaining available. The amount available and uncommitted is 2.40 billion, which reflects the 40.0 million forward stock purchase contract under the ASR Agreement. 
 Dividends to Shareholders 
 On February 16, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock for shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of March 13, 2024. On March 27, 2024, those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every share owned. 
 All references in this report to dividend amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect this stock split. Split-adjusted per-share metrics may not recalculate precisely due to rounding. 
 Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.26 per share for each quarter of 2024 and declared a cash dividend of 0.20 per share for each quarter of 2023. 
 Although we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future, the declaration and amount of any future dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and is restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our Credit Agreement and Note Agreement. We anticipate that any future quarterly cash dividends will be funded through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents and, if needed, borrowings under our Credit Agreement or Note Agreement.

Financing Agreements 
 Note Agreement 
 The Note Agreement, which is uncommitted and subject to Prudential s sole discretion, provides for the issuance of senior promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to 350.0 million through March 22, 2026. On May 4, 2020, we issued 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior promissory notes (the Series B Notes ). Borrowing availability under the Note Agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of the existing Series B Notes, and all other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement. 
 The Series B Notes bear interest at 3.10 per annum and mature on May 4, 2027, unless prepaid. The second principal payment of 20.0 million was paid on May 4, 2024. The remaining 60.0 million will be paid in three equal annual installments of 20.0 million through May 4, 2027. The Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with borrowings under the Credit Agreement or other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the Note Agreement. 
 Credit Agreement 
 The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, 250.0 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a 150.0 million accordion feature, which if fully exercised and approved, would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of 400.0 million. Of the 250.0 million line of credit commitments under the Credit Agreement, up to 100.0 million may be used for letters of credit. 
 At our option, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either: (i) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus the Term SOFR Adjustment, as defined in the Credit Agreement, equal to 0.100 , plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.000 to 1.375 ; or (ii) a Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.000 to 0.375 . The applicable margin for each of the foregoing options is dependent upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio. Letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for SOFR loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. Commitment fees ranging from 0.090 to 0.175 (based upon our consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the Credit Agreement. 
 For periods covered under the Credit Agreement, the applicable margin on SOFR loans and letter of credit fees were 1.000 and commitment fees were 0.090 .

General Debt Provisions 
 The Credit Agreement and Note Agreement contain customary covenants, including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement and Note Agreement also include a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments, including dividends and payments for share repurchases, unless, among other conditions, no defaults or events of default are ongoing (or would be caused by such restricted payment). We were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 We do not anticipate financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future, and we believe the combination of our existing Credit Agreement and Note Agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long-term capital needs. 
 The interest rate is fixed on the Series B Notes. Therefore, short-term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our Credit Agreement. We do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. 
 16 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 In preparing our condensed financial statements, we applied the same critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. 
 Seasonality 
 Our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry, although other factors, such as macroeconomic changes, could cause variation in these trends. Our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months. We believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business; however, our tonnage trends could continue to be inconsistent with historical trends until there is a sustained improvement in the domestic economy. Harsh winter weather, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other natural disasters can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses. 
 Environmental Regulation 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on, among other things: the disposal, emission and discharge of hazardous waste, hazardous materials, or other materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles; fuel storage tanks; transportation of certain materials; and the discharge or retention of storm water. Under specific environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with clean-up of accidents involving our vehicles. We do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, competitive position or capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024. However, future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business.

PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in or addressing various legal proceedings and claims, governmental inquiries, notices and investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and have not been fully adjudicated, some of which may be covered in whole or in part by insurance. Certain of these matters include collective and/or class-action allegations. We do not believe that the resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Consistent with SEC Regulation S-K Item 103, we have elected to disclose any environmental legal proceedings with a governmental authority if management reasonably believes that the proceedings may involve potential monetary sanctions of 1.0 million or more. Applying this threshold, there are no such unresolved proceedings to disclose as of September 30, 2024. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report and in our other reports and statements that we file with the SEC, including our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, careful consideration should be given to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.
