Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost basis of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by states and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of promotional loans paid off prior to the end of their promotional periods while million and million, respectively, of promotional loans reached the end of the promotional period and began amortizing. Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million and million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower s debt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual status if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.

Modifications Provided to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted, the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether the concession results in a modification that is accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan under U.S. GAAP. Although each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, loans modified as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically modified through reductions in interest rates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity. For the quarter-ended June 30, 2024, one loan with an amortized cost basis of thousand was modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, representing of the secured by first liens loan segment. This loan was modified to reduce the interest rate to from through its 6/16/2042 maturity. Additionally, during the quarter, one loan with an amortized cost of thousand, assigned to secured by first liens and constituting of this portfolio was no longer designated as a financial difficulty modification. This loan, recognized as an FDM in February 22, 2023, resumed contractual payments in August 2023 and has had 15 consecutive months of satisfactory performance.

 thousand in amortized cost and representing of this segment, have had no payment delinquencies in the quarter. Of these two modifications, one loan with thousand in amortized cost, was modified to interest only payments for eleven months, with a return to principal and interest payments in August 2024. Total contractual payments for this loan prior to modification would have been . The other existing consumer loan, with thousand in amortized cost was modified to interest only payments for nine months, with principal and interest payments to resume June 2024. Total contractual payments, prior to modification, for this quarter would have been . Another existing, revolving 1-4 family modification with a thousand amortized cost and amounting to of its assigned loan pool, has paid as agreed in the quarter. This loan was modified from its original rate to a fixed for a term. Total contractual payments, prior to modification, for this quarter would have been . Residential 1-4 family Consumer loans Total The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies certain loans by providing principal forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. If it is determined that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. At that time, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. Credit Quality Indicators Through its system of internal controls, Primis evaluates and segments loan portfolio credit quality using regulatory definitions for Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Special Mention loans are considered to be criticized. Substandard and Doubtful loans are considered to be classified. Special Mention loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position. Substandard loans may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Table of Contents 
 loans classified as Doubtful as of June 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. In monitoring credit quality trends in the context of assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on loans, we monitor portfolio credit quality by the weighted-average risk grade of each class of loan.

Allowance For Credit Losses Loans The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but are not limited to (i) commercial real estate - owner occupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv) commercial, (v) agricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is necessary. For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing

The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate. Best efforts and mandatory forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both best efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are mandatory delivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Forward loan sale commitments that are best efforts are not derivatives but can be and have been accounted for at fair value, determined in a similar manner to

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures: Credit loss expense ) ) Balance as of June 30 Commitments Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.

This higher rate environment is continuing to put strong margin pressure on all banks, including Primis, as the cost of deposits has increased alongside the Fed rate increases while many loans in banks portfolios are fixed due to borrowers locking in historic low rates in the past few years prior to the rate hikes noted above. However, loan growth in the current environment will benefit from the higher rates and should assist in partially offsetting growth in deposit costs. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024 totaled 3.4 million, or 0.14 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to a net loss of 2.0 million, or 0.08) basic and diluted loss per share for the three months ended June 30, 2023.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Three-Month Comparison. Net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2024 totaled 3.4 million, or 0.14 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to a net loss of 2.0 million, or (0.08) basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net income during the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 was driven primarily by 1.5 million higher net interest income, 1.9 million higher noninterest income, 0.7 million lower noninterest expense, and 1.2 million less provision for credit losses on loans. Additional details of each of these will be discussed in the remaining sections of this Results of Operations discussion. Six-Month Comparison. Net income available to common shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled 5.9 million, or 0.24 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to 6.4 million, or 0.26 basic and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The results between the two periods were relatively unchanged due to an increase in net interest income of 1.5 million and noncontrolling interests of 3.6 million offset by a decline of 5.4 million in noninterest income. Noncontrolling interests related to losses attributable to other stockholders of an entity that we are required to consolidated under U.S. GAAP in which we own approximately 19 . Details of the other key areas comprising our net income during the six months will be discussed in the remaining sections of this Results of Operations discussion. Net Interest Income Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Three-Month Comparison. Net interest income was 24.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 23.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Our net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 2.72 , compared to 2.36 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Margin increased by 36 basis points as a result of net interest income growing by 1.5 million while average interest earning assets decreased from the prior year. The growth in income was due to interest earning asset yield growth of 65 basis points outpacing interest bearing liability rate growth of 37 basis points. Higher lending rates fueled by an increase in benchmark rates year-over-year and the redeployment of excess cash into higher yielding assets drove interest income. Average interest bearing assets declined as a result of our decision on June 30, 2023 to begin sweeping excess cash off the balance sheet that had accumulated as a result of the increase in deposits from growth of our digital deposit platform during the three months ended June 30, 2023. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased primarily due to benchmark interest rate increases in all deposits and higher average borrowings, partially offset by a decline in average interest-bearing deposits as a result of the aforementioned sweep activity since June 30, 2023.

 Six-Month Comparison. Net interest income was 50.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 48.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Our net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 2.78 , compared to 2.57 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Margin increased by 21 basis points as a result of net interest income growing by 1.5 million while average interest earning assets decreased from the prior year. The growth in income was due to interest earning asset yield growth of 69 basis points outpacing interest bearing liability rate growth of 56 basis points. Higher lending rates fueled by an increase in benchmark rates year-over-year and the redeployment of excess cash into higher yielding assets drove interest income. Average interest bearing assets declined as a result of our decision to sweep excess cash off of the balance sheet as described in the three-month comparison. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased primarily due to increases in rates on all interest-bearing liabilities as a result of benchmark interest rate increases, partially offset by a 4 decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities.

 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses is a current charge to earnings made in order to adjust the allowance for credit losses for current expected losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio characteristics, current economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending, historical loan experience and other known internal and external factors affecting loan collectability, and assessment of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions that would impact collectability of the loans. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by considering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management s judgment. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, of 3.1 million and 4.4 million, respectively. The provision included amounts calculated in our normal reserve process for the Consumer Program loans which totaled 3.6 million and 1.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,

 respectively. Our provision for credit losses was driven by provisions related to the Consumer Program loan portfolio primarily centered around loans originated from the third quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the provision amounts related to the Consumer Program portfolio, we recorded a benefit for credit losses of 0.5 million and a provision of 3.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provisions were driven in part by net charge-offs during the periods which were 5.0 million and 1.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, 4.3 million and 1.4 million, respectively, of net charge-offs were related to the Consumer Program loans. These charge-offs were primarily related to loans originated from the third quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the Consumer Program loan charge-offs we had net charge-offs of 0.7 million and 0.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for both the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, of 9.6 million. The provision included amounts calculated in our normal reserve process for the Consumer Program loans which totaled 8.6 million and 6.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our provision for credit losses was driven by provisions related to the Consumer Program loan portfolio primarily centered around loans originated from the third quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the provision amounts related to the Consumer Program portfolio, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 1.0 million and 3.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provisions were driven in part by net charge-offs during the periods which were 10.3 million and 5.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, 8.7 million and 3.3 million, respectively, of net charge-offs were related to the Consumer Program loans. These charge-offs were primarily related to loans originated from the third quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the Consumer Program loan charge-offs we had net charge-offs of 1.6 million and 2.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively The Financial Condition section of this MD A provides information on our loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest Income The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023: 

For the Three Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 1,861 1,457 404 Income from bank-owned life insurance 981 394 587 Mortgage banking income 6,402 5,198 1,204 Gain on sale of loans (29) (29) Consumer Program derivative 1,272 1,758 (486) Other noninterest income 365 130 235 Total noninterest income 10,852 8,937 1,915 Noninterest income increased 21 to 10.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 8.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to 1.2 million of higher mortgage banking income and 0.6 million of higher income from bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by a decline in Consumer Program derivative income. The increase in Mortgage banking income was a result of the continued growth of the mortgage business in 2024 compared to 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 we realized 3.7 million on sale gains compared to 2.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of higher sales volumes. The increase in income on bank-owned life insurance was driven by one-time death benefit gains during the

 quarter of 0.6 million. The Consumer Program derivative income declined primarily due to fair value loss adjustments on the derivative asset of 0.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to fair value gains of 0.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023. Offsetting the fair value loss adjustments during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.1 million and 1.2 million, respectively, of realized gains as a result of borrowers paying off their promotional period loans before the end of the promotional period which triggers payment from the derivative counterparty of the interest accrued during the promotional period along with other income due to us under the agreement. The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023: 

For the Six Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 3,254 2,681 573 Income from bank-owned life insurance 1,544 814 730 Mortgage banking income 11,976 9,513 2,463 Gain on sale of loans 307 51 256 Consumer Program derivative 3,313 13,201 (9,888) Other noninterest income 764 347 417 Total noninterest income 21,158 26,607 (5,449) Noninterest income decreased 20 to 21.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 26.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by declines in Consumer Program derivative income, partially offset by 2.5 million of higher mortgage banking income and 0.7 million of higher income from bank-owned life insurance. The Consumer Program derivative income declined primarily due to fair value loss adjustments on the derivative asset of 0.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to fair value gains of 11.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The derivative asset and related gains are driven by anticipated cash payments due to us from the third-party when borrowers prepay their loans in a no-interest promotional period. During the first six months of 2023, the value of the derivative and related gains were driven by 52.3 million of loans with a no-interest promotional period originated during the first six months. Comparatively, during the first six months of 2024 a nominal amount of no-interest promotional loans was originated and the existing ones were beginning to exit their promo period. Offsetting the fair value loss adjustments during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and adding to the gains in 2023 was 4.2 million and 2.1 million, respectively, of realized gains as a result of borrowers paying off their promotional period loans before the end of the promotional period which triggers payment from the derivative counterparty of the interest accrued during the promotional period, along with other income due to us under the agreement. The increase in Mortgage banking income was a result of the continued growth of the mortgage business in 2024 compared to 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 we realized 6.5 million on sale gains compared to 5.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of higher sales volumes. The increase in income on bank-owned life insurance was driven by one-time death benefit gains during the six months of 0.7 million.

 Noninterest Expense The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023: 

For the Three Months Ended June 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Salaries and benefits 16,088 15,283 805 Occupancy expenses 1,250 1,593 (343) Furniture and equipment expenses 1,849 1,852 (3) Amortization of core deposit intangible 317 318 (1) Virginia franchise tax expense 632 848 (216) FDIC insurance assessment 589 1,070 (481) Data processing expense 2,347 2,828 (481) Marketing expense 499 521 (22) Telephone and communication expense 341 416 (75) Professional fees 2,976 1,075 1,901 Fraud losses 17 1,997 (1,980) Miscellaneous lending expenses 285 568 (283) Other operating expenses 2,596 2,070 526 Total noninterest expenses 29,786 30,439 (653) Noninterest expenses declined 2 to 29.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 30.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decline was driven by higher fraud losses, FDIC insurance assessments and data processing costs in the prior year, partially offset by higher professional fees and salaries and benefits in 2024. The fraud losses during the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily related to a substantial increase in deposit account fraud, which was also seen across the industry during that time. The FDIC insurance costs were higher during the three months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of the higher deposit base driven by the growth of the digital platform compared to the same period in 2024, less growth in deposits, and excess deposit cash sweeps being utilized during the quarter. The data processing expenses were higher during the three months ended June 30, 2023 driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during 2023 that did not re-occur in 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 these declines in noninterest expenses were offset by higher professional fees related to the SEC pre-clearance and restatement process. The higher salaries and benefits expense was driven by growth in the mortgage line of business and Panacea division.

Decreases in expenses were driven by fraud losses (recoveries), miscellaneous lending expenses, and data processing and were offset by increases in professional fees and salaries and benefits. The decreases in noninterest expenses in fraud losses (recoveries) and data processing was primarily for the same reasons as discussed above for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in miscellaneous lending expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily related to a decline in the calculated credit loss reserve for unfunded commitments. The offsetting increases in noninterest expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 2023 in professional fees and salaries and benefits was primarily for the same reasons as discussed above for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 2023.

 Loans Gross loans were 3.3 billion and 3.2 billion as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a majority of our loans were to customers located in Virginia and Maryland. We are not dependent on any single customer or group of customers whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our loan portfolio grew 2.5 in the first six months of 2024 which was driven by growth in multi-family residential, non-owner occupied commercial real estate, and consumer loans. The majority of this growth was concentrated in loan growth in the Panacea and Life Premium Finance divisions that are diversified geographically and are spread across the nation. The overall loan portfolio growth was partially offset by a reduction in our construction and land development portfolio due to paydows of loans in that portfolio. On October 24, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with EverBank for sale of the Conpany s LPF division. EverBank will acquire LPF from the Company, except for a subset of mostly fixed rate and rate-capped loans that will be retained by the Bank. All of the LPF operations, including its employees, will be assumed by EverBank as part of the transaction that is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of 4.5 million for the Company, net of advisory and legal fees, at the initial closing in the fourth quarter of 2024. EverBank will acquire approximately 370 million of loans from the division with the Bank providing interim servicing until the transition of the business at the final closing which is expected on January 31, 2025. Between the first and second closings, EverBank will purchase loans generated by the division in ordinary course at par. After the second closing, EverBank will service the Bank s retained portfolio for the duration of the portfolio. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had not made the decision to sell LPF and had not identified specific loans that it might sell, therefore the amortized cost balance of the loans remains in loans held for investment on the condensed consolidated balance sheets in Item 1 in this Form 10-Q and where loans held for investment are disclosed in this MD A. The composition of our loans held for investment portfolio consisted of the following as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

 Asset Quality; Past Due Loans and Nonperforming Assets The following table presents a comparison of nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 

June 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Nonaccrual loans 11,289 9,095 Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest 1,897 1,714 Total nonperforming assets 13,186 10,809 SBA guaranteed amounts included in nonperforming loans 3,268 3,115 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 1.56 1.62 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 456.88 574.06 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 391.14 483.04 Nonaccrual to total loans 0.34 0.28 Nonperforming assets excluding SBA guaranteed loans to total assets 0.25 0.20 Asset quality remained relatively stable during the first six months of 2024 with nonperforming assets up 2.4 million to 13.2 million primarily as a result of an increase in nonaccrual loans. The increase was driven by one commercial real estate loan, three commercial loans, and five consumer loans added to nonaccrual during the year. Two of the commercial loans have partial SBA guarantees and all but one of these loans is secured by collateral. We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections. We maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure occurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio management practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the value of the real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy, rising or elevated interest rates, historically high or persistent inflation, and recessionary concerns. We originate a portion of our consumer loans (the Consumer Program) using a third party that sources and subsequently manages the portfolio of loans. As of June 30, 2024, the principal balance outstanding was 194.2 million. These loans are accounted for similar to our other consumer loans and are not placed on nonaccrual because they are charged off when they become 90 days past due. The allowance on this portfolio of loans was 22.3 million as of June 30, 2024 and represented 43 of our total allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs on this portfolio were 4.3 million and 8.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and represented approximately 87 and 85 , respectively, of net charge-offs recorded during the periods. The Company tightened its origination criteria in regard to this portfolio in April of 2023 and from that point forward we generally originated loans to consumer borrowers being managed by the third party with FICO scores over 720, whereas prior periods loan production included approximately 40 of loans to borrowers with weaker credit scores. This older vintage, lower credit score portion of the portfolio has driven the uptick in related charge-offs during 2023 which continued into the first six months of 2024 and necessitated the update of the Company s expected loss rates on this portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023. This updated loss rate has been a driver in the increase of the allowance on the portfolio. The newer production represented 

 51 

Table of Contents 
 approximately 33 of the portfolio as of June 30, 2024 and is expected to improve the quality mix of the portfolio and result in lower realized net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses in future periods. Investment Securities The following table sets forth a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value, and held-to-maturity investment securities are reported at amortized cost (in thousands). 

June 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Available-for-sale investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 90,762 96,808 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 29,693 30,080 Corporate securities 13,726 14,048 Collateralized loan obligations 5,008 4,982 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 48,854 34,471 Government-sponsored agency securities 13,668 13,711 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 27,311 30,110 SBA pool securities 3,845 4,210 Total 232,867 228,420 Held-to-maturity investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 8,392 9,040 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 2,069 2,391 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 188 219 Total 10,649 11,650 Debt investment securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Our portfolio of available-for-sale securities currently contains a material amount of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments due to increases in market interest rates since the original purchase of many of these securities. We intend to hold these securities until maturity or recovery of the value and do not anticipate realizing any losses on the investments. Investment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled 243.5 million as of June 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4 from 240.1 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by paydowns, maturities, and calls of the investments over the past six months. We recognized no credit impairment charges related to credit losses on our held-to-maturity investment securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and an immaterial amount of credit impairment charges were taken during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. For additional information regarding investment securities refer to Note 2 - Investment Securities in this Form 10-Q. Deposits and Other Borrowings Deposits The market for deposits is competitive. We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings 

 52 

Table of Contents 
 accounts and certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, as well as nationally through advertising and online banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending, purchasing of investment securities and for other business purposes. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and in responding to the threat of disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the effect of such retention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general economy and market rates of interest. Total deposits were 3.3 billion as of June 30, 2024, a 2 increase from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits from year end was primarily driven by growth in money market and savings accounts due to our competitive rates on these products. Savings accounts increased 11 from 783.8 million as of December 31, 2023 to 866.3 million as of June 30, 2024. Money market accounts increased 5 from 794.5 million as of December 31, 2023 to 831.8 million as of June 30, 2024. Our deposits are diversified in type and by underlying customer and lack significant concentrations to any type of customer (i.e. commercial, consumer, government) or industry. Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance were 849.3 million, or 25 of total deposits, as of June 30, 2024. Other Borrowings We use other borrowed funds to support our liquidity needs and to temporarily satisfy our funding needs from increased loan demand and for other shorter term purposes. We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and interest rates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with purchases of FHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total FHLB borrowings were 80.0 million and 30.0 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, we had 517.6 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit. Other borrowings can consist of federal funds purchased, secured borrowings due to failed loan sales, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance in repo accounts at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 3.3 million and 3.0 million, respectively. We had secured borrowings of 21.1 million and 20.4 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to loan transfers to another financial institution during 2023 and the first six months of 2024 that did not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale under relevant accounting guidance. These borrowings reflect the cash received for transferring the loans to the other financial institution and any unamortized sale premium and are secured by approximately the same amount of loans held for investment that are recorded in our balance sheet. We retained the servicing of the loans that were transferred and accordingly receive principal and interest from the borrower as contractually required and transfer the interest to the other financial institution net of our contractually agreed upon servicing fee. The loans transferred have an average maturity of approximately ten years which will be the time over which the principal balance of the loans in our balance sheet and secured borrowings will pay down, absent borrower prepayments. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, additional advances were made to borrowers under the loans previously transferred in 2023 and were accordingly treated as additional secured borrowings as of June 30, 2024. For additional information on secured borrowings refer to Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings in this Form 10-Q.

 Junior Subordinated Debt and Senior Subordinated Notes For information about junior subordinated debt and senior subordinated notes and their anticipated principal repayments refer to Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings. Liquidity and Funds Management The objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund commitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits are not sufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including but not limited to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and institutional certificates of deposits. In addition, we maintain federal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks, totaling 75 million, and utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers as needed. For additional information about borrowings and anticipated principal repayments refer to Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings, and Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies. We prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and two year basis. These projections incorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate risk analyses. As of June 30, 2024, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of June 30, 2024, Primis has no material commitments or long-term debt for capital expenditures. Capital Resources Capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Primis Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under regulatory framework for PCA. Federal banking agencies do not provide a similar well capitalized threshold for bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of June 30, 2024, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

 (1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level. 
 Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines Basel III aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had a capital conservation buffer of 4.30 as of June 30, 2024, which exceeded the 2.50 minimum requirement below which the regulators may impose limits on distributions. Primis Bank s capital position is consistent with being well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Disclosures regarding changes in our significant accounting policies since year end and the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in Note 1 - Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q. There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during the first six months of 2024. ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability Committee ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed 

 55 

Table of Contents 
 and approved by our Board of Directors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk. We use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk, and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using assumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. Based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 400 basis points, measured in 100 basis point increments) as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all changes are within our Asset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines. Our interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in the net interest income NII over a range of interest rate scenarios. NII depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are within our ALM Policy guidelines as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE and NII sensitivity requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE tables and NII tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII. Sensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches. ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer CEO and chief financial officer CFO ), we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This conclusion was reached as a result of the continued remediation of previously identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting as further described in Item 9A in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that have not been fully remediated, the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in this Form 10-Q, as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash-flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the 

 56 

Table of Contents 
 Company continued to remediate the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as previously identified and disclosed in Item 9A. in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes it has put effective controls in place to remediate the previously identified material weaknesses, the controls have not been operating for a sufficient amount of time to conclude that the material weakness has been fully remediated. The Company will continue to operate and test the new controls until it believes they have been operating effectively for a sufficient amount of time. The Company anticipates the material weaknesses to be fully remediated as soon as possible. PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Primis and Primis Bank are from time to time a party, as both plaintiff and defendant, to various claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Bank s business, including administrative and/or legal proceedings that may include employment-related claims, as well as claims of lender liability, breach of contract, and other similar lending-related claims. While the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time, the Bank s management presently believes that such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. There are no proceedings pending, or to management s knowledge, threatened, that represent a significant risk against Primis or Primis Bank as of June 30, 2024. ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, in evaluating an investment in the Company s securities, investors should consider carefully, among other things, the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or future results. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or the trading price of our securities. There are no material changes during the period covered by this Report to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.
