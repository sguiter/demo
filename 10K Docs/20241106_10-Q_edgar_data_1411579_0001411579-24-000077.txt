 AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 (Unaudited) reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which was derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10 Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, these interim financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations. Due to the seasonal nature of the Company s business, results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Until such time as the Company is able to achieve sustainable net positive cash flows provided by operating activities, it is difficult to estimate the Company s future cash burn rates and liquidity requirements. Depending on the Company s assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve increased levels of revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. There can be no assurance that the revenues, attendance levels, and other assumptions used to estimate the Company s liquidity requirements and future cash burn rates will be correct, and the ability to be predictive is uncertain due to limited ability to predict studio film release dates, the overall production and theatrical release levels, and success of individual titles. Additionally, the effects of labor stoppages that occurred during 2023 had a negative impact in 2024 on the film slate for exhibition, the Company s liquidity and cash burn rates. Further, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet the Company s obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The Company expects, from time to time, to continue to seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as it may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, its liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense is expected to be recognized is approximately years. Special Awards On February 22, 2024, the compensation committee of AMC s Board of Directors Compensation Committee approved modification of the performance goals applicable to all 2023 Tranche Year PSU awards. This was accounted for as a modification to the 2023 Tranche Year PSU awards which lowered the Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance targets such that vesting was achieved for both targets. This modification resulted in the immediate additional vesting of 2023 Tranche Year PSUs cash settled units and equity settled units). This was treated as a Type 3 modification (improbable-to-probable) which required the Company to recognize additional stock compensation expense based on the modification date fair values of the incremental PSUs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of stock compensation expense related to these awards. On February 23, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved special awards in lieu of vesting of the 2022 Tranche Year PSU awards.

Performance Stock Unit Awards: A total of PSUs were awarded 2024 PSU award to certain members of management and executive officers, with the total PSUs divided into three separate year tranches, with each tranche allocated to a fiscal year within the performance period Tranche Year ). The PSUs within each Tranche Year are further divided between two performance targets: the Adjusted EBITDA performance target and the free cash flow performance target. The 2024 PSU awards will vest if to of the performance targets are attained, with the corresponding vested unit amount ranging from to of the PSUs awarded. If the performance targets are met at , the 2024 PSU awards will vest at units in the aggregate. PSUs will vest for each Tranche Year if the Company does not achieve 80 of the Tranche Year s Adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow targets. 
 The Compensation Committee establishes the annual performance targets at the beginning of each year. Therefore, the grant date (and fair value measurement date) for each Tranche Year is the date at the beginning of each year when a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions are reached per ASC 718, Compensation Stock compensation. The equity classified 2024 PSU award grant date fair value for the 2024 Tranche Year award of units was approximately million, the equity classified 2023 PSU award grant date fair value for the 2024 Tranche Year award of units was million and the equity classified 2022 PSU award grant date fair value for the 2024 Tranche Year award of units was million, measured using performance targets at . Liability Classified Awards Certain PSUs are expected to be settled in cash and accordingly have been classified as liabilities within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The liability classified 2023 PSU awards for the 2024 Tranche Year were granted when the annual performance targets were set. The vesting requirements and vesting periods are identical to the equity classified awards described above. The Company recognizes expense related to these awards based on the fair value of the Common Stock shares, giving effect to the portion of services rendered during the requisite services period. As of September 30, 2024, there were nonvested underlying Common Stock RSUs and PSUs (after giving effect to estimated attainment levels of / for Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow PSUs, respectively) related to awards classified as liabilities.

 . Various countries have or are in the process of enacting legislation intended to implement the principles effective January 1, 2024. The Company s adoption of the OECD's global tax reform is not expected to have a material impact on its 2024 income tax expense. The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods on a federal, state, and foreign jurisdiction basis. The Company conducts its evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. motion picture and broader economy, among others. A valuation allowance is recorded against the Company s U.S. deferred tax assets and most of the Company s international deferred tax assets as the Company has determined the realization of these assets does not meet the more likely than not criteria. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects the impact of these valuation allowances against U.S. and international deferred tax assets generated during the period. The actual effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was ) . The Company s consolidated tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, foreign tax rate differences, federal and state tax credits, permanent differences and other discrete items.

On July 22, 2024, the Company issued Exchangeable Notes with conversion features that required bifurcation from the host instrument pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging. These conversion features were combined into a single derivative that comprises all features requiring bifurcation, see Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities for further information. The derivative features have been valued using a Binomial Lattice approach. The Binomial Lattice approach consists of simulated Common Stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Exchangeable Notes. The significant inputs used to value the derivative include the initial share price of the Common Stock, the volatility of the share price, time to maturity, risk-free interest rate, credit spread, and the discount yield. The estimated fair value of the derivative liability on July 22, 2024 was million. The Company measures the derivative at fair value at the end of each reporting period with any changes in fair value recorded to other expense (income) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Corporate borrowings Valuation Technique. Quoted market prices and observable market-based inputs were used to estimate fair value for Level 2 inputs. The Company valued these notes at principal value less an estimated discount reflecting a market yield to maturity. The Level 3 fair value measurement represents the transaction price of the corporate borrowings under market conditions. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities for further information.

The Company sold its interest in Saudi Arabia in January 2023. See Note 5 Investments for further information. Each segment s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, loyalty membership fees, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company changed the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to no longer further adjust for cash distributions from non-consolidated entities and other non-cash rent benefit. All comparative period information for Adjusted EBITDA has been re-cast to conform with the current definition.

Plaintiffs allege that GLAS and the Company breached the first lien/second lien intercreditor agreement dated July 31, 2020 (the Intercreditor Agreement by improperly transferring collateral that secured the Existing First Lien Notes free of such liens and eliminating the Existing First Lien Notes priority in certain other collateral in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. An unfavorable outcome, in which it is determined that the Company breached, as claimed, the Intercreditor Agreement, would permit note holders to claim an event of default occurred under the indenture governing the Existing First Lien Notes and, subject to any conditions in the indenture, permit note holders to accelerate the Existing First Lien Notes, which could in turn result in the acceleration of the Company s other outstanding debt. Such an event would thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on the market prices of our securities, including our Common Stock. We intend to vigorously defend against any claims made in the Noteholder Action.

Forward-Looking Statements In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as may, will, forecast, estimate, project, intend, plan, expect, should, believe and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions and speak only as of the date on which it is made. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements we make regarding future attendance levels, revenues and our liquidity. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those discussed in Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the risks and uncertainties relating to the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity, including following the termination of our senior secured revolving credit facility Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ), to fund operations, and satisfy obligations including cash outflows for deferred rent and planned capital expenditures currently and through the next twelve months. In order to achieve net positive cash flows provided by operating activities and long-term profitability, revenues will need to increase from current levels to levels at least in line with pre-COVID-19 revenues. However, there remain significant risks that may negatively impact revenues and attendance levels, including changes to movie studios release schedules (including as a result of production delays and delays to the release of movies caused by labor stoppages) and direct to streaming or other changing movie studio practices. If we are unable to achieve increased levels of attendance and revenues, we will be required to obtain additional liquidity. If such additional liquidity is not obtained or insufficient, we likely would seek an in-court or out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities, and in the event of such future liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of our Common Stock and other securities would likely suffer a total loss of their investment; the risks and uncertainties relating to the Refinancing Transactions, including, but not limited to, (i) the potential for additional future dilution of our Common Stock as a result of issuance of shares underlying our Exchangeable Notes, (ii) the possibility that the extension of certain debt maturities will not provide enough time for attendance and revenues to increase to sufficient levels and generate net positive cash flows from operating activities and long-term profitability to overcome liquidity concerns or may be

Overview AMC is the world s largest theatrical exhibition company and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. As of September 30, 2024, we operated theatres in 11 countries throughout the U.S. and Europe. Our theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and food and beverage sales. The balance of our revenues are generated from ancillary sources, including on-screen advertising, fees earned from our customer loyalty programs, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, theatrical distribution, retail popcorn sales, and online ticketing fees. As of September 30, 2024, we owned, operated or had interests in 874 theatres and 9,800 screens. Box Office Admissions and Film Content Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license theatrical films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are based on a share of admissions revenues and are accrued based on estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. These licenses typically state that rental fees are based on the box office performance of each film, though in certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement rate that is fixed. In some European territories, film rental fees are established on a weekly basis and some licenses use a per capita agreement instead of a revenue share, paying a flat amount per ticket. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor s films in any given year. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year based on the timing and popularity of film releases.

Critical Accounting Estimates For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the means by which we develop estimates therefore, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Material changes to our critical accounting estimates from what is described in our Form 10-K are described below: Derivative Liability . We remeasure the derivative liability related to the conversion features in our Exchangeable Notes at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. We have obtained independent third-party valuation studies to assist us in determining fair value. Our valuation studies use the Binomial Lattice approach and are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. The Binomial Lattice approach consists of simulated Common Stock prices from the valuation date to the maturity of the Exchangeable

Table of Contents 
 Notes. The significant inputs used to value the derivative include the initial share price of our Common Stock, the volatility of the share price, time to maturity, risk-free interest rate, credit spread, and the discount yield. The volatility of our Common Stock, the Common Stock price at the end of each reporting period, and the remaining amount of time until maturity of the Exchangeable Notes are key inputs for the estimation of fair value that are expected to change each reporting period. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded other income related to a decline in our derivative liability fair value of (73.5) million. We expect there will be future changes in fair value for our derivative liability and that the related amounts recorded as income or expense may be material. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities and Note 9 Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for further information.

On December 22, 2022, we entered into a forward purchase agreement (the Forward Purchase Agreement with Antara pursuant to which we agreed to (i) sell to Antara 10,659,511 AMC Preferred Equity Units for an aggregate purchase price of 75.1 million and (ii) simultaneously purchase from Antara 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company s 10 /12 Cash/PIK Toggle Second Lien Notes in exchange for 9,102,619 AMC Preferred Equity Units. On February 7, 2023, the Company issued 19,762,130 AMC Preferred Equity Units to Antara in exchange for 75.1 million in cash and 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company s 10 /12 Cash/PIK Toggle Second Lien Notes. The Company recorded 193.7 million to stockholders deficit as a result of the transaction. We paid 1.4 million of accrued interest in cash upon exchange of the notes. Share Issuances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we entered into various equity distribution agreements with sales agents to sell shares of our Common Stock and AMC Preferred Equity Units, from time to time, through at-the-market offering programs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we raised gross proceeds of approximately 440.0 million and paid fees to sales agents and incurred other third-party issuance costs of approximately 11.1 million and 9.2 million, respectively, through our at-the-market offering of approximately 7.1 million shares of AMC Preferred Equity Units and 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock.

On February 23, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved special awards in lieu of vesting of the 2022 PSU awards. The special awards were accounted for as a modification to the 2022 Tranche Year PSU awards which lowered the Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance targets such that 200 vesting was achieved for both tranches. This modification resulted in the immediate additional vesting of 238,959 Common Stock PSUs and 238,959 AMC Preferred Equity Unit PSUs. This was treated as a Type 3 modification (improbable-to-probable) which required the Company to recognize additional stock compensation expense based on the modification date fair values of the Common Stock PSUs and AMC Preferred Equity Units PSUs of 14.9 million and 5.3 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 20.2 million of additional stock compensation expense. Lease Termination. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received a 13.0 million buyout incentive from a landlord which provided the landlord the right to terminate the lease of one theatre. The incentive and termination gain resulted in a 16.7 million reduction to rent expense. NCM Bankruptcy. On April 11, 2023, National CineMedia, LLC NCM filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. NCM is the in-theatre advertising provider for the majority of the Company s theatres in the United States. Under the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, which became effective on August 7, 2023 (the Plan ), NCM has assumed its agreements with the Company. As part of the Plan, on August 7, 2023, NCM issued 16,581,829 common units NCM Common Units that were owed to the Company as part of the annual common unit adjustment. However, under the terms of the Plan and the restructuring of the equity of NCM thereunder, the NCM Common Units were immediately cancelled upon the effective date of the Plan. On August 13, 2023, in response to an appeal by the Company regarding certain terms of the Plan, including modification of the terms of the Exhibitor Services Agreement with other parties that were not similarly granted to the Company and appeal of the court s order to approve cancellation of the NCM Common Unit issuance, the United States District Court for the

 Southern District of Texas affirmed the rulings of the bankruptcy court, including confirmation of the Plan. The Company filed an appeal to these rulings with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and such appeal remains pending. The Company does not expect NCM s bankruptcy or the appeal to have a material impact on the Company. Shareholder Litigation. Two putative stockholder class actions were filed in the Delaware Chancery Court, and subsequently consolidated, which asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty against certain of our directors and a claim for breach of 8 Del. C . 242 against those directors and the Company, arising out of the creation of AMC Preferred Equity Units, the Antara Transactions and the Charter Amendments. This litigation prevented us from immediately implementing the Charter Amendments. On August 11, 2023, the court approved a settlement of the Shareholder Litigation, which, among other things, permitted the implementation of the Charter Amendments. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, record holders of Common Stock at the close of business on August 24, 2023, after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, but prior to the conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity Units into Common Stock, received a payment of one share of Common Stock for every 7.5 shares of Common Stock they owned. On August 28, 2023, the Company made the Settlement Payment and issued 6,897,018 shares of Common Stock. On October 13, 2023, a purported Company stockholder who objected to the settlement of the Shareholder Litigation filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision approving the settlement. On May 22, 2024, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the court s decision approving the settlement of the Shareholder Litigation.

 Segment Information Our historical results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, reflect the results of operations for our two theatrical exhibition reportable segments, U.S. markets and International markets. Results of Operations For the Three Months ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months ended September 30, 2023 Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues. Total revenues decreased 57.1 million, or 4.1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Admissions revenues decreased 53.5 million, or 6.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in attendance of 11.5 from 73.6 million patrons to 65.1 million patrons, partially offset by a 5.4 increase in average ticket price. In our U.S. markets our market share of box office revenues declined for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the interplay between the film slate and our geographic mix. In our International markets attendance declined due to the popularity of film product compared to the prior year. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to increased ticket prices for all formats, increases in 3D, other PLF and IMAX screen volumes as a percentage of attendance and increases in attendance for alternative content. Food and beverage revenues increased 7.7 million, or 1.6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in food and beverage per patron, partially offset by the decrease in attendance. Food and beverage per patron increased 14.8 from 6.56 to 7.53 due primarily to an increase in average prices and the percentage of guests making transactions, partially offset by lower units purchase per transaction and more frequent attendance from our AMC Stubs members. Total other theatre revenues decreased 11.3 million, or 9.0 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decline in attendance and a decline in the number of tickets purchased online subject to convenience fees, which resulted in lower ticket fee and advertising revenues. Operating costs and expenses. Operating costs and expenses decreased 29.5 million, or 2.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Film exhibition costs decreased 17.1 million, or 4.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in admissions revenues, partially offset by higher film rental terms. As a percentage of admissions revenues, film exhibition costs were 51.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 50.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in film exhibition cost percentage is primarily due to higher film rental terms in U.S. markets on top grossing films and alternative content during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Food and beverage costs decreased 0.4 million, or 0.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in food and beverage costs was primarily due to lower costs, partially offset by the increase in food and beverage revenues. As a percentage of food and beverage revenues, food and beverage costs were 18.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expense increased by 4.8 million, or 1.1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expense was primarily due to increases in equipment expense, premium format expense, and insurance, partially offset by decreases in utilities and advertising. As a percentage of revenues, operating expense was 33.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Rent expense decreased 3.5 , or 7.9 million, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Merger, acquisition, and other costs. Merger, acquisition, and other costs were 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Other. Other general and administrative expense decreased 0.4 million, or 0.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to declines in bonus expense as a result of lower-than-expected annual performance compared to annual targets in the current year compared to the prior year and lower stock-based compensation expense. See Note 7 Stockholders Deficit in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information about stock-based compensation expense. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 7.9 million, or 8.9 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to theatre closures and lower depreciation expense on theatres impaired during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Other income of 22.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to 73.5 million of income related to the decrease in fair value of the Conversion Option derivative liability, 21.5 million in foreign currency transaction gains, 14.9 million of recoveries related to the Shareholder Litigation, 5.2 million in equity in earnings related to non-consolidated entities, gain on extinguishment of debt of 1.3 million related to the redemption of 9.57 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026, and gain on extinguishment of debt of 0.5 million related to the redemption of 15.6 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 52.6 million related to the redemption of 613.65 million aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes and 41.0 million of third party costs related to the modification of the Existing Term Loans. Other income of 15.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to 15.3 million of income related to the settlement of the Shareholder Litigation comprised of 16.1 million of non-cash income for the decrease in estimated fair value as of the date of the final Delaware Supreme Court order of settlement shares issued to holders of Common Stock on August 28, 2023, partially offset by 0.8 million of contingent insurance recovery costs, gains on extinguishment of debt of 10.8 million related to the redemption of 24.2 million aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes, and equity earnings from non-consolidated entities of 3.1 million, partially offset by 12.8 million in foreign currency transaction losses. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the components of other expense (income). Interest expense. Interest expense increased 15.9 million to 119.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 103.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased interest expense of 18.0 million on the New Term Loans compared to the Existing Term Loans, and interest expense of 7.9 million on the Exchangeable Notes issued on July 22, 2024, partially offset by declines in interest expense of 9.0 million on the Second Lien Notes due to redemptions of principal balances and declines in interest expense related to the revolving credit facility of 1.0 million. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information about our indebtedness. Investment income. Investment income was 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income of 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Investment income in the current year includes interest income of 4.6 million and 0.3 million of increase in estimated fair value of our investment in common shares of Hycroft, partially offset by 1.7 million of decrease in estimated fair value of our investment in warrants to purchase common shares of Hycroft. Investment income in the prior year includes 3.7 million of interest income and 0.1 million of increase in our investment in common shares of Hycroft, partially offset by decline in estimated fair value of 0.8 million in our investment in warrants to purchase common shares of Hycroft. Income tax provision (benefit). The income tax benefit was (1.1) million, compared to a provision of 2.3 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. See Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for further information. Net earnings (loss). Net earnings (loss) was (20.7) million and 12.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by the decrease in attendance as a result of the decline in market share in U.S. markets and the popularity of new film releases in International markets compared to the prior year and an increase in interest expense, partially offset by decreases in rent expense, general and administrative expense, depreciation and amortization, increases in investment income, increases in other income and decreases in income tax provision.

Admissions revenues decreased 58.4 million, or 11.3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in attendance of 10.9 from 53.7 million patrons to 47.8 million patrons and a decrease in average ticket price of 0.5 . The decrease in attendance was primarily due to the popularity of film product compared to the prior year. Food and beverage revenues decreased 17.3 million, or 7.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in attendance, partially offset by an increase in food and beverage per patron. Food and beverage per patron increased 4.3 from 4.61 to 4.81 primarily due to an increase in average prices and the percentage of guests making transactions. Total other theatre revenues decreased 6.2 million, or 6.9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decline in attendance which resulted in lower ticket fees and advertising revenues. Operating costs and expenses. Operating costs and expenses decreased 37.9 million, or 4.4 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Film exhibition costs decreased 29.9 million, or 14.2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the decrease in attendance and lower film rental terms. As a percentage of admissions revenues, film exhibition costs were 39.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in film exhibition cost percentage is primarily due to the concentration of box office revenues in higher grossing films in the prior year, which typically results in higher film exhibition costs. Food and beverage costs decreased 5.2 million, or 8.4 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in food and beverage costs was primarily due to the decrease in food and beverage revenues. As a percentage of food and beverage revenues, food and beverage costs were 24.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 25.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating expense decreased by 2.7 million, or 0.9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expense was primarily due to lower utilities expense and the decrease in attendance. As a percentage of revenues, operating expense was 40.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 36.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Rent expense increased 2.7 , or 4.5 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Other. Other general and administrative expense increased 1.7 million, or 3.2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 6.2 million, or 10.3 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to theatre closures and lower depreciation expense on theatres impaired during the year ended December 31, 2023. Other income. Other income of 55.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to the favorable settlement of a vendor dispute of 36.2 million, and foreign currency transaction gains of 19.0 million. Other income of 4.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to 3.2 million in foreign currency transaction gains. See Note 1 Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the components of other expense (income). Interest expense. Interest expense increased by 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for additional information about our indebtedness.

 Investment income. Investment income was 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Investment income in the current year includes 1.4 million of interest income. Investment income in the prior year includes a gain on sale of our 10.0 interest in Saudi Cinema Company, LLC of (15.5) million and interest income of (0.6) million. Income tax provision. The income tax provision was 2.1 million and 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. See Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for further information. Net loss. Net loss was 50.6 million and 43.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was negatively impacted by the decrease in attendance as a result of the popularity of new film releases compared to the prior year, increases in rent expense, increases in general and administrative expenses, increases in interest expense and decreases in investment income, partially offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization expense, increases in other income and decreases in income tax provision. Adjusted EBITDA We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision (benefit), (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in International markets. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The preceding definition of and adjustments made to GAAP measures to determine Adjusted EBITDA are broadly consistent with Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Company s debt indentures. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company changed the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to no longer further adjust for cash distributions from non-consolidated entities and other non-cash rent benefit. All comparative period information for Adjusted EBITDA has been re-cast to conform with the current definition. The following tables set forth our Adjusted EBITDA by reportable operating segment and our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA:

 (1) For information regarding the income tax provision, see Note 8 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. (2) Amounts represent preopening expense related to temporarily closed screens under renovation, theatre and other closure expense for the permanent closure of screens, including the related accretion of interest, disposition of assets and other non-operating gains or losses included in operating expenses. We have excluded these items as they are non-cash in nature or are non-operating in nature. (3) Equity in earnings of non-consolidated entities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of equity in earnings from AC JV of (4.3) million. Equity in earnings of non-consolidated entities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of equity in earnings from AC JV of (1.5) million. 
 Equity in earnings of non-consolidated entities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of equity in earnings from AC JV of (9.5) million. Equity in earnings of non-consolidated entities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of equity in earnings from AC JV of (3.4) million. (4) Attributable EBITDA includes the EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operators in certain International markets. See below for a reconciliation of our equity in loss of non-consolidated entities to attributable EBITDA. Because these equity investments are in theatre operators in regions where we hold a significant market share, we believe attributable EBITDA is more indicative of the performance of these equity investments and management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate these equity investments. We also provide services to these theatre operators including information technology systems, certain on-screen advertising services and our gift card and package ticket program.

 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have included Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides management and investors with additional information to measure our performance and estimate our value.

 Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: does not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; does not reflect the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; excludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; and does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. markets was 143.3 million compared to 155.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a decrease in attendance partially due to a decline in market share of box office revenues compared to the prior year driven by the interplay between the film slate and our geographic mix, increases in film exhibition cost as a percentage of admissions revenue, and increases in operating expenses. These declines were partially offset by increases in average ticket price, increases in food and beverage sales per patron, decreases in rent expense and decreases in general and administrative expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA in the International markets was 18.5 million compared to 44.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a decrease in attendance as a result of the popularity of new film releases compared to the prior year and declines in average ticket price. These declines were partially offset by increases in food and beverage sales per patron and decreases in rent expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. markets and International markets was 161.8 million compared to 199.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the aforementioned factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. markets was 178.5 million compared to 353.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a decrease in attendance as a result of the availability and popularity of new film releases compared to the prior year and increases in rent expense due to a prior year rent credit for a theatre termination. These declines were partially offset by increases in average ticket price, increases in food and beverage sales per patron and decreases in general and administrative expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA in the International markets was 0.6 million compared to 53.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a decrease in attendance as a result of the popularity of new film releases compared to the prior year, declines in average ticket price and increases in rent expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. markets and International markets was 179.1 million compared to 406.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by the aforementioned factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our consolidated revenues are primarily collected in cash, principally through admissions and food and beverage sales. We have an operating float which partially finances our operations and which generally permits us to maintain a smaller amount of working capital capacity. This float exists because admissions revenues are received in cash, while exhibition costs (primarily film rentals) are ordinarily paid to distributors 20 to 45 days following receipt of admissions revenues. Film distributors generally release the films which they anticipate will be the most successful during the summer and year-end holiday seasons. Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during such periods and experience higher working capital requirements following such periods. We had working capital deficit (excluding restricted cash) as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 of 839.5) million and (456.4) million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, working capital included operating lease liabilities of 527.6 million and 508.8 million, respectively, and deferred revenues of 385.1 million and 421.8 million, respectively. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our Financial Covenants.

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 527.4 million. We have continued to lower the future interest expense of our fixed-rate debt through debt buybacks and exchanges for equity and enhanced liquidity through equity issuances. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities, Note 7 Stockholders Deficit, and Note 13 Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for further information. We expect, from time to time, to continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material and, to the extent equity is used, dilutive. Refinancing Transactions On July 22, 2024, we completed a series of refinancing transactions (the Refinancing Transactions with two creditor groups to refinance and extend to 2029 and 2030 the maturities of approximately 1.6 billion of our debt previously maturing in 2026. On August 1, 2024, we completed follow-on open market repurchases of our Existing Term Loans, and in exchange, issued to such selling holders our New Term Loans pursuant to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement of approximately 762.0 million. On August 14, 2024, we completed an additional follow-on open market repurchase of our Existing Term Loans, and in exchange, issued to such selling holders our New Term Loans pursuant to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement of approximately 4.0 million. On September 17, 2024, we issued 27.0 million of New Term Loans at par for cash and used the proceeds to redeem the remaining Existing Term Loans. As of September 30, 2024, the Company completed open market purchases of 1,895.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Existing Term Loans and issued 2,024.3 million aggregate principal amount of the New Term Loans. Accordingly, as of such date, the Company had no remaining aggregate principal amount of Existing Term Loans outstanding. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for further information. Liquidity Requirements We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and satisfy our obligations currently and through the next twelve months. Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable long-term. In order to achieve sustainable net positive cash flows provided by operating activities and long-term profitability, we believe that revenues will need to increase to levels at least in line with pre-COVID-19 revenues. North American box office grosses were down approximately 25 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Until such time as we are able to achieve sustainable net positive cash flows provided by operating activities, it is difficult to estimate our future cash burn rates and liquidity requirements. Depending on our assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve levels of revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. There can be no assurance that the revenues, attendance levels and other assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements and future cash burn rates will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to limited ability to predict studio film release dates, the overall production and theatrical release levels and success of individual titles. Additionally, the effects of labor stoppages that occurred during 2023 had a negative impact in 2024 on the film slate for exhibition, the Company s liquidity and cash burn rates. Further, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet our obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report on terms acceptable to us or at all. On March 28, 2024, we entered into a Common Stock equity distribution agreement with certain sales agents to sell shares of Common Stock, from time to time, having an aggregate offering price of 250.0 million, through an at-the-market offering program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we raised gross proceeds of 250.0 

 62 

Table of Contents 
 million and paid fees to sales agents and incurred other third-party issuance costs of approximately 6.3 million and 0.6 million, respectively, through the at-the-market offering of approximately 72.5 million shares of Common Stock. We paid 0.7 million of other third-party issuance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We intend to use any net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to the program to bolster liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase our existing indebtedness (including expenses, accrued interest and premium, if any) and for general corporate purposes. As of April 19, 2024, and in anticipation of the maturity of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, we voluntarily terminated the commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility in full and paid off any remaining obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. We currently do not expect to replace the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. We have entered into a new letter of credit facility in order to continue to provide letters of credit in the ordinary course of business following the termination of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash flows used in operating activities, as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, were 254.4 million and 137.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash flows used in operating activities was primarily due to the decline in attendance due to the impact of labor stoppages that occurred during 2023 and third-party fees paid in connection with the modification of the term loans. All things being equal, a decline in attendance results in less cash inflows provided by operating activities that could be used to pay for the costs associated with our operations, thus creating an increase in net cash used in operations. The additional cash used in operating activities due to the decline in attendance was partially offset by reductions in rent repayments that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic and vendor dispute and other settlement proceeds received during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities, as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, were 154.0 million and 116.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Cash outflows from investing activities include capital expenditures of 155.8 million and 153.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash flows used in investing activities included proceeds from the sale of our investment in Saudi Cinema Company, LLC of 30.0 million and proceeds from the disposition of long-term assets of 8.6 million. We fund the costs of constructing, maintaining, and remodeling our theatres through existing cash balances, cash generated from operations, landlord contributions, or capital raised, as necessary. We generally lease our theatres pursuant to long-term non-cancelable operating leases, which may require the developer, who owns the property, to reimburse us for the construction costs. We estimate that our capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions, will be approximately 175 million to 225 million for year ended December 31, 2024, to maintain and enhance operations. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows provided by financing activities, as reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, were 72.1 million and 355.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to net proceeds from equity issuances of 243.0 million and proceeds from the issuance of New Term Loans of 27.0 million, partially offset by the repurchase of Second Lien Notes of 83.2 million, deferred debt issuance costs of 45.7 million, principal payments under Existing Term Loans of 27.0 million, the repurchase of Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 of 12.9 million, the repurchase of Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 of 6.0 million, principal payments under term loan borrowings of 15.1 million, and taxes paid for restricted unit withholdings of 2.2 million. See Note 6 Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities and Note 7 Stockholders Equity in the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q for further information, including a summary of principal payments required and maturities of corporate borrowings as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to net proceeds from equity issuances of 492.4 million, net of issuance costs, partially offset by the repurchase of Second Lien Notes for 99.8 million, and taxes paid for restricted unit withholdings of 14.2 million. Formation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries On July 22, 2024, American-Multi Cinema Inc. Multi-Cinema ), a Missouri corporation and a direct subsidiary of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. Holdings ), assigned or transferred the net assets Theatre Net Assets of 175 theatres and transferred a 100 interest in certain intellectual property assets to its direct subsidiary Centertainment Development, LLC Centertainment ), and the Theatre Net Assets were in turn transferred to Centertainment s direct wholly-owned subsidiary Muvico, LLC Muvico ), a newly formed Texas limited liability company. Theatre Net Assets include lease contracts and theatre property, including furniture, fixtures, plant and equipment, and other working capital items associated directly with the theatre locations. At the same time, Muvico licensed the intellectual property back to Multi-Cinema for its continued use in the operation of its retained theatres and entered into a management agreement for Multi-Cinema to operate the theatres transferred to Muvico. Muvico and Centertainment (collectively, the Muvico Group are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing Holdings Existing First Lien Notes. Unrestricted Subsidiaries Financial Information and Operating Metrics Pursuant to the indenture governing Holdings Existing First Lien Notes, the indenture governing Muvico s Exchangeable Notes, and the New Term Loan Credit Agreement governing Holdings and Muvico s New Term Loans, we are presenting the following financial information and operating metrics for the Muvico Group separately from Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries (the Restricted Subsidiaries and collectively with Holdings, the AMC Group ). AMC Theatres of UK Limited, which is an unrestricted subsidiary under the indenture governing Holdings Existing First Lien Notes has been included with the Restricted Subsidiaries for the purposes of the following presentation of financial information and operating metrics (this subsidiary is individually immaterial). The financial information presented for AMC Group and Muvico Group is presented on a standalone basis with discrete identification of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses associated with the Theatre Net Assets that were transferred to Muvico. Intercompany transactions between entities within the AMC Group or within the Muvico Group have been eliminated. Certain entities within the AMC Group and within the Muvico Group are parties to intercompany management, licensing, and debt agreements with each other. These transactions are reflected discretely within the columnar presentation below and are properly eliminated upon consolidation. The financial information is also prepared using the historical cost carrying values of Holdings, the top parent entity. Holdings and Muvico are co-borrowers and joint and severally liable for the New Term Loan borrowings. Pursuant to ASC 405-40 we have allocated fifty percent (50 of the liabilities, interest expense and cash flows each to Muvico and Holdings, respectively. The basis of this allocation is the amount we expect each party to pay.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the ordinary course of business, our financial results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In accordance with applicable guidance, we presented a sensitivity analysis showing the potential impact to net income of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our analysis utilized a hypothetical 100 basis-point increase or decrease to the average interest rate on our variable rate debt instruments to illustrate the potential impact to interest expense of changes in interest rates and a hypothetical 100 basis-point increase or decrease to market interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments to illustrate the potential impact to fair value of changes in interest rates. Similarly, for the same period, our analysis used a uniform and hypothetical 10 increase in foreign currency translation rates to depict the potential impact to net income of changes in foreign exchange rates. These market risk instruments and the potential impacts to the condensed consolidated statements of operations are presented below. Market risk on variable-rate financial instruments. As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 2,019.3 million outstanding principal amount of our New Term Loans which bear interest, at our option, at rates equal to either (i) a base rate plus a margin of between 500 and 600 basis points depending on the total leverage ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the Total Leverage Ratio or (ii) Term SOFR plus a margin of between 600 and 700 basis points depending on the Total Leverage Ratio. Until the delivery under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement of the financial statements for the first full fiscal quarter ending after the Closing Date, the New Term Loans bear interest, at the option of the Company, at either (a) the base rate plus a margin of 600 basis points or (b) Term SOFR plus a margin of 700 basis points. Prior to the Refinancing Transactions we had outstanding Existing Term Loans under the Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2013 as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified which bore interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50 per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate announced by the administrative agent and (c) 1.00 per annum plus Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined below) for a 1-month tenor or (2) Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.11448 per annum, 0.26161 per annum, and 0.42826 per annum for interest periods of one-month, three-months, or six-months or longer, respectively Adjusted Term SOFR plus in the case of the Existing Term Loans, 2.0 for base rate loans or 3.0 for SOFR loans. The rate in effect for the outstanding New Term Loans was 11.919 per annum at September 30, 2024, and 8.427 per annum for the Existing Term Loans at September 30, 2023. Increases in market interest rates would cause interest expense to increase and earnings before income taxes to decrease. The change in interest expense and earnings before income taxes would be dependent upon the weighted average outstanding borrowings during the reporting period following an increase in market interest rates. A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have increased or decreased interest expense on the Existing Term Loans and New Term Loans by approximately 14.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2023, we had an aggregate principal balance of 1,910.0 million outstanding under the Existing Term Loans. A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have increased or decreased interest expense on our Existing Term Loans by 14.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Market risk on fixed-rate financial instruments . Included in corporate borrowings as of September 30, 

 73

 2024, were principal amounts of 414.4 million of our Exchangeable Notes, 950.0 million of our Existing First Lien Notes, 163.9 million of our Second Lien Notes, 400.0 million of our 12.75 Odeon Senior Secured Notes due 2027 Odeon Notes due 2027 ), 82.7 million of our 5.75 Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 Notes due 2025 ), 41.9 million of our 5.875 Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 Notes due 2026 ), 125.5 million of our 6.125 Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027 Notes due 2027 ), and 4.0 million 5.3 million) of our 6.375 Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 Sterling Notes due 2024 ). A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have caused an increase or (decrease) in the fair value of our fixed rate financial instruments of approximately 65.4 million and (62.6) million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. Included in corporate borrowings as of September 30, 2023, were principal amounts of 950.0 million of our Existing First Lien Notes, 1,124.2 million of our Second Lien Notes, 400.0 million of our Odeon Notes due 2027, 98.3 million of our Notes due 2025, 51.5 million of our Notes due 2026, 125.5 million of our Notes due 2027, and 4.0 million 4.9 million) of our Sterling Notes due 2024. A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have caused an increase or (decrease) in the fair value of our fixed rate financial instruments of approximately 60.1 million and (57.7) million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. Foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising from our International markets operations. International markets revenues and operating expenses are transacted in British Pounds, Euros, Swedish Krona, and Norwegian Krone. U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency. If any international subsidiary was to operate in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP would require that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency. Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments. Based upon the functional currencies in the International markets as of September 30, 2024, holding everything else constant, a hypothetical 10 increase in foreign currency translation rates to depict the potential impact to net loss of changes in foreign exchange rates would increase the aggregate net loss of our International theatres for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, by approximately 5.1 million. Based upon the functional currencies in the International markets as of September 30, 2023, holding everything else constant, a hypothetical 10 increase in foreign currency translation rates to depict the potential impact to net loss of changes in foreign exchange rates would increase the aggregate net loss of our International theatres for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, by approximately 4.4 million. Our foreign currency translation rates increased by approximately 1.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

From January 1, 2020 through November 5, 2024, the outstanding shares of our Common Stock have increased by 370,471,691 shares (on a Reverse Stock Split adjusted basis) in a combination of at-the-market sales, conversion of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, shareholder litigation settlement, conversion of Class B common stock, conversion of notes, exchanges of notes, transaction fee payments, and equity grant vesting. On March 14, 2023, the Company held the Special Meeting and obtained the requisite stockholder approval for the Charter Amendments (as defined in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023) and on August 14, 2023 we filed the amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation implementing the Charter Amendments effective as of August 24, 2023. In accordance with the Charter Amendments, we increased the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 524,173,073 to 550,000,000 shares of Common Stock and effectuated a reverse stock split at a ratio of one share of Common Stock for every ten shares of Common Stock outstanding. In accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designations governing the Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, following the effectiveness of the Charter Amendments all outstanding shares of our Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock converted into 99,540,642 shares of Common Stock. On July 22, 2024, as part of the Refinancing Transactions, Muvico issued the Exchangeable Notes and the Additional Exchangeable Notes that are exchangeable into our Common Stock pursuant to the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes. If the Exchangeable Notes and the Additional Exchangeable Notes are converted fully into shares of our Common Stock, they will be converted into an aggregate of up to 92,584,105 shares of Common Stock, which represents the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Exchangeable Notes, including a make-whole fee, determined as if the Additional Notes had been purchased by the holders of the Exchangeable Notes, and the outstanding Exchangeable Notes were converted in full as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of this report, without regard to any limitations on the conversion therein. If the Exchangeable Notes and Additional Exchangeable Notes are converted fully into shares of our Common Stock prior to maturity, without regard to any limitations on the conversion therein, the maximum number of the Additional Exchangeable Notes are issued, and Muvico elects to pay interest by issuing PIK Notes during the life of the Exchangeable Notes, they will be converted into an aggregate of up to 129,051,873 shares of Common Stock representing the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion therein. As of November 5, 2024, there were 375,679,699 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. We expect to issue additional shares of Common Stock to raise cash to bolster our liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or refinance indebtedness (including expenses, accrued interest and premium, if any), for working capital, to finance strategic initiatives and future acquisitions, to settle conversion of the Exchangeable Notes, including any PIK Notes and Additional Exchangeable Notes, or for other purposes. We may also issue preferred equity securities or securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of Common Stock or acquire interests in other companies, or other assets by using a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, or just shares of Common Stock. The holders of the Exchangeable Notes may from time to time convert the Exchangeable Notes and Additional Exchangeable Notes into shares of our Common Stock, and Muvico may elect to pay interest-in-kind by issuing PIK

 Notes. Additionally, vesting of outstanding awards pursuant to our current and legacy equity compensation programs results in the issuance of new shares of Common Stock, net of any shares withheld to cover tax withholding obligations upon vesting. Any of these events may significantly dilute the ownership interests of current stockholders, reduce our earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of our shares of Common Stock. The market price and trading volume of our shares of Common Stock have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Common Stock to incur substantial losses. The market prices and trading volume of our shares of Common Stock have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Common Stock to incur substantial losses. For example, during 2023 and 2024 to date, as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split, the market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE of 2.38 per share on April 16, 2024 to an intra-day high on the NYSE of 85.30 on February 28, 2023. The last reported sale price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on November 5, 2024, was 4.39 per share. During 2023 and 2024 to date, daily trading volume ranged from approximately 771,720 to 634,246,600 shares. We believe that volatility and market prices of our shares may reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. Extreme fluctuations in the market price of our Common Stock have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The market volatility and trading patterns we have experienced create several risks for investors, including the following: 
 the market prices of our Common Stock have experienced and may continue to experience rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or macro or industry fundamentals, and substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties that we continue to face; factors in the public trading market for our Common Stock may include the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums), the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our Common Stock and any related hedging and other trading factors; our market capitalization, as implied by various trading prices, currently reflects valuations that diverge significantly from historical valuations, and to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, purchasers of our Common Stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices; to the extent volatility in our Common Stock is caused, or may from time to time be caused, as has widely been reported, by a short squeeze in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our Common Stock as traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses, investors purchase at inflated prices unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated; and if the market prices of our Common Stock declines, investors may be unable to resell shares of our Common Stock at or above the price at which their investment was made. Our Common Stock may continue to fluctuate or decline significantly in the future, which may result in substantial losses. 
 The market price of our Common Stock could also be negatively affected by any unfavorable outcome in the Noteholder Action described in Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q or by any other action brought by note holders resulting from the Refinancing Transactions. If it is determined that the Company breached, as claimed, the Intercreditor Agreement, this would permit note holders to claim an event of default occurred under the indenture governing the Existing First Lien Notes and, subject to any conditions in the indenture, permit note holders to accelerate the Existing First Lien Notes, which could in turn result in the acceleration of the Company s other outstanding debt. Such an event would thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and on the market prices of our securities, including our Common Stock. Additional litigation brought by the note holders, any additional claimed defaults under the indenture or any publicity in connection therewith could also negatively affect the market price of our Common Stock.

 Future increases or decreases in the market of our Common Stock may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting us. Accordingly, the market price of our shares of Common Stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business. Overall, there are various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our Common Stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Common Stock, including: 
 actual or anticipated variations in our annual or quarterly results of operations, including our earnings estimates and whether we meet market expectations with regard to our earnings; restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or other distributions; publication of research reports by analysts or others about us or the motion picture exhibition industry, which may be unfavorable, inaccurate, inconsistent or not disseminated on a regular basis; changes in market interest rates that may cause purchasers of our shares to demand a different yield; changes in market valuations of similar companies; market reaction to any additional equity, debt or other securities that we may issue in the future, and which may or may not dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders; additions or departures of key personnel; actions by institutional or significant stockholders; short interest in our securities and the market response to such short interest; the dramatic increase or decrease in the number of individual holders of our Common Stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing; speculation in the press or investment community about our company or industry; strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or other investments; legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting our business or our industry, including positions taken by the Internal Revenue Service IRS strategic actions taken by motion picture studios, such as the shuffling of film release dates; investigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us; the occurrence of any of the other risk factors included or incorporated by reference in our Annual Report; and general market and economic conditions. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds Except as previously disclosed, there were no sales of unregistered securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and except as previously disclosed between October 7, 2024 and October 9, 2024, the Company entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements to extinguish unsecured debt, under which it issued an aggregate of 3,226,443 shares of Common Stock in exchange for 12,476,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.75 subordinated notes due 2025. Pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, the Common Stock were issued in each case to existing security holders of the Company exclusively in exchange for such holders securities and no commission or other remuneration was paid or given for soliciting the exchange. Other exemptions may apply. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None.
