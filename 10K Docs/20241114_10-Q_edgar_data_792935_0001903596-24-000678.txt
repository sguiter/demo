and
 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Management believes that these receivables are properly stated
and are not likely to be settled for a significantly different amount. 

The
Company s revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that
reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. The Company derives its revenues from
the sale of its services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to
be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its revenue transactions: 

i. 
 identify the
 contract with a customer; 

ii. 
 identify the
 performance obligations in the contract; 

iii. 
 determine the
 transaction price; 

iv. 
 allocate the
 transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

v. 
 recognize revenue
 as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

million,
and an accumulated deficit of approximately million. The Company is dependent upon the raising of additional capital to implement
its business plan. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure
such financing may have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition. In the opinion of management, liquidity
risk is assessed as high, material and remains unchanged from the prior year. 

iii. 
 Market
 risk 

Market
risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises of three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, and other price risk. The Company is exposed to interest
rate risk. 

a. 
 Interest rate risk 

Interest
rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its convertible debt, short term loans, third party loans and government
assistance loans as of September 30, 2024. In the opinion of management, interest rate risk is assessed as moderate. 

b. 
 Currency
 risk 

Currency
risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange
rates. The Company has minimal exposure to certain foreign currency payables and loans. 

c. 
 Other
 price risk 

Other
price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether
those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial
instruments traded in the market. In the opinion of management, the Company is not exposed to this risk and remains unchanged from the
prior year. 

million,
and total liabilities in excess of assets in the amount of million. Management believes that current available resources will
not be sufficient to fund the Company s planned expenditures over the next 12 months. These factors, individually and collectively
indicate that a material uncertainty exists that raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern
for one year from the date of issuance of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of common shares, and/or debt financing in order to
implement its business plan and generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. If the Company raises additional capital through the
issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have
rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional
funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If
the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish
its rights to certain geographical areas, or techniques that it might otherwise seek to retain. There is no assurance that the Company
will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on the
Company s financial condition. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the
amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The
Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis during the last month of each year and at an interim date if indications
of impairment exist. Intangible asset impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount with an
impairment being recognized only when the fair value is less than carrying value and the impairment is deemed to be permanent in nature. 

The Company recorded in amortization expense for finite-lived assets for each of the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 and for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 NOTES
TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

On
May 1, 2024 the Company, through its subsidiary Evernia Health Center LLC, entered into a Definitive Agreement whereby the Company would
assume the lease for suites 100,101, 201, 202 and 203 located at 899 Meadows Road, Boca Raton, Florida (the Leased Premises and the furniture, fixtures and equipment located therein, upon the assignment of the lease from the property owner. The lease was assigned
on June 10, 2024 and the Company entered into a Bill of Sale to give effect to the Definitive Agreement. 

The
purchase price was 240,000 which was settled by a deposit of 20,000 and a cash payment of 220,000 and the payment to the Seller of
 83,393 for the assumption of the security deposit held by the landlord of the Leased Premises located at 899 Meadows Road. 

The
assigned lease has a remaining term of 3 years, expiring on June 30, 2027, with an initial monthly lease cost of 21,843 from July 1,
2024 to December 31, 2024, escalating by 2.9 per annum, each annual period being a calendar year. 

To
determine the present value of minimum future lease payments for operating leases at June 10, 2024, the Company was required to estimate
a rate of interest that it would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment
(the "incremental borrowing rate" or "IBR"). 

The
Company determined the appropriate IBR by identifying a reference rate and making adjustments that take into consideration financing
options and certain lease-specific circumstances. For the reference rate, the Company used the Bank rate 3/1 adjustable-rate mortgage
which represents the average rate for several mortgage lenders in the market of 6.36 . The Company determined that 6.36 per annum
was an appropriate incremental borrowing rate to apply to its real estate operating lease. 

The
present value of the future minimum lease payments was valued at 744,256 on June 10, 2024.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations
for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the
notes presented herein and the consolidated financial statements and the other information set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2024. In addition to historical information,
the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. 

Plan
of Operation 

During
the next twelve months, we plan
to continue to grow the Evernia business organically or through acquisitions, should any opportunities present themselves. 

Edgewater
Recovery Centers, LLC 

As mentioned in Note 19 to the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements, we finalized the execution of a letter of intent and a management agreement with respect to the assets
and operations of Edgewater Recovery Center LLC of Morehead Kentucky, and on October 22, we signed a binding Asset Purchase Agreement
("APA") to purchase the business operations and operational assets, excluding any real property of Edgewater Recovery Center,
LLC ("ETC") headquartered in Morehead Kentucky. ETC operates primarily in the urban areas of Morehead in
eastern Kentucky and Paducah in western Kentucky. 

ETC has been managed by us since July 15, 2024 and
will continue to be managed until such time as our newly created, wholly owned subsidiary, ARIA Kentucky, LLC ("ARIA Kentucky")
is fully licensed, accredited and contracted with the managed care organizations, whereupon the operations of ETC will cease. ETC will
continue to generate revenues from servicing clients during the transition period. The existing interim management of ETC will be continued
by ARIA Kentucky and all operations will be conducted under the Addiction Recovery Institute of America ("ARIA") Brand. 

The current ETC patient census in Kentucky is
approximately 195 patients which we believe, that with the conclusion of the binding APA, will increase dramatically in the near term.
The Ethema management team has stabilized the ETC operations over the last three months and is cash flow positive. we intend to add another
16 beds in October at the Paducah location, which has been operating at full capacity, increasing revenue in this underserved
market. 

ETC and after the closing of the transaction, ARIA
Kentucky, primarily provides care to Medicaid insured clients. There is currently on-going investigations into other Medicaid providers
in Kentucky, which, we believe, will reduce the number of patients served by these providers, presenting ARIA Kentucky with an opportunity
to further expand its footprint and revenue potential in Kentucky. 

Results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Revenues 

 Revenues were 1,760,000 and 1,353,899 for the three

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing the realized exchange gains and (losses) on monetary
assets and liabilities settled during the current year as well as mark to market adjustments on monetary assets and liabilities reflected
on the balance sheet and denominated in Canadian Dollars. 

Net (loss) income before income taxes 

 Net loss before income taxes was (1,840,192) and
net income before income taxes was 1,478,558 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 3,318,750
or 224.5 . The increase is primarily due to the increase in the operating loss, the prior year gain on sale of property, offset by the
prior year loss on debt extinguishment, and the prior year extension fee paid on the property purchase, all discussed in detail above. 

Income taxes 

 Income taxes was 0 and a Tax credit was (221,107)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a decrease of 221,107 or 100.0 . We have sufficient net operating losses to offset
any taxable income during the current period, the prior year income tax credit related to a deferred tax credit on intangible assets and
the reversal of prior year tax provisions upon filing prior period tax returns. 

Net (loss) income 

 Net (loss) income was (1,840,192) and 1,699,665
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 3,539,857 or 208.3 . The increase is primarily due
to the increase in net loss before taxes offset by the taxation credit, as discussed above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
have prepared our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP applicable to a going concern, which
assumes that we will be able to meet our obligations and continue our operations in the normal course of business. At September 30, 2024
we had a working capital deficiency of 7.1 million, and total liabilities in excess of assets in the amount of 7.1 million.
We believe that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures over the next 12 months. These factors,
individually and collectively indicate that a material uncertainty exists that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern for one year from the date of issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 

We
are dependent on the raising additional capital through placement of common shares, and/or debt financing in order to implement our business
plan and generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or
securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject
to limitations on our operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If we obtain additional funds through arrangements with
collaborators or strategic partners, we may be required to relinquish our rights to certain geographical areas, or techniques that we
might otherwise seek to retain. There is no assurance that we will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to
secure such financing may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Cash
used in operating activities was 377,954 and 575,790 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease
of 197,836. The decrease is primarily due to the following: 

An increase in net loss of 3,539,857, discussed under operations above. 

An increase in the movement of non-cash items of 2,607,477 primarily due to the movement in the gain on disposal of property of 2,484,172, and the movement in on-cash management fees accrued of 480,000, offset by the movement in loss on debt extinguishment of 277,175. 

The movement in working capital increased by 1,130,216, primarily due to the increase in the movements in accounts receivable of 352,368 accounts payable of 238,948, operating lease liabilities of 262,298 and taxes payable of 237,211. 

Cash
provided by (used in) financing activities was 1,415,265 and (2,099,676) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In the current period we received 1,912,000 and repaid (801,323) of short-term notes and received 542,000 and repaid 378,688 from
receivables funding, in addition we received a term advance of 250,000 from a related party of which 11,538 was repaid. We also repaid
 40,000 of the 475,000 promissory note issued on the acquisition of the minority interest in ATHI. In the prior period we repaid convertible
notes of 1,124,442, repaid promissory notes of 568,325, third party loans of 361,260 and net repayment of receivables funding of 267,771,
primarily out of the net proceeds of the property disposal, offset by proceeds received on convertible notes of 150,000 and proceeds
from promissory notes of 223,500. 

Over
the next twelve months we estimate that we will require approximately 3.5 million for working capital and to repay existing short-term
notes as the business continues to develop its rehab business in the US market. We have convertible notes, short term loans and promissory
notes which will mature or have already matured during the current year and may have to raise equity or secure debt. There is no assurance
that we will be successful with future financing ventures, and the inability to secure such financing may have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition. In the opinion of management, our liquidity risk is assessed as high due to this uncertainty. 

We
have prepared our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP applicable to a going concern, which
assumes that we will be able to meet our obligations and continue our operations in the normal course of business. At September 30, 2024
we had a working capital deficiency of 7.1 million, and total liabilities in excess of assets in the amount of 7.1 million.
We believe that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures over the next 12 months. These factors,
individually and collectively indicate that a material uncertainty exists that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern for one year from the date of issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

 The
recent Accounting Pronouncements are fully disclosed in note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have an effect on the
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Off
balance sheet arrangements 

 We
do not maintain off-balance sheet arrangements nor do we participate in non-exchange traded contracts requiring fair value accounting
treatment. 

Inflation 

 The
effect of inflation on our revenue and operating results was not significant. 

Climate
Change 

 We
believe that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material
effect on our operations. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

 We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item . 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

 Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)
under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 are not effective due to a lack of written policies and procedures
to address all material transactions and developments impacting our financial statements. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

 There has been no change
in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during
our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Our management is committed to improving our controls and procedures by, among other matters,
continuing to consider and adopt appropriate policies and procedures to address all material transactions and developments impacting our
financial statements. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control processes,
even if improved, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of error or fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that the breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system
of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. However, these inherent limitations
are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
not eliminate, this risk.

PART
II 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.

self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries
or of our companies or our subsidiaries officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could
have a material adverse effect.
