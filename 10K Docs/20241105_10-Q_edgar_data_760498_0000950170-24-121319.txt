The Company has the ability and intent to hold the debt securities classified as held for investment until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the debt securities. Furthermore, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company also had the ability and intent to hold the debt securities classified as available for sale for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying debt securities were purchased. The fair value of those debt securities having unrealized losses is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date, or if market yields for such investments decline. The Company has no intent or requirement to sell before the recovery of the unrealized loss; therefore, no impairment loss was realized in the Company s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

(1) Excludes accrued interest receivable of million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, that is recorded in accrued interest receivable and other assets. 

The C ompany's loans are currently held by BancFirst and held by Pegasus and Worthington. In addition, approximately of the Company's loans are secured by real estate. Credit risk on loans is managed through limits on amounts loaned to individual and related borrowers, underwriting standards and loan monitoring procedures. The amounts and types of collateral obtained, if any, to secure loans are based upon the Company s underwriting standards and management s credit evaluation. Collateral varies, but may include real estate, equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, livestock and/or securities. The Company s interest in collateral is secured through filing mortgages and liens, or by possession of the collateral. The Company's portfolio segment descriptions and the weighted average remaining life of portfolio segments are disclosed in Note (5) to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets and Loan Modifications 

As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other real estate owned included a commercial real estate property recorded at approximately million and m illion, respectively. The increase in OREO and this commercial real estate property was primarily due to tenant improvements associated with new and renewing leases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Rental income for this property is included in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Operating expense for this property is included in net expense from other real estate owned in noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Operating expense 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company sold property held in other real estate owned for a total gain of million, compared to a total gain of in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

million compared to million during the year ended December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans The Company did t recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans for either the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. In addition, all loans identified as nonaccrual loans have related allowances for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contractual terms, the Company would have recognized additional interest income of approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Nonaccrual loans guaranteed by government agencies totaled approximately million at September 30, 2024 and approximately million at December 31, 2023.

Credit Quality Indicators The Company considers credit quality indicators to monitor the credit risk in the loan portfolio including volume and severity of loan delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, internal grading of loans, historical credit loss experience and economic conditions. These indicators are reviewed and updated regularly throughout the year. An internal risk grading system is used to indicate the credit risk of loans. The loan grades used by the Company are for internal risk identification purposes and do not directly correlate to regulatory categories or any financial reporting definitions. The general characteristics of the risk grades and the table summarizing the Company s gross loans held for investment by year of origination and internally assigned credit grades as of December 31, 2023, are disclosed in Note (5) to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company s revolving loans that are converted to term loans are not material and therefore have not been presented.

Purchased Credit Deteriorated Loans The Company has previously purchased loans, for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination. The Company did not purchase credit-deteriorated loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Collateral Dependent Loans A loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no material amount of interest income was recognized on collateral-dependent loans subsequent to their classification as collateral-dependent.

Balance at the end of the period 

The Company s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of Levels 1, 2 and 3 as of the end of the reporting period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not transfer any debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company transferred debt securities from Level 3 to Level 2 due to a review of the pricing models that determined some state and political subdivision securities to be Level 2. Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). These financial assets and financial liabilities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 3 inputs. The Company invests in equity securities without readily determinable fair values and utilizes Level 3 inputs. These equity securities are reported at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported as securities transactions in the noninterest income section of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Collateral dependent loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is dependent on liquidation of the collateral. When the Company determines that foreclosure is probable or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. In no case does the fair value of a collateral dependent loan exceed the fair value of the underlying collateral. The collateral dependent loans are adjusted to fair value through a specific allocation of the allowance for credit losses or a direct charge-down of the loan. Repossessed assets, upon initial recognition, are measured and adjusted to fair value through a charge-off to the allowance for possible credit losses based upon the fair value of the repossessed asset. Other real estate owned is revalued at fair value subsequent to initial recognition, with any losses recognized in net expense from other real estate owned.

days of origination. Loans held for sale are valued using Level 2 inputs. Gains or losses recognized upon the sale of the loans are determined on a specific identification basis. Loans Held For Investment To determine the fair value of loans held for investment, the Company uses an exit price calculation, which takes into account factors such as liquidity, credit and the nonperformance risk of loans. For certain homogeneous categories of loans, such as some residential mortgages, fair values are estimated using the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair values of other types of loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Deposits The fair values of transaction and savings accounts are the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit are estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Short-Term Borrowings The amounts payable on these short-term instruments are reasonable estimates of fair value. Subordinated Debt The fair values of subordinated debt are estimated using the rates that would be charged for subordinated debt of similar remaining maturities. Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit The fair values of commitments are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the terms of the agreements. The fair values of letters of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements.

The Company's credit exposure on oil and gas swaps and options varies based on the current market prices of oil and natural gas. Other than credit risk, changes in the fair value of customer positions will be offset by equal and opposite changes in the counterparty positions. The net positive fair value of the contracts represents the profit derived from the activity and is unaffected by the market price movements. The Company's share of total profit is approximately . Customer credit exposure is managed by strict position limits and is primarily offset by first liens on production while the remainder is offset by cash. Counterparty credit exposure is managed by selecting highly rated counterparties (rated A- or better by Standard and Poor's) and monitoring market information.

 The Company s net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 115.0 million from 104.3 million for the third quarter of 2023. Loan volume was the primary driver of the change in net interest income, but was partially offset by the impact of the shifting mix between interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.

 Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 48.7 million compared to 44.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Trust revenue, treasury income, sweep fees and insurance commissions each increased when compared to third quarter last year. 
 
 Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 86.7 million compared to 81.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily related to growth in salaries and employee benefits of 4.0 million. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company s total assets were 13.3 billion, an increase of 941.4 million from December 31, 2023.

Net Interest Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income, which is the Company s principal source of operating revenue, increased 10.6 million or 10.2 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the increase in net interest income was higher loan volume. Rate increases also attributed to the increase in net interest income. Higher loan volume and increasing rates were partially offset by the expense associated with the shifting mix between interest and noninterest-bearing deposits. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The Company s net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 increased compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 11.6 million or 3.6 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary driver of the increase in net interest income was higher loan volume. Rate increases also attributed to the increase in net interest income. Higher loan volume and increasing rates were partially offset by the expense associated with the shifting mix between interest and noninterest-bearing deposits. The Company s net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates, determine the changes in net interest income. The following volume/rate analysis summarizes the relative contribution of each of these components to the changes in net interest income.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 The Company establishes an allowance as an estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Management believes the allowance for credit losses is appropriate based upon management s best estimate of expected losses within the existing loan portfolio. Should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses change, the Company s estimate of expected credit losses could also change which could affect the amount of future provisions for credit losses. 
 The increased provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to loan growth. Net loan charge-offs were 775,000 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to net loan charge-offs of 1.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. 
 The increased provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to loan growth. Net loan charge-offs were 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.4 million for the same period of the prior year. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income increased by 4.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Trust revenue, treasury income, sweep fees and insurance commissions each increased when compared to last year. 
 Noninterest income included non-sufficient funds ("NSF") and overdraft fees totaling 8.2 million and 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represents 16.9 and 16.7 of the Company s noninterest income for the respective periods. In addition, the Company had debit card usage and interchange fees totaling 6.7 million and 6.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represents 13.7 and 14.9 of the Company s noninterest income for the respective periods. 
 Noninterest income decreased by 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to an approximate 10.9 million reduction of interchange fees related to the impact of the Durbin Amendment, which was offset by increases in trust revenue, treasury income, sweep fees and insurance commissions. 
 Noninterest income included NSF and overdraft fees totaling 22.7 million and 20.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represents 16.5 and 14.6 of the Company s noninterest income for the respective periods. In addition, the Company had debit card usage and interchange fees totaling 20.0 million and 31.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represents 14.5 and 22.1 of the Company s noninterest income for the respective periods. 
 The Company is subject to political pressures that could limit our ability to charge for NSF and overdraft fees and could adversely impact our noninterest income. On April 1, 2022, the Company lowered the rates charged on NSF and overdraft fees. The Company also became subject to the reduced interchange fees under the Durbin Amendment, effective July 1, 2023. Consequently, the Company's interchange fee revenue was reduced by approximately 10.9 million in the first half of 2024, as shown above, and reduced by 11.2 million in the last half of 2023. The reduced interchange fees under the Durbin Amendment have now been fully implemented. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense increased by 5.5 million for third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily related to growth in salaries and employee benefits of 4.0 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense increased by 12.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Higher noninterest expenses in 2024 was primarily related to growth in salaries and employee benefits of 8.4 million. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 20.3 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 21.8 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 21.4 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 22.0 or the first nine months of 2023. 
 The primary reasons for the difference between the Company s effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate were tax-exempt income, nondeductible expenses, federal and state tax credits and state tax expense.

(2) Tangible book value per common share is stockholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets, net, divided by common shares outstanding. This amount is a non-GAAP financial measure but has been included as it is considered to be a critical metric with which to analyze and evaluate the financial condition and capital strength of the Company. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. 

(3) Government agencies guaranteed approximately 7.5 million of nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024. 

Cash and Due from Banks, Federal Funds Sold and Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks 
 The aggregate of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks increased by 593.3 million or 24.7 , to 3.0 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase was related to an increase of interest-bearing deposits partially driven by maturing securities. 
 Securities 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total debt securities decreased 178.2 million, or 11.5 compared to December 31, 2023. The size of the Company s securities portfolio is determined by the Company s liquidity and asset/liability management. The net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale, before taxes, was 31.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to a net unrealized loss of 65.5 million at December 31, 2023. These unrealized losses, net of income tax, are included in the Company s stockholders equity as 
 38 

accumulated other comprehensive loss in the amounts of 24.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 50.0 million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased 522,000 of debt securities and did not sell any debt securities. 
 
 See Note (2) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding the Company s securities. 
 Loans 
 
 At September 30, 2024, total loans increased 528.1 million or 6.9 compared to December 31, 2023 as a result of internal loan growth. The preponderance of internal loan growth was from the Company's Oklahoma subsidiary BancFirst. BancFirst's strong liquidity was the driving force behind the loan growth. 
 See Note (3) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures regarding the Company s loan portfolio segments. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The overall credit quality of the Company's loan portfolio has remained strong. If unforeseen adverse changes occur in the national or local economy, or in the credit markets, it would be reasonable to expect that the allowance for credit losses would increase in future periods. 
 Nonaccrual Loans 
 The Company's nonaccrual and past due loans have increased, however, the level of these loans remains low. The Company s nonaccrual loans are primarily comprised of construction and development real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial non-real estate loans. Nonaccrual loans negatively impact the Company s net interest margin. A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in the opinion of management, the future collectability of both interest and principal is in serious doubt. Interest income is not recognized until the principal balance is fully collected. However, if the full collection of the remaining principal balance is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on certain of these loans on a cash basis. Had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contractual terms, the Company would have recognized additional interest income of approximately 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Only a small amount of this interest is expected to be ultimately collected. Approximately 7.5 million of nonaccrual loans were guaranteed by government agencies at September 30, 2024. 
 The classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that loan principal and interest will ultimately be uncollectible; although, in an economic downturn, the Company s experience has been that the risk of loss is heightened. The above normal risk associated with nonaccrual loans has been considered in the determination of the allowance for credit losses. The level of nonaccrual loans and credit losses could rise over time as a result of adverse economic conditions. 
 Modified Loans 
 As of January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2022-02, which eliminated the Troubled Debt Restructurings TDR recognition and measurement guidance and, instead, requires that the Company evaluate, based on the accounting for loan modifications, whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The current and future financial effects of the recorded balance of loans considered to be modified during the period were not considered to be material. The recorded balance of loans modified during the period ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 8.4 million compared to 5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets 
 OREO consists of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure and premises held for sale. These properties are carried at the lower of the book values of the related loans or fair values based upon appraisals of the properties, less estimated costs to sell. Write-downs arising at the time of reclassification of such properties from loans to OREO are charged directly to the allowance for credit losses. Any losses on bank premises designated to be sold are charged to operating expense at the time of transfer from premises to OREO. Decreases in values of properties subsequent to their classification as OREO are charged to operating expense. 
 OREO included a larger commercial real estate property recorded at 31.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 29.4 million at December 31, 2023. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company made 1.7 million of tenant improvements to this property, which contributed to the increase of total OREO. Rental income for this property is included in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Operating expense for this property is included in net expense from OREO in other noninterest expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Other Assets 
 Identifiable intangible assets and goodwill totaled 196.3 million and 199.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Other assets includes the cash surrender value of key-man life insurance policies totaling 83.9 million and 84.4 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Derivative financial instruments consisting of oil and gas swaps and option contracts are included in other assets and totaled 26.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 41.1 million at December 31, 2023. They require a daily margin to be posted, which fluctuates with oil and gas prices and customer activity. The Company had a margin liability included in other liabilities in the amount of 10.7 million at September 30, 2024 and 15.5 million at December 31, 2023. See Note (10) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of the Company s derivative financial instruments. 
 Equity securities are reported in other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. The Company invests in equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported as securities transactions in the noninterest income section of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The balance of equity securities was 12.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 13.1 million at December 31, 2023. The Company reviews its portfolio of equity securities for impairment at least quarterly. 
 Low-Income Housing and New Market Tax Credit Investments 
 During 2024, the Company s low-income housing tax credit ("LIHTC") investments and New Markets Tax Credits ("NMTC") investments, which are included in other assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, increased 10.2 million. 
 See Note (6) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for disclosures regarding these investments. 
 Liquidity and Funding 
 The Company s principal source of liquidity and funding is its broad deposit base generated from customer relationships. The availability of deposits is affected by economic conditions, competition with other financial institutions and alternative investments available to customers. Through interest rates paid, service charge levels and services offered, the Company can affect its level of deposits to a limited extent. The level and maturity of funding necessary to support the Company s lending and investment functions is determined through the Company s asset/liability management process. The Company currently does not rely heavily on long-term borrowings and does not utilize brokered or reciprocal deposits. The Company maintains lines of credit from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ), federal funds lines of credit with other banks and could also utilize the sale of loans, securities and liquidation of other assets as sources of liquidity and funding. The Company is highly liquid with a total of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks to total assets of 22.5 . 
 40 

There have not been any other material changes from the liquidity and funding discussion included in Management s Discussion and Analysis in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Deposits 
 At September 30, 2024, deposits totaled 11.5 billion, an increase of 774.2 million from December 31, 2023. The Company s core deposits provide it with a stable, low-cost funding source. The Company s core deposits as a percentage of total deposits were 95.8 at September 30, 2024 and 97.4 at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits were 33.6 at September 30, 2024 compared to 37.2 at December 31, 2023. Quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and competition for deposits has increased, and available yields have similarly increased, causing noninterest-bearing deposits to move to interest-bearing deposits and off-balance-sheet sweep account products. 
 Off-balance-sheet sweep accounts totaled 4.3 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The movement of customers' funds into the Company's off-balance-sheet sweep accounts affected the balances of both cash and deposits. 
 Subordinated Debt 
 See Note (5) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of the Company s subordinated debt. 
 Short-Term Borrowings and Lines of Credit
