The Dental segment results of operations were reclassified to income (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented, and we classified the Dental segment's assets and liabilities as held for sale for the year ended March 31, 2024 in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the transaction closing in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the held for sale assets and liabilities were classified as current as of March 31, 2024.

Acquisition and integration expenses totaled and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in acquisition and integration expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to charges related to the acquisition of assets from BD and a fair value adjustment related to a building held for sale from a previous acquisition during fiscal 2024. Acquisition and integration expenses are reported in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of our Consolidated Statements of Income and include, but are not limited to, investment banker, advisory, legal and other professional fees, and certain employee-related expenses.

 The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit borrowings, swing line borrowings and letters of credit, with sublimits for swing line borrowings and letters of credit.

and , respectively. The fiscal 2025 effective tax rates decreased when compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to changes in geographic mix of projected profits and an increase in favorable discrete items. 
 Income tax expense is provided on an interim basis based upon our estimate of the annual effective income tax rate, adjusted each quarter for discrete items. In determining the estimated annual effective income tax rate, we analyze various factors, including projections of our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated, the impact of state and local income taxes, our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards, and available tax planning alternatives. 
 We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various United States federal, state and local, as well as foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to United States federal examinations for years before fiscal 2018 and, with limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to United States state and local, or non-United States, income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2018. We remain subject to tax authority audits in various jurisdictions wherever we do business. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed an appeals process with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS regarding proposed audit adjustments related to deductibility of interest paid on intercompany debt for fiscal years 2016 through 2017. An agreement was reached on final interest rates, which also impacted subsequent years through 2020. The total federal, state, and local tax impact of the settlement including interest is approximately for the fiscal years 2016 through 2020, materially all of which has been paid through September 30, 2024. 
 . We are contesting the IRS s assertions and have filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court. We have not established reserves related to these notices. An unfavorable outcome is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position but could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period. 
 
 individual plaintiffs have filed such suits asserting individual personal injury claims and seeking compensatory and, if subsequently permitted by the court, punitive damages. The first trial of a plaintiff s claims is scheduled for November 2024. The Company disputes the allegations, is vigorously defending itself in these matters, and is pursuing potential contribution and indemnity from other parties. Nonetheless, management believes that based on the number of cases and the overall cost of defense, a loss is reasonably possible; however, a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because the evaluation of each case is highly fact-driven, subject to lengthy court proceedings, and impacted by each plaintiff's alleged disease, time and proximity of exposure, and other factors. We believe that the ultimate outcome of these pending lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole. 
 We believe we have adequately reserved for our current litigation and claims that are probable and estimable, and further believe that the ultimate outcome of these pending lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole. Due to their inherent uncertainty, however, there can

Additional Authorized Shares 
 The Company has an additional authorized share capital of preferred shares of par value each, plus deferred ordinary shares of par value each, in order to satisfy minimum statutory capital requirements for all Irish public limited companies. 
 
 (net of taxes, fees and commissions). As of September 30, 2024, there was (net of taxes, fees and commissions) of remaining availability under the Board authorized share repurchase program. The share repurchase program has no specified expiration date. 
 Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase its shares from time to time through open market purchases, including 10b5-1 plans. Any share repurchases may be activated, suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we repurchased of our ordinary shares for the aggregate amount of (net of fees and commissions) pursuant to authorizations, under the share repurchase program. During the first six months of fiscal 2024, we had no share repurchase activity. 
 During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we obtained of our ordinary shares in the aggregate amount of in connection with share-based compensation award programs. During the first six months of fiscal 2024, we obtained of our ordinary shares in the aggregate amount of in connection with share-based compensation award programs. 
 
 ordinary shares remained available for grant under the long-term incentive plan. 
 The fair value of share-based stock option compensation awards was estimated at their grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. This model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics that are not present in our option grants. If the model permitted consideration of the unique characteristics of employee stock options, the resulting estimate of the fair value of the stock options could be different. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The expense is classified as Cost of revenues or Selling, general, and administrative expenses in a manner consistent with the employee s compensation and benefits.

Expected life of options years years Expected dividend yield of stock Expected volatility of stock 
 The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The expected life of options is reflective of historical experience, vesting schedules and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield of stock represents our best estimate of the expected future dividend yield. The expected volatility of stock is derived by referring to our historical stock prices over a time frame similar to that of the expected life of the grant. An estimated forfeiture rate of and was applied in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. This rate is calculated based upon historical activity and represents an estimate of the granted options not expected to vest. If actual forfeitures differ from this calculated rate, we may be required to make additional adjustments to compensation expense in future periods. The assumptions used above are reviewed at the time of each significant option grant, or at least annually.

 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax difference between the closing price of our ordinary shares on September 30, 2024 over the exercise prices of the stock options, multiplied by the number of options outstanding or outstanding and exercisable, as applicable. The aggregate intrinsic value is not recorded for financial accounting purposes and the value changes daily based on the daily changes in the fair market value of our ordinary shares.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of STERIS plc: 
 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 
 We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of STERIS plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and shareholders equity for the three- and six- month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six- month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedule (not presented herein); and in our report dated May 29, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 
 Basis for Review Results 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Introduction 
 In Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the MD A ), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for STERIS including: 
 what factors affect our business; 
 what our earnings and costs were in each period presented; 
 why those earnings and costs were different from prior periods; 
 where our earnings came from; 
 how this affects our overall financial condition; 
 what our expenditures for capital projects were; and 
 where cash will come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchases of shares, cash dividends and future working capital needs. 
 As you read the MD A, it may be helpful to refer to information in our consolidated financial statements contained herein, which present the results of our operations for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. It may also be helpful to refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 29, 2024, including information in Item 1, "Business," Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies," and Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report, for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 In the MD A, we analyze and explain the period-over-period changes in the specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This information, discussion, and analysis may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in STERIS. 
 Financial Measures 
 In the following sections of the MD A, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). We sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. We define these financial measures as follows: 
 Backlog We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. We use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements. 
 Debt-to-total capital We define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders equity. We use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth. 
 Days sales outstanding DSO We define DSO as the average collection period for accounts receivable. It is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters revenues, multiplied by 365 days. We use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect. 
 We, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules. We have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. These financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies, and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. Additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure, is available in the subsection of MD A titled, "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 Revenues Defined 
 As required by Regulation S-X, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income for each period presented. When we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the Regulation S-X requirements. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenues: 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Revenues Our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances. 
 Product Revenues We define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products. 
 Service Revenues We define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. Service revenues also include outsourced reprocessing services and instrument and scope repairs, as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our Applied Sterilization Technologies ("AST") segment. 
 Capital Equipment Revenues We define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam and gas sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, pure steam/water systems, surgical lights and tables, and integrated operating rooms ("OR"). 
 Consumable Revenues We define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes dedicated consumables used in our V-PRO sterilizers and automated endoscope reprocessors, SYSTEM 1 and 1E consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, instruments and tools, sterility assurance products, barrier protection solutions, and cleaning consumables. 
 Recurring Revenues We define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues. 
 
 General Company Overview and Executive Summary 
 STERIS is a leading global provider of products and services that support patient care with an emphasis on infection prevention. WE HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare and life science products and services around the globe. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative products and services. These include: consumable products, such as detergents, endoscopy accessories, barrier products, instruments and tools; services, including equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair, laboratory testing, and outsourced reprocessing; capital equipment, such as sterilizers, surgical tables, and automated endoscope reprocessors; and connectivity solutions such as OR integrati on. 
 We operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments: Healthcare, AST, and Life Sciences. Previously, we had four reportable business segments; however, as a result of the divestiture of our Dental segment, Dental is presented as discontinued operations. Historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to exclude discontinued operations for comparability, as required. For more information, refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "Discontinued Operations." Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income. We describe our business segments in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements titled, "Business Segment Information." 
 The bulk of our revenues are derived from healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical Customers. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. 
 In addition, there is increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures . During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions, which continued to expand our product and service offerings in the Healthcare and AST segments. Total aggregate consideration was approximately 17.5 million . 
 On August 2, 2023 , we purchased the surgical instrumentation, laparoscopic instrumentation and sterilization container assets from Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE: BDX) ("BD"). The acquired assets from BD were integrated into our Healthcare segment. 
 The purchase price of the BD acquisition was 539.8 million. The acquisition also qualified for a tax benefit related to tax deductible goodwill, with a present value of approximately 60.0 million . The purchase price of the acquisition was financed with borrowings from our Previous Revolving Credit Facility. For more information, refer to Note 7 titled, " Debt." 
 Acquisition and integration expenses totaled 3.2 million and 5.5 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Acquisition and integration expenses totaled 15.8 million and 18.0 million for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in acquisition and integration expenses for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to charges related to the acquisition of assets from BD and a fair value adjustment related to a building held for sale from a previous acquisition during fiscal 2024. Acquisition and integration expenses are reported in the Selling, general and administrative expenses line of our Consolidated Statements of Income and 
 32

 include, but are not limited to, investment banker, advisory, legal and other professional fees, and certain employee-related expenses. 
 On April 1, 2024, we completed the sale of the Controlled Environment Certification Services business. We recorded net proceeds of 41.9 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of 19.2 million in fiscal 2025. The business generated approximately 35.0 million in revenues in fiscal 2024. 
 For more information regarding our recent acquisitions, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled, " Business Acquisitions and Divestitures ." 
 Discontinued Operations . On April 11, 2024, the Company announced its plan to sell substantially all of the net assets of its Dental segment for total cash consideration of 787.5 million , subject to customary adjustments, and up to an additional 12.5 million in contingent payment should the Dental business achieve certain revenue targets in fiscal 2025. The transaction was structured as an equity sale and closed on May 31, 2024. A component of an entity is reported in discontinued operations after meeting the criteria for held for sale classification if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the divestiture of our Dental segment and determined that those conditions for discontinued operations presentation had been met prior to March 31, 2024. The Dental segment results of operations were reclassified to income (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented, and we classified the Dental segment's assets and liabilities as held for sale as of March 31, 2024 in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the transaction closing in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the held for sale assets and liabilities were classified as current as of March 31, 2024. Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include the financial results of the Dental segment through the date of sale on May 31, 2024. A majority of the proceeds received from the sale were utilized to pay off existing debt. 
 For more information, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements titled, " Discontinued Operations ." 
 Highlights. Revenues increased 7.3 to 1,328.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,238.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Revenues increased 7.7 to 2,608.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,421.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increases reflect higher volume, including the added volume from the acquisition of assets from BD in the Healthcare segment, and pricing. 
 Gross profit percentage for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 43.6 compared to the gross profit percentage for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 of 44.1 . Gross profit percentage for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 44.1 compared to the gross profit percentage for the first six months of fiscal 2024 of 44.4 . The decrease in gross profit percentage for the three and six periods reflects unfavorable impacts from labor and overhead costs, productivity, and adjustments and other charges that were partially offset by favorable impacts from pricing. 
 Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 219.7 million, compared to income from operations of 191.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Income from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was 405.2 million, compared to income from operations of 389.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The increase in income from operations for the three and six month periods is primarily due to increased volume, including added volume from the acquisition of assets from BD, and pricing, which was partially offset by increased labor costs. 
 Cash flows from operations were 554.5 million and free cash flow was 344.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to cash flows from operations of 427.2 million and free cash flow of 284.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024 (see the subsection below titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow). The fiscal 2025 increase in cash flows from operations and free cash flow resulted from the increase in cash provided by working capital, primarily driven by higher collections on accounts receivable and improved inventory management when compared to the same prior year period. 
 Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 25.3 at September 30, 2024 and 33.7 at March 31, 2024. During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we declared and paid cash dividends totaling 1.09 per ordinary share. 
 Additional information regarding our financial performance during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 is included in the subsection below titled Results of Operations. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 We, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. We, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 These non-GAAP financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented. 
 We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. It is important for the reader to note that the non-GAAP financial measures used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles (capital expenditures) plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. 
 The following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: Six Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 554,468 427,224 Purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, net (209,975) (149,893) Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles 7,360 Free cash flow 344,493 284,691 
 
 Results of Operations 
 In the following subsections, we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the same fiscal 2024 period. We begin with a general overview of our operating results and then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments. 
 Revenues. The following tables compare our revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 to the revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent Change Total revenues 1,328,912 1,238,204 90,708 7.3 Revenues by type: Service revenues 633,004 580,024 52,980 9.1 Consumable revenues 414,359 366,083 48,276 13.2 Capital equipment revenues 281,549 292,097 (10,548) (3.6) Revenues by geography: Ireland revenues 22,802 20,399 2,403 11.8 United States revenues 979,528 909,651 69,877 7.7 Other foreign revenues 326,582 308,154 18,428 6.0 
 Revenues increased 7.3 to 1,328.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,238.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase reflects organic growth, primarily driven by volume in the Healthcare segment, and pricing across all three segments. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 Service revenues increased 9.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting growth in the Healthcare and AST segments, which was partially offset by a decline in the Life Sciences segment caused by the divestiture of the Controlled Environment Certification Services ("CECS") business. Consumable revenues increased by 13.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting growth in the Healthcare and Life Sciences segments.

 Ireland revenues increased 11.8 to 22.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.4 million for the same period in the prior year, reflecting growth in consumable and service revenues, partially offset by a decline in capital equipment revenues. 
 United States revenues increased 7.7 to 979.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 909.7 million for the same period in the prior year, reflecting growth in service and consumable revenues, partially offset by a decline in capital equipment revenues. 
 Revenues from other foreign locations increased 6.0 to 326.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 308.2 million for the same period in the prior year, reflecting growth in the Europe, Middle East Africa ("EMEA"), Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by a decline in the Canadian region.

 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses SG A are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment expenses, facility costs, and other general and administrative expenses. SG A increased 0.3 and 4.7 in the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. The fiscal 2025 increase is primarily attributable to increased compensation, including benefit costs, as well as increases in professional fees. 
 Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased 2.9 and 3.2 in the three and six month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. Research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. During fiscal 2025, our investments in research and development have continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures. 
 Restructuring Expenses. In May 2024, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "Restructuring Plan"). This plan includes a strategic shift in our approach to the Healthcare surgical business in Europe, as well as other actions including the impairment of an internally developed X-ray accelerator, product rationalizations and facility consolidations. Fewer than 300 positions are being eliminated. These restructuring actions are designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency, and we expect these actions to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2025. We anticipate improvements in income from operations of approximately 25.0 million per year, with the majority of the benefit being in fiscal 2026 and beyond due to timing of actions. 
 The following tables summarize our total pre-tax restructuring expenses recorded in fiscal 2025 related to the Restructuring Plan: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Six Months Ended September 30, Restructuring Plan Severance and other compensation related costs

The fiscal 2025 effective tax rates decreased when compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to changes in geographic mix of projected profits and an increase in favorable discrete items. 
 Business Segment Results of Operations. 
 We operate and report our financial information in three reportable business segments: Healthcare, AST, and Life Sciences. Previously, we had four reportable business segments; however, as a result of the divestiture of our Dental segment, Dental is presented as discontinued operations. Historical information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect these changes for comparability, as required. 
 Our Healthcare segment provides a comprehensive offering for healthcare providers worldwide, focused on sterile processing departments and procedural centers, such as operating rooms and endoscopy suites. Our products and services range from infection prevention consumables and capital equipment, as well as services to maintain that equipment; to the repair of re-usable procedural instruments; to outsourced instrument reprocessing services. In addition, our procedural solutions also include endoscopy accessories, instruments, and capital equipment infrastructure used primarily in operating rooms, ambulatory surgery centers, endoscopy suites, and other procedural areas. 
 Our AST segment supports medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers through a global network of contract sterilization and laboratory testing facilities, and integrated sterilization equipment and control systems. Our technology-neutral offering supports Customers every step of the way, from testing through sterilization. 
 Our Life Sciences segment provides a comprehensive offering of products and services designed to support biopharmaceutical and medical device research and manufacturing facilities, in particular those focused on aseptic manufacturing. Our portfolio includes a full suite of consumable products, equipment maintenance, specialty services, and capital equipment. 
 We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. 
 For the three and six months e nded September 30, 2024 and 2023 , revenues from a single Customer did not represent ten percent or more of the Healthcare, AST or Life Sciences segment revenues. 
 A dditional information regarding our segments is included in our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on May 29, 2024.

 Organic revenue growth and constant currency organic revenue growth are non-GAAP financial measures of revenue performance. Organic revenue growth is calculated by removing the impact of acquisitions and divestitures for one year following the respective transaction from the GAAP revenue growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth is subject to a further adjustment to eliminate the impact of foreign currency movements. 
 Healthcare revenues increased 8.5 to 944.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 870.1 million for the same prior year period. This increase reflects growth in service and consumable revenues of 14.1 and 11.7 , respectively, which was partially offset by a decline in capital equipment revenues of 2.0 . The constant currency organic growth of 7.1 is primarily due to increased volume, impacting revenues by a mid-single digit percentage, as well as increased pricing. Healthcare revenues increased 9.3 to 1,845.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,688.9 million for the same prior year period. This increase reflects growth in consumable and service revenues of 16.8 and 14.2 , respectively, which was partially offset by a decline in capital equipment revenues of 5.8 . The constant currency organic growth of 6.2 is primarily due to increased volume, impacting revenues by a mid-single digit percentage, as well as increased pricing. 
 The Healthcare segment's backlog at September 30, 2024 was 405.3 million. The Healthcare segment's backlog at September 30, 2023 was 457.1 million. The decrease is due to shortened lead times in fiscal 2024 due to improving supply chains, which drove strong shipments throughout fiscal 2024. 
 AST revenues increased 9.2 to 256.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 235.1 million for the same prior year period. The constant currency organic growth of 8.7 is primarily due to increased pricing, impacting revenues by a mid-single digit percentage, as well as increased volume. AST revenues increased 8.2 to 506.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 468.2 million for the same prior year period. The constant currency organic growth of 8.2 is primarily due to increased pricing, impacting revenues by a mid-single digit percentage, as well as increased volume. 
 Life Sciences revenues decreased 3.9 to 127.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 133.1 million for the same prior year period. This decrease is partially due to the sale of the CECS business, resulting in a decline of 14.2 in service revenues. This decrease also reflects declines in capital equipment revenues of 35.1 , which was partially offset by growth in consumable revenues of 21.4 . The constant currency organic growth of 3.0 is primarily due to increased pricing, impacting revenues by a low single digit percentage. Life Sciences revenues decreased 3.1 to 256.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 264.5 million for the same prior year period. This decrease is partially due to the sale of the CECS business, resulting in a decline of 15.6 in service revenues. This decrease also reflects declines in capital equipment revenues of 25.5 which was partially offset by growth in consumable revenues of 17.2 . The constant currency organic growth of 3.6 is primarily due to increased pricing, impacting revenues by a low single digit percentage. 
 The Life Sciences backlog at September 30, 2024 was 75.6 million. The Life Sciences backlog at September 30, 2023 was 91.1 million. The decrease is primarily due to softening demand.

 Cash dividends paid to ordinary shareholders During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we paid total cash dividends of 107.7 million, or 1.09 per outstanding share. During the first six months of fiscal 2024, we paid total cash dividends of 97.8 million, or 0.99 per outstanding share. 
 Transactions with noncontrolling interest holders During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we received 2.5 million in contributions from noncontrolling interest holders. 
 Stock option and other equity transactions, net We generally receive cash for issuing shares under our stock option programs. During the first six months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, we received cash proceeds totaling 19.1 million and 2.7 million, respectively, under these programs. 
 Cash Flow Measures. The net cash provided by our operating activities was 554.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 427.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. Free cash flow was 344.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 284.7 million in the first six months of fiscal 2024 (see the subsection above titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of cash flows from operations to free cash flow). The fiscal 2025 increase in free cash flow is primarily due to an increase in cash provided by working capital, primarily driven by higher collections on accounts receivable and improved inventory management when compared to the same prior year period, which was partially offset by increased capital spending. 
 Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 25.3 at September 30, 2024 and 35.7 at September 30, 2023. 
 Material Future Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments. Information related to our material future cash obligations and commercial commitments is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on May 29, 2024. Our commercial commitments were approximately 120.6 million at September 30, 2024, reflecting a net increase of 10.2 million in surety bonds and other commercial commitments from March 31, 2024. Outstanding borrowings under our Previous Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 were 141.4 million. We had 12.3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Previous Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Requirements. We intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations for short-term and long-term capital expenditures and our other liquidity needs. Our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our r ate of sales growth, our Customers acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our expenses and other factors. To th e extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities. There can be no assurance that our existing financing arrangements will provide us with sufficient funds or that we will be able to obtain any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all.

Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 STERIS plc ("Parent") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, STERIS Limited and STERIS Corporation (collectively "Guarantors" and each a "Guarantor"), each have provided guarantees of the obligations of STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company ("FinCo", "STERIS Irish FinCo", "Issuer") a wholly-owned subsidiary issuer, under Senior Public Notes issued by FinCo on April 1, 2021 and of certain other obligations relating to the Senior Public Notes. The Senior Public Notes are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis. The Senior Public Notes and the related guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of FinCo and the Guarantors, respectively, and are equal in priority with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, from time to time outstanding, including, as applicable, under the Private Placement Senior Notes and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 All of the liabilities of non-guarantor direct and indirect subsidiaries of STERIS, other than STERIS Irish FinCo, STERIS Limited and STERIS Corporation, including any claims of trade creditors, are effectively senior to the Senior Public Notes. 
 STERIS Irish FinCo s main objective and source of revenues and cash flows is the provision of short- and long-term financing for the activities of STERIS plc and its subsidiaries. 
 The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, interest and other fees to the Issuer and ability of the Issuer and Guarantors to service the Senior Public Notes may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as agreements to which our subsidiaries are or may become a party. 
 The following is a summary of these guarantees: 
 Guarantees of Senior Notes 
 Parent Company Guarantor STERIS plc 
 Subsidiary Issuer STERIS Irish FinCo Unlimited Company 
 Subsidiary Guarantor STERIS Limited 
 Subsidiary Guarantor STERIS Corporation 
 The guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged: 
 in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture; 
 in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, other than to the Parent or a subsidiary of the Parent and as permitted by the indenture; 
 in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, at such time as such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a borrower under or no longer guarantees any material credit facility (subject to restatement in specified circumstances); 
 upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Senior Public Notes or the discharge of the Issuer s obligations under the indenture in accordance with the terms of the indenture; 
 as described in accordance with the terms of the indenture; or 
 in the case of the Parent, if the Issuer ceases for any reason to be a subsidiary of the Parent; provided that all guarantees and other obligations of the Parent in respect of all other indebtedness under any material credit facility of the Issuer terminate upon the Issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of the Parent; and 
 upon such Guarantor delivering to the trustee an officer s certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction or release have been complied with. 
 The obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee are expressly limited to the maximum amount that such Guarantor could guarantee without such guarantee constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution from each Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 
 Information related to our critical accounting estimates and assumptions is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on May 29, 2024. Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions have not changed materially from March 31, 2024. 
 Contingencies 
 We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, gases, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief. 
 We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. We have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. We record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information. 
 We are subject to taxation from United States federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. The IRS routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns. 
 Refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Income Taxes" for more information. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This quarterly report may contain statements concerning certain trends, expectations, forecasts, estimates, or other forward-looking information affecting or relating to STERIS or its industry, products or activities that are intended to qualify for the protections afforded forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other laws and regulations. Forward-looking statements speak only as to the date the statement is made and may be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as may, will, expects, believes, anticipates, plans, estimates, projects, targets, forecasts, outlook, impact, potential, confidence, improve, optimistic, deliver, orders, backlog, comfortable, trend, and seeks, or the negative of such terms or other variations on such terms or comparable terminology. Many important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements related to the expected benefits of and timing of completion of the Restructuring Plan, disruption of production or supplies, changes in market conditions, political events, pending or future claims or litigation, competitive factors, technology advances, actions of regulatory agencies, and changes in laws, government regulations, labeling or product approvals or the application or interpretation thereof. Many of these important factors are outside of STERIS s control. No assurances can be provided as to any result or the timing of any outcome regarding matters described in STERIS s securities filings or otherwise with respect to any regulatory action, administrative proceedings, government investigations, litigation, warning letters, cost reductions, business strategies, earnings or revenue trends or future financial results. References to products are summaries only and should not be considered the specific terms of the product clearance or literature. Unless legally required, STERIS does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements even if events make clear that any projected results, express or implied, will not be realized. Other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, (a) the impact of public health crises on STERIS s operations, supply chain, material and labor costs, performance, results, prospects, or value, (b) STERIS's ability to achieve the expected benefits regarding the accounting and tax treatments of the redomiciliation to Ireland, (c) operating costs, Customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, Customers, clients or suppliers) being greater than expected, (d) STERIS s ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into its existing businesses, including unknown or inestimable liabilities, impairments, or increases in expected integration costs or difficulties in connection with the integration of such businesses, (e) uncertainties related to tax treatments under the TCJA and the IRA, (f) the possibility that Pillar Two Model Rules could increase tax uncertainty and adversely impact STERIS's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate and subject STERIS to additional income tax in jurisdictions who adopt Pillar Two Model Rules, (g) STERIS's ability to continue to qualify for benefits under certain income tax treaties in light of ratification of more strict income tax treaty rules (through the MLI) in many jurisdictions where STERIS has operations, (h) changes in tax laws or interpretations that could increase our consolidated tax liabilities, including changes in tax laws that would result in STERIS being treated as a domestic corporation for United States federal tax purposes, (i) the potential for increased pressure on pricing or costs that leads to erosion of profit margins, including as a result of inflation, (j) the possibility that market demand will not develop for new technologies, products or applications or services, or business initiatives will take longer, cost more or produce lower benefits than anticipated, (k) the possibility that application of or compliance with laws, court rulings, certifications, regulations, or regulatory actions, including without limitation any of the same relating to FDA, EPA or other regulatory authorities, government investigations, the outcome of any pending or

 threatened FDA, EPA or other regulatory warning notices, actions, requests, inspections or submissions, the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation brought by private parties, or other requirements or standards may delay, limit or prevent new product or service introductions, affect the production, supply and/or marketing of existing products or services, result in costs to STERIS that may not be covered by insurance, or otherwise affect STERIS s performance, results, prospects or value, (l) the potential of international unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Hamas military conflicts, economic downturn or effects of currencies, tax assessments, tariffs and/or other trade barriers, adjustments or anticipated rates, raw material costs or availability, benefit or retirement plan costs, or other regulatory compliance costs, (m) the possibility of reduced demand, or reductions in the rate of growth in demand, for STERIS s products and services, (n) the possibility of delays in receipt of orders, order cancellations, or delays in the manufacture or shipment of ordered products, due to supply chain issues or otherwise, or in the provision of services, (o) the possibility that anticipated growth, cost savings, new product acceptance, performance or approvals, or other results may not be achieved, or that transition, labor, competition, timing, execution, impairments, regulatory, governmental, or other issues or risks associated with STERIS s businesses, industry or initiatives including, without limitation, those matters described in STERIS's various securities filings, may adversely impact STERIS s performance, results, prospects or value, (p) the impact on STERIS and its operations, or tax liabilities, of Brexit or the exit of other member countries from the EU, and the Company s ability to respond to such impacts, (q) the impact on STERIS and its operations of any legislation, regulations or orders, including but not limited to any new trade or tax legislation (including CAMT and excise tax on stock buybacks), regulations or orders, that may be implemented by the U.S. administration or Congress, or of any responses thereto, (r) the possibility that anticipated financial results or benefits of recent acquisitions, of STERIS s restructuring efforts, or of recent divestitures, including anticipated revenue, productivity improvement, cost savings, growth synergies and other anticipated benefits, will not be realized or will be other than anticipated, (s) the level of STERIS s indebtedness limiting financial flexibility or increasing future borrowing costs, (t) rating agency actions or other occurrences that could affect STERIS s existing debt or future ability to borrow funds at rates favorable to STERIS or at all, (u) the effects of changes in credit availability and pricing, as well as the ability of STERIS s Customers and suppliers to adequately access the credit markets, on favorable terms or at all, when needed, and (v) the possibility that our expectations about the pre-tax savings resulting from the Restructuring Plan, the number of positions eliminated pursuant to the Restructuring Plan and the costs, charges and cash expenditures associated with the announced restructuring plan may not be realized on the timeline or timelines we expect, or at all. 
 Availability of Securities and Exchange Commission Filings 
 We make available free of charge on or through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC.

The information on our website and the SEC's website is not incorporated by reference into this report. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to interest rate, currency, and commodity risks. Information related to these risks and our management of these exposures is included in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on May 29, 2024. Our exposures to market risks have not changed materially since March 31, 2024. 
 Fluctuations in currency rates could affect our revenues, Cost of revenues and income from operations and could result in currency exchange gains and losses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we held forward foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of our expected non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings against our reporting currency, the US dollar. These foreign currency exchange contracts will mature during fiscal 2025. We did not elect hedge accounting for these forward currency contracts; however, we may seek to apply hedge accounting in future scenarios. As a result, we may experience volatility due to (i) the timing mismatch of unrealized hedge gains or losses versus recognition of the underlying hedged earnings, and (ii) the impact of unrealized and realized hedge gains or losses being reported in selling, general and administrative expenses, whereas the offsetting economic gains and losses of the underlying hedged earnings are reported in the various line items of our Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At September 30, 2024, we held net foreign currency forward contracts to buy 58.0 million British pounds sterling; and to sell 18.0 million Australian dollars, 6.0 million Canadian dollars, and 1.8 million euros. 
 We are dependent on basic raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies used in our operations. Our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials. The costs of these materials can rise suddenly and result in significantly higher costs of production. Where appropriate, we enter into long-term supply contracts as a basis to guarantee a reliable supply. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in a certain commodity that impacts raw materials included in our Cost of revenues. At September 30, 2024, we held commodity swap contracts to buy 394.5 thousand pounds of nickel.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer PEO and Principal Financial Officer PFO ), we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, including the assessment and input of our management, the PEO and PFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Exhibit 10.1 

 Description of STERIS plc Non-Employee Director Compensation Program 
 
 Summarized below is the Director compensation program for STERIS plc STERIS non-employee Directors for the term of office beginning August 1, 2024. 
 
 Director retainer fees have remained the same for the 2024-2025 term of office as for the prior term of office. An annual retainer of 323,000 is payable to each non-employee Director other than the Chairman of the Board. An annual retainer of 498,000 is payable to the Chairman. The retainer fees are payable in full at the beginning of each Director s term. Retainer fees are fully vested immediately, regardless of the form in which paid. 
 
 Committee membership fees, which are payable to Committee members (other than Committee Chairpersons) for the 2024-2025 term remain the same. These fees are as follows 
 
 12,000 Audit Committee member, 
 7,500 Compensation and Organization Development Committee member, and 
 6,000 per Committee for members of other standing Committees. 
 
 Annual Committee Chair fees also remain unchanged and are payable in the following amounts, with payments to be made at the beginning of each term 25,000 for the Audit Committee Chair, 20,000 for the Compensation and Organization Development Committee Chair, and 15,000 for the other standing Committee Chairs. Committee Chairs will receive their fees in cash, unless another form of payment is elected. There are no meeting fees. 
 
 The normal forms of retainer fees are payable as follows 86,000 in cash 123,000 for the Chairman), 118,500 in stock options 187,500 for the Chairman) and 118,500 in CRSUs 187,500 for the Chairman). Each Director (other than Directors who have not satisfied the Guidelines) is given the option to elect to receive all or a part of the cash or option portions of the fee in STERIS shares or CRSUs and, subject to the limited exception referred below, to elect to receive all or part of the CRSU portion of the fee in STERIS shares. 
 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the available forms of payment for Directors who have not satisfied the Company s Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines are limited until such time as those Guidelines have been satisfied. A Director who has not met the Guidelines will receive a retainer fee of 86,000 in cash, with the remaining portion of such Director s retainer fee payable in CRSUs. The Director also may elect to receive additional CRSUs in lieu of all or part of the cash portion of the retainer fee, except in the case of the Director s first full term of office. 
 
 Permitted elections for incumbent Directors are required to be made on or before the December 31 that immediately precedes the beginning of the term for which the compensation will be paid. Elections for the term of office beginning in 2025 must be made by December 31, 2024. 
 
 The number of CRSUs or STERIS shares a Director is entitled to receive is determined based upon the dollar amount of the retainer fees elected to be received in CRSUs or STERIS shares, and the NYSE STERIS per share closing price on the effective date of grant. The number of options a Director is entitled to receive is determined based upon the same factors and a Black-Scholes calculation, and the option price is the NYSE per share closing price on the effective date of grant. 

A Director s CRSUs will be settled in STERIS ordinary shares six months after the cessation of the Director s Board service. Directors will be paid cash dividend equivalents on their CRSUs as dividends are paid on STERIS ordinary shares. 
 
 The STERIS Director compensation program for non-employee Directors may be modified by the Board of Directors.
