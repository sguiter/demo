 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, these financial statements do not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP or SEC rules and regulations for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the valuation of acquisition-related assets and liabilities, expected credit losses, programming and copyright expenses, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair value measurements, impairment assessments, capitalization of internal costs associated with construction and installation activities, useful lives of long-lived assets and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

The preliminary opening balance sheet is subject to adjustment based on our final assessment of the fair values of the acquired identifiable net assets and liabilities, which primarily comprise spectrum and customer relationship intangible assets that remain open to finalize.

 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments of our borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions. Collateral has not been posted by either party under the derivative instruments of our borrowing groups. At September 30, 2024, our exposure to counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative instruments, as set forth in the assets and liabilities table above, included derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of million. 
 Each of our borrowing groups has entered into derivative instruments under agreements with each counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements under each of these master agreements are limited to the derivative instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups. 
 Details of our Derivative Instruments 
 Interest Rate Derivative Contracts 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 We enter into interest rate swaps to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt. Pursuant to these derivative instruments, we typically pay fixed interest rates and receive variable interest rates on specified notional amounts.

 Capped Call Option Contracts 
 During June 2024, we entered into capped call option contracts, pursuant to which we have purchased capped call options on million and million Liberty Latin America Class A and Class C common shares, respectively, with a low exercise price and a capped payout. These contracts will expire to months following the June 2024 trade date and can result in the receipt of cash or shares at our election. Shares acquired through the exercise of the call options will be included in our share repurchases. The capped call option contracts are not considered derivative instruments as the contracts are indexed to our Class A and Class C common shares and are therefore classified within shareholders equity. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate premium associated with these capped call option contracts of million is included as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our condensed consolidated statement of equity and as a financing cash outflow in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income tax benefit attributable to our loss before income taxes differs from the amounts computed using the statutory tax rate, primarily due to the beneficial effects of international rate differences, net decreases in valuation allowances and permanent tax differences, such as non-taxable income. These beneficial effects were partially offset by the detrimental effects of non-deductible goodwill impairment, permanent tax differences, such as non-deductible expenses and inclusion of withholding taxes on cross-border payments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax benefit reflects our estimate of global minimum tax which has been reduced for changes in legislative landscape and updated current and forecasted operating results. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax benefit reflects effects of net legislative increase to the statutory tax rate in Barbados and the net detrimental effects of the inclusion of global minimum tax.

Overview 
 General 
 We are an international provider of fixed, mobile and subsea telecommunications services. We provide, 
 A. residential and B2B services in: 
 i. over 20 countries across Latin America and the Caribbean through two of our reportable segments, C W Caribbean and C W Panama; 
 ii. Puerto Rico and USVI, through our reportable segment Liberty Puerto Rico; and 
 iii. Costa Rica, through our reportable segment Liberty Costa Rica. 
 B. through our reportable segment Liberty Networks, (i) enterprise services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (ii) wholesale services over our subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks that connect approximately 40 markets in that region. 
 At September 30, 2024, we (i) owned and operated fixed networks that passed 4,713,000 homes and served 3,986,100 RGUs, comprising 1,824,500 broadband internet subscribers, 1,232,700 fixed-line telephony subscribers and 928,900 video subscribers and (ii) served 7,989,300 mobile subscribers. 
 Hurricane Beryl 
 In July 2024, Hurricane Beryl impacted our Jamaica operations and certain smaller operations within C W Caribbean, resulting in varying degrees of damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructures in these markets. In connection with Hurricane Beryl, during the third quarter of 2024, we experienced adverse impacts to revenue and RGUs, Adjusted OIBDA, and property and equipment additions, which we expect will continue during the fourth quarter of 2024. Specifically, during the third quarter of 2024, Hurricane Beryl had a negative impact on revenue and Adjusted OIBDA of approximately 5 million and 8 million, respectively, which includes the positive impact from the hurricane on prepaid revenue. In addition, we incurred property and equipment additions of approximately 7 million to replace infrastructure and equipment that has been damaged beyond repair or to enhance network resiliency. We did not recognize any material impairments in connection with Hurricane Beryl. As a result of the hurricane, during the third quarter of 2024, we estimate that we lost approximately 33,000 RGUs, comprising 16,000 broadband internet subscribers, 15,000 fixed-line telephony subscribers, and 2,000 video subscribers. We also saw a positive impact from the hurricane to our prepaid mobile subscribers. Hurricane Beryl did not have a material impact on our homes passed count. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to continue to see adverse impacts from Hurricane Beryl on our impacted businesses. Currently, we estimate that Hurricane Beryl will negatively impact revenue and Adjusted OIBDA during the fourth quarter by between 5 million and 10 million, mainly driven by subscriber losses. We also expect to incur additional property and equipment additions of approximately 10 million to 15 million. Together with the third quarter impacts, we expect that the aggregate impact from Hurricane Beryl during 2024 for revenue and Adjusted OIBDA will be between 10 million and 20 million and toward the high end of our expected range of 10 million to 20 million for property and equipment additions. 
 Hurricane Beryl triggered a claim pursuant to the Weather Derivatives, which resulted in net proceeds of 44 million during the third quarter of 2024. The proceeds associated with this claim are reflected as a derivative gain in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and as a cash inflow related to operating activities in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 Costa Rica Transaction 
 
 On August 1, 2024, we announced that we entered into an agreement with Millicom to combine our respective operations in Costa Rica. Under the terms of the all-stock agreement, Liberty Latin America and our minority partner in Costa Rica will hold an approximate 86 interest and Millicom will hold an approximate 14 interest in the joint operations, with final ownership percentages to be confirmed at closing. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory authorizations, and we expect the transaction to be completed during the second half of 2025. 
 
 40 

During August 2024, we also entered into an agreement with the noncontrolling interest owner of Liberty Costa Rica where we agreed to acquire on January 30, 2026 shares representing 8.5 of equity of Liberty Costa Rica for aggregate cash consideration of approximately 82 million, comprising CRC 22 billion 42 million) and 40 million, with 62.5 of the purchase price due upon closing and the remaining 37.5 due on January 29, 2027. 

Material Changes in Results of Operations 
 The comparability of our operating results during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is affected by an acquisition and FX. As we use the term, organic changes exclude FX and the impact of an acquisition. 
 In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impacts on the operating results of the periods under comparison that are attributable to the LPR Acquisition, which was completed on September 3, 2024. With respect to acquisitions, organic changes exclude the operating results of an acquired entity during the first 12 months following the date of acquisition. 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our operating results, as Liberty Costa Rica and certain entities within C W have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The impacts to the various components of our results of operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted below. For information concerning our foreign currency risks and applicable foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Rates below. 
 The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100 of the revenue and expenses of each segment and our corporate operations. As we have the ability to control certain subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, we include 100 of the revenue and expenses of these entities in our condensed consolidated statements of operations despite the fact that third parties own significant interests in these entities. The noncontrolling owners interests in the operating results of (i) certain subsidiaries of C W and Liberty Puerto Rico, and (ii) Liberty Costa Rica are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to certain costs and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to costs and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of our reportable segments. Any cost increases that we are not able to pass on to our subscribers would result in increased pressure on our operating margins.

For further discussion and analysis of changes in Depreciation and amortization , and Impairment, Restructuring and other operating items, net , see Results of Operations (below Adjusted OIBDA) sections below. 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted OIBDA 
 On a consolidated basis, Adjusted OIBDA is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is the primary measure used by our CODM to evaluate segment operating performance. Adjusted OIBDA is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to determine how to allocate resources to segments. Our internal decision makers believe Adjusted OIBDA is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (i) readily view operating trends, (ii) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (iii) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. We believe our Adjusted OIBDA measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies. Adjusted OIBDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss, net earnings or loss and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or loss. 
 
 A reconciliation of total operating income (loss), the nearest U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted OIBDA on a consolidated basis, is presented below.

Adjusted OIBDA Margin 
 The following table sets forth the Adjusted OIBDA Margin of each of our reportable segments:

 Adjusted OIBDA Margin is impacted by organic changes in revenue, programming and other direct costs of services and other operating costs and expenses. We incurred aggregate integration costs (i) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1 million and 17 million, respectively, within our Liberty Puerto Rico segment, and (ii) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 3 million and 13 million, respectively, within our Liberty Puerto Rico, Liberty Costa Rica and C W Panama segments. 
 
 Revenue 
 Most of our segments derive their revenue primarily from (i) residential fixed services, including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony, (ii) mobile services and (iii) B2B enterprise services. Liberty Networks also provides wholesale services over its subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks. 
 While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in revenue, we experience significant competition in all of our markets. Competition has an adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our (i) RGUs, (ii) ARPU and/or (iii) B2B revenue. 
 Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of RGUs or mobile subscribers during the period and (ii) changes in ARPU. Changes in ARPU can be attributable to (i) changes in prices, (ii) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (iii) changes in the tier of services selected, (iv) variances in subscriber usage patterns and (v) the overall mix of fixed and mobile products during the period. In the following discussion, we discuss ARPU changes in terms of the net impact of the above factors on the ARPU that is derived from our video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile products. 
 
 The following tables set forth the organic and non-organic changes in revenue by reportable segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023.

 The details of the changes in C W Caribbean s revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023, are set forth below (in millions): 
 Three-month comparison Nine-month comparison Increase (decrease) in residential fixed subscription revenue due to change in: Average number of RGUs (a) (0.9) 1.1 ARPU (b) (2.1) 1.1 Decrease in residential fixed non-subscription revenue (0.7) (0.6) Total increase (decrease) in residential fixed revenue (3.7) 1.6 Increase in residential mobile service revenue (c) 8.0 19.1 Decrease in residential mobile interconnect, inbound roaming, equipment sales and other revenue (0.3) (1.2) Increase (decrease) in B2B revenue (d) (3.1) 6.4 Total organic increase 0.9 25.9 Impact of FX (1.9) (4.5) Total (1.0) 21.4 
 
 (a) The changes are primarily due to the net effect of higher average broadband internet RGUs and lower average video RGUs. During the three-month comparison, the impact of lower average video RGUs was greater than the impact of higher average broadband internet RGUs. 
 (b) The changes are primarily due to the net impact of (i) higher ARPU from broadband internet services, mainly due to price increases, (ii) lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services, mostly due to Hurricane Beryl-related rebates and fixed-mobile convergence efforts, and (iii) lower ARPU from video services. During the three-month comparison, the impact of lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services and video services more than offset the impact of higher ARPU from broadband internet services. 
 (c) The increases are primarily attributable to the net impact of (i) higher average numbers of postpaid mobile subscribers, mostly due to growth from fixed-mobile convergence efforts, (ii) increases in prepaid ARPU resulting from price increases implemented during the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, and (iii) lower average numbers of prepaid mobile subscribers. 
 (d) The increase during the nine-month comparison is mainly attributable to higher project-related revenue across various markets. The decrease during the three-month comparison is mainly driven by a decrease in fixed and managed services, mostly due to impacts related to Hurricane Beryl.

 Three-month comparison Nine-month comparison Increase (decrease) in residential fixed subscription revenue due to change in: Average number of RGUs (a) 2.7 7.9 ARPU (b) (1.1) (2.8) Decrease in residential fixed non-subscription revenue (0.2) (0.6) Total increase in residential fixed revenue 1.4 4.5 Increase in residential mobile service revenue (c) 4.5 3.4 Increase in residential mobile interconnect, inbound roaming, equipment sales and other revenue (d) 2.4 2.5 Increase (decrease) in B2B revenue (e) (10.7) 7.5 Total (2.4) 17.9 
 
 (a) The increases are primarily due to higher average broadband internet RGUs. 
 (b) The decreases are primarily due to lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony and video services, mainly driven by higher discounts and the migration of customers to lower ARPU plans. 
 (c) The increases are primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher ARPU from prepaid mobile services, (ii) lower average numbers of prepaid mobile subscribers, and (iii) higher average numbers of postpaid mobile subscribers. The decreases in prepaid mobile subscribers are driven by the net impact of churn related to the migration of customers to our network following the Claro Panama Acquisition, and the addition of customers to our base following the exit of a competitor from our market. The increases in prepaid mobile ARPU are primarily due to higher ARPU packages offered to customers. 
 (d) The increases are primarily due to higher volumes of handset sales. 
 (e) The increase during the nine-month comparison is primarily due to (i) higher revenue from government-related projects and (ii) higher revenue from fixed and managed services, primarily broadband internet services. During the three-month comparison, the increase in revenue from fixed and managed services was more than offset by a decrease in revenue from government-related projects, mainly driven by the phasing of projects that were previously approved but for which delivery and installation have not yet occurred.

 Personnel and contract labor: The decrease during the nine month comparison is primarily due to lower headcount levels following the execution of certain restructuring plans. 
 Commercial: The increases are primarily due to higher marketing and commissions expense associated with efforts to obtain customers from a competitor following their exit from the market. 
 Facility, provision, franchise and other: The decreases are primarily due to (i) lower facilities costs, mainly from synergies attained following the Claro Panama Acquisition and (ii) lower bad debt expense.

 Network-related: The increases are primarily due to higher maintenance costs. 
 Service-related: The increases are primarily due to higher outsourcing and software upgrade expenses. 
 Facility, provision, franchise and other: The increases are primarily due to higher bad debt expense, mostly driven by adjustments for two large customers during the second and third quarters of 2024.

 Personnel and contract labor: The organic increase for the nine-month comparison is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases resulting from the receipt of payroll tax credits during the first and second quarters of 2023 awarded to businesses that continued to pay employees or that experienced significant declines in gross receipts during the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) higher salaries and related personnel costs, (iii) higher severance-related expenses and (iv) lower bonus-related expenses. 
 Network-related: The organic decreases are primarily due to the termination of a transition service agreement during the first half of 2024. 
 Service-related: The organic increases are primarily due to (i) higher service-related integration costs associated with the migration of customers to our mobile network following the AT T Acquisition and (ii) increases in information technology service and license expenses, as we have transitioned mobile customers acquired from AT T to our internal systems. 
 Commercial: The organic increase for the nine-month comparison is primarily due to higher call center costs. 
 Facility, provision, franchise and other: The organic changes are primarily due to the net effect of (i) higher bad debt expense impacted by billing and collection issues experienced during and following the migration of customers to our mobile network and associated systems, (ii) increased collection costs and (iii) decreases due to the substantial termination of a transition services agreement during the first half of 2024.

 Personnel and contract labor: The organic decrease during the nine-month comparison is primarily due to lower salaries and related personnel costs driven by a reduction in headcount associated with restructuring plans. During the three-month comparison, the increase is driven by (i) higher bonus costs and (ii) higher salaries due to an increase in headcount. 
 Network-related: The organic decreases are primarily due to the net impact of (i) higher maintenance costs, (ii) lower power costs, and (iii) lower subsea capacity charges. 
 Facility, provision, franchise and other: The organic increases are primarily due to (i) increases in bad debt expense, mainly associated with installment receivables on equipment sales, and (ii) higher operating lease expense associated with an increase in tower leases.

 Personnel and contract labor: The increases are primarily due to (i) higher bonus-related expense and (ii) lower capitalized labor. 
 Service-related: The changes are primarily due to the net effect of higher professional services costs and other insignificant changes across other service-related cost categories. 
 Facility, provision, franchise and other: The decrease during the nine-month comparison is primarily due to insurance costs recognized during 2023 associated with (i) cable breaks that occurred during the first quarter of 2023 and (ii) business interruption claims submitted by our Liberty Puerto Rico business during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations (below Adjusted OIBDA) 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Our depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 million or 6 and 24 million or 3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases are primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases in property and equipment additions, primarily associated with baseline-related additions, the installation of CPE and the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives and (ii) decreases associated with customer relationship assets becoming fully amortized in C W Panama.

 (a) The 2024 amounts primarily relate to the impairment of the goodwill balance at Liberty Puerto Rico, as further described in note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The 2023 amounts primarily relate to the impairment of certain operating lease right-of-use assets, predominantly related to decommissioned tower leases at C W Panama. 
 (b) Amounts primarily include employee severance and termination costs related to reorganization activities at (i) C W Panama for the 2024 periods, and (ii) C W Caribbean and C W Panama for the 2023 periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amount also includes reorganization activities at Liberty Puerto Rico. 
 (c) Amounts primarily include the net effect of direct acquisition costs and gains on asset dispositions. 
 
 Interest expense 
 Our interest expense increased 7 million and 23 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increases are primarily attributable to (i) increases in our average outstanding debt balances, mainly driven by debt associated with the Tower Transactions and the activity during 2024 on our revolving credit facilities, and (ii) for the nine-month comparison, higher weighted-average interest rates. 
 For additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, including the Tower Transactions, see note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 It is possible that the interest rates on (i) any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates on our existing indebtedness and (ii) our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future periods. As further discussed in note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks. 
 64 

Realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, net 
 Our realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments primarily include (i) unrealized changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments that are non-cash in nature until such time as the derivative contracts are fully or partially settled and (ii) realized gains or losses upon the full or partial settlement of the derivative contracts. The details of our realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, are as follows:

 (a) The gains (losses) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and, for the 2024 periods, the impact of amendments to certain interest rate derivative contracts within our C W and Liberty Puerto Rico borrowing groups. 
 (b) The losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are primarily attributable to changes in FX rates due to the value of the CRC relative to the U.S. dollar. 
 (c) Amounts represent the amortization of premiums associated with our Weather Derivatives and, for the 2024 periods, a net gain associated with the receipt of 44 million in net third-party proceeds from the Hurricane Beryl settlement, as further described in note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 For additional information concerning our derivative instruments, see notes 3 and 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk below. 
 
 Foreign currency transaction gains or losses, net 
 Our foreign currency transaction gains or losses primarily result from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable entity. Unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses are computed based on period-end exchange rates and are non-cash in nature until such time as the amounts are settled. The details of our foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net, are as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 in millions U.S. dollar-denominated debt issued by non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities (a) 5.3 7.2 1.2 39.9 Intercompany payables and receivables denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency

 (a) The changes are primarily related to a CRC functional currency entity. 
 (b) Primarily includes (i) third-party receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency and (ii) cash denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency. 
 65 

Gains or losses on debt extinguishment, net 
 Our gains or losses on debt extinguishment generally include (i) premiums or discounts associated with redemptions and/or repurchases of debt, (ii) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, premiums and/or discounts and/or (iii) breakage fees. 
 We recognized gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, net, of nil and 0.3 million) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.3 million and 4 million) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is associated with the repurchase of the Convertible Notes. The activity during the 2023 periods is due to the net effect of (i) losses associated with refinancing activity at Liberty Costa Rica during January 2023 and (ii) net gains during the three and nine month periods associated with the partial repurchase of the Convertible Notes. 
 For additional information concerning our debt repurchases and repayments, see note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Income tax benefit or expense 
 We recognized income tax benefit (expense) of 146 million and 10 million) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 177 million and 52 million) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income tax benefit attributable to our loss before income taxes differs from the amounts computed using the statutory tax rate, primarily due to the beneficial effects of international rate differences, net decreases in valuation allowances and permanent tax differences, such as non-taxable income. These beneficial effects were partially offset by the detrimental effects of non-deductible goodwill impairment, permanent tax differences, such as non-deductible expenses and inclusion of withholding taxes on cross-border payments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax benefit reflects our estimate of global minimum tax which has been reduced for changes in legislative landscape and updated current and forecasted operating results. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax benefit reflects effects of net legislative increase to the statutory tax rate in Barbados and the net detrimental effects of the inclusion of global minimum tax. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the income tax expense attributable to our earnings before income taxes differs from the amounts computed using the statutory tax rate, primarily due to the detrimental effects of net increases in valuation allowances, negative effects of permanent tax differences, such as non-deductible expenses and inclusion of withholding taxes on cross-border payments. These negative impacts to our effective tax rate were partially offset by the beneficial effects of international rate differences and permanent tax differences, such as non-taxable income. 
 For additional information regarding our income taxes, see note 15 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Net earnings or loss 
 The following table sets forth selected summary financial information of our net earnings (loss): 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 in millions Operating income (loss) (379.6) 162.7 (176.0) 404.7 Net non-operating expenses (195.2) (104.4) (467.0) (356.9) Income tax benefit (expense) 145.7 (10.4) 176.5 (51.9) Net earnings (loss) (429.1) 47.9 (466.5) (4.1) 
 Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments and (ii) movements in foreign currency exchange rates are subject to a high degree of volatility and, as such, any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the absence of significant gains in the future from these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to achieve earnings is largely dependent on our ability to increase our aggregate Adjusted OIBDA to a level that 
 66 

more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (i) share-based compensation and other Employee Incentive Plan-related expense, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) impairment, restructuring and other operating items, (iv) interest expense, (v) other non-operating expenses and (vi) income tax expenses. 
 Due largely to the fact that we seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns, as discussed under Material Changes in Financial Condition Capitalization below, we expect that we will continue to report significant levels of interest expense for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Material Changes in Financial Condition 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have three primary borrowing groups, which include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities of C W, Liberty Puerto Rico and Liberty Costa Rica. Our borrowing groups, which typically generate cash from operating activities, held a significant portion of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024. Our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling interests, foreign currency exchange restrictions with respect to certain C W subsidiaries and other factors. For details of the restrictions on our subsidiaries to make payments to us through dividends, loans or other distributions see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 The details of the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 are set forth in the following table (in millions): 
 Cash and cash equivalents held by: Liberty Latin America and unrestricted subsidiaries: Liberty Latin America (a) 12.1 Unrestricted subsidiaries (b) 62.1 Total Liberty Latin America and unrestricted subsidiaries 74.2 Borrowing groups (c): C W (d) 479.0 Liberty Puerto Rico 26.7 Liberty Costa Rica 8.7 Total borrowing groups 514.4 Total cash and cash equivalents 
 588.6 
 (a) Represents the amount held by Liberty Latin America on a standalone basis. 
 (b) Represents the aggregate amount held by subsidiaries of Liberty Latin America that are outside of our borrowing groups. All of these companies rely on funds provided by our borrowing groups to satisfy their liquidity needs. 
 (c) Represents the aggregate amounts held by the parent entity of the applicable borrowing group and their restricted subsidiaries. 
 (d) Includes 91 million and 45 million of cash held by operations in C W Panama and C W Bahamas, respectively. 
 Liquidity and capital resources of Liberty Latin America and its unrestricted subsidiaries 
 Our current sources of corporate liquidity include (i) cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Latin America and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, Liberty Latin America s unrestricted subsidiaries, and (ii) interest and dividend income received on our and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and investments. From time to time, Liberty Latin America and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also receive (i) proceeds in the form of distributions or loan repayments from Liberty Latin America s borrowing groups upon (a) the completion of recapitalizations, refinancings, asset sales or similar transactions by these entities or (b) the accumulation of excess cash from operations or other means, (ii) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets of Liberty Latin America and its unrestricted subsidiaries and (iii) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt by Liberty Latin America or its unrestricted subsidiaries or the issuance of equity securities by Liberty Latin America. No assurance can be given that any 
 67 

external funding would be available to Liberty Latin America or its unrestricted subsidiaries on favorable terms, or at all. As noted above, various factors may limit our ability to access the cash of our borrowing groups. 
 Our corporate liquidity requirements include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses and (ii) other liquidity needs that may arise from time to time. In addition, Liberty Latin America and its unrestricted subsidiaries may require cash in connection with (i) the repayment of third-party and intercompany debt, (ii) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (iii) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (iv) the repurchase of debt securities, (v) tax payments or (vi) any funding requirements of our consolidated subsidiaries. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the aggregate value of our share repurchases was 83 million. For additional information regarding our Share Repurchase Program, see note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and Part II Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds below. 
 Liquidity and capital resources of borrowing groups 
 The cash and cash equivalents of our borrowing groups are detailed in the table above. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the primary sources of liquidity of our borrowing groups are cash provided by operations and borrowing availability under their respective debt instruments. For the details of the borrowing availability of our borrowing groups at September 30, 2024, see note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. The aforementioned sources of liquidity may be supplemented in certain cases by contributions and/or loans from Liberty Latin America and its unrestricted subsidiaries. The liquidity of our borrowing groups generally is used to fund capital expenditures, debt service requirements and income tax payments. From time to time, our borrowing groups may also require liquidity in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (ii) loans to Liberty Latin America, (iii) capital distributions to Liberty Latin America and other equity owners or (iv) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to our borrowing groups on favorable terms, or at all. 
 For additional information regarding our cash flows, see the discussion under Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below. 
 Capitalization 
 We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. When it is cost effective, we generally seek to match the denomination of the borrowings of our subsidiaries with the functional currency of the operations that support the respective borrowings. As further discussed under Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and in note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we also use derivative instruments to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risks associated with our debt instruments. 
 Our ability to service or refinance our debt and, where applicable, to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain covenant EBITDA of our operating subsidiaries, as specified by our subsidiaries debt agreements Covenant EBITDA ), and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by incurrence-based and/or maintenance-based leverage covenants contained in the various debt instruments of our borrowing groups. For example, if the Covenant EBITDA of one of our borrowing groups were to decline, our ability to support or obtain additional debt in that borrowing group could be limited. No assurance can be given that we would have sufficient sources of liquidity, or that any external funding would be available on favorable terms, or at all, to fund any such required repayment. At September 30, 2024, each of our borrowing groups was in compliance with its debt covenants. We do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance with respect to the debt covenants of our borrowing groups that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity during the next 12 months. 
 At September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal amount of our debt, together with our finance lease obligations, aggregated 8,212 million, including (i) 550 million that is classified as current in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and (ii) 7,604 million that is not due until 2027 or thereafter. All of our debt and finance lease obligations have been borrowed or incurred by our subsidiaries at September 30, 2024. Included in the outstanding principal amount of our debt at September 30, 2024 is (i) 325 million of vendor financing obligations, which we use to finance certain of our operating expenses and property and equipment additions and are generally due within one year, other than for certain licensing arrangements that generally are due over the term of the related license, and (ii) 245 million of finance obligations related to the Tower Transactions. For additional information concerning our debt, including our debt maturities, see note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 68 

The weighted average interest rate in effect at September 30, 2024 for all borrowings outstanding pursuant to each debt instrument, including any applicable margin, was 7.2 . The interest rate is based on stated rates and does not include the impact of derivative instruments, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. The weighted average impact of the derivative instruments on our borrowing costs at September 30, 2024 was as follows: 
 Borrowing group Decrease to borrowing costs C W (1.5) Liberty Puerto Rico (0.7) Liberty Costa Rica Liberty Latin America borrowing groups (1.1) 
 Including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts, and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs, the weighted average interest rate on our indebtedness was 6.1 at September 30, 2024. 
 W e believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and finance lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our debt maturities grow in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is difficult to predict how political, economic and social conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments will impact the credit and equity markets we access and our future financial position. Our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely impacted by (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties, which could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution, and (ii) tightening of the credit markets. In addition, any weakness in the equity markets could make it less attractive to use our shares to satisfy contingent or other obligations, and sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity. 
 
 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
 General. Our cash flows are subject to variations due to FX. 
 Summary. Our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized as follows: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change in millions Net cash provided by operating activities 357.7 506.5 (148.8) Net cash used by investing activities (513.3) (452.5) (60.8) Net cash used by financing activities (233.5) (254.9) 21.4 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (6.2) (5.3) (0.9) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (395.3) (206.2) (189.1) 
 Operating Activities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decline in Adjusted OIBDA, (ii) higher payments for interest, (iii) higher payments for taxes and (iv) a net increase from other working capital-related items, which includes 44 million in proceeds that resulted from a claim pursuant to our Weather Derivatives in connection with Hurricane Beryl. 
 Investing Activities. The cash used by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to (i) capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and (ii) the purchase of additional investments. Cash used during 2024 also includes the first installment payment for the LPR Acquisition, as further described in note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 69 

The capital expenditures, net, that we report in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, which relates to cash paid for property and equipment, do not include amounts that are financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements. Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid. In this discussion, we refer to (i) our capital expenditures, net, as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, and (ii) our total property and equipment additions, which include our capital expenditures, net, on an accrual basis and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements. 
 A reconciliation of our property and equipment additions to our capital expenditures, net, as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, is set forth below: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 in millions Property and equipment additions 485.2 524.3 Assets acquired under capital-related vendor financing arrangements (117.5) (117.7) Changes in current liabilities related to capital expenditures and other 9.0 16.3 Capital expenditures, net 376.7 422.9 
 The decrease in our property and equipment additions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023, is primarily due to decreases related to CPE and baseline additions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our property and equipment additions represented 14.7 and 15.7 of revenue, respectively. 
 Financing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 234 million in cash for financing activities, primarily due to (i) 151 million in net debt repayments, (ii) 83 million of cash outflows associated with the repurchase of Liberty Latin America common shares, (iii) 43 million of net cash inflows related to derivative instruments, primarily related to the amendment of certain interest rate derivative contracts at C W Caribbean and Liberty Puerto Rico, and (iv) 23 million in payments related to distributions to a noncontrolling interest owner in C W Bahamas and C W Panama. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 255 million of cash for financing activities, primarily due to (i) 111 million in cash outflows associated with the repurchase of Liberty Latin America common shares, (ii) 99 million in net debt repayments, (iii) 41 million in payments related to distributions to noncontrolling interest owners in C W Panama and C W Bahamas, and (iv) 15 million of payments for financing costs and debt premiums, primarily associated with refinancing activity at Liberty Costa Rica. For additional information regarding our financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, see note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may provide (i) indemnifications to our lenders, our vendors and certain other parties and (ii) performance and/or financial guarantees to local municipalities, our customers and vendors. Historically, these arrangements have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not believe that they will result in material payments in the future. 
 Contractual Commitments 
 For information concerning our operating lease obligations and debt, see notes 9 and 10, respectively, to our condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, we have commitments under (i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For information regarding projected cash flows associated with our derivative instruments, see Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivative Instruments below . For information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, see note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information concerning our other contractual commitments, see note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion that appears under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our investments in various countries and ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. As further described below, we have established policies, procedures and processes governing our management of market risks and the use of derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. 
 Cash and Investments 
 We invest our cash in highly liquid instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We are exposed to exchange rate risk to the extent that the denominations of our cash and cash equivalent balances, revolving lines of credit and other short-term sources of liquidity do not correspond to the denominations of Liberty Latin America s short-term liquidity requirements. In order to mitigate this risk, we actively manage the denominations of our cash balances in consideration of Liberty Latin America s forecasted liquidity requirements. 
 Foreign Currency Rates 
 The relationships between the (i) CRC and JMD and (ii) the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, are shown below, per one U.S. dollar: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Spot rates: CRC 519.80 523.04 JMD 157.26 154.35 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average rates: CRC 523.03 540.17 517.01 547.80 JMD 156.51 153.81 155.42 153.22 
 Interest Rate Risks 
 In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt. Accordingly, we have entered into various derivative transactions to reduce exposure to increases in interest rates. We use interest rate derivative contracts to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest rates calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. At September 30, 2024, we paid a fixed or capped rate of interest on 95 of our total debt, which includes the impact of our interest rate derivative contracts. The final maturity dates of our various portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments match the respective maturities of the underlying variable-rate debt. In this regard, we use judgment to determine the appropriate maturity dates of our portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments, taking into account the relative costs and benefits of different maturity profiles in light of current and expected future market conditions, liquidity issues and other factors. For additional information concerning the impacts of these interest rate derivative instruments, see note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Sensitivity Information 
 Information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes in market conditions is set forth below. The potential changes in fair value set forth below do not include any amounts associated with the remeasurement of the derivative asset or liability into the applicable functional currency. For additional information, see notes 3 and 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 71 

C W Interest Rate Derivative Contracts 
 Holding all other factors constant, at September 30, 2024, an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 100 basis points (1.0 would have increased (decreased) the aggregate fair value of the C W interest rate derivative contracts by approximately 61 million 61 million). 
 Liberty Puerto Rico Interest Rate Derivative Contracts 
 Holding all other factors constant, at September 30, 2024, an instantaneous increase (decrease) in the relevant base rate of 100 basis points (1.0 would have increased (decreased) the aggregate fair value of the Liberty Puerto Rico interest rate derivative contracts by approximately 20 million 18 million). 
 Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivative Instruments 
 The following table provides information regarding the projected cash flows associated with our derivative instruments. The U.S. dollar equivalents presented below are based on interest rates and exchange rates that were in effect as of September 30, 2024. These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes only and will likely differ from the actual cash payments or receipts required in future periods.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Executives, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Executives recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and objectives. 
 As disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable new or enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. Our management, with the participation of the Executives, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. As remediation is not completed, the Executives concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures continue to be ineffective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Management s Remediation Plans 
 Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, is continuing to implement the remediation plans as disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. We believe that these actions and the improvements we expect to achieve, when fully implemented, will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weaknesses identified. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as listed below, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 During the quarter, we made the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting: 
 designed and implemented additional manual procedures and controls to enhance our internal control process through a combination of preventative and detective controls, and 
 held trainings to reinforce control concepts and responsibilities for control performers.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, our subsidiaries and affiliates have become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of their operations in the normal course of business. For additional information, see note 17 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 On May 8, 2023, our Directors approved 200 million for the repurchase of our Class A common shares and/or Class C common shares under the Share Repurchase Program through December 2025. On May 7, 2024, our Directors authorized us to repurchase from time to time up to an additional 200 million of our Class A common shares and/or Class C common shares under the Share Repurchase Program through December 2026 through open market purchases at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades, derivative transactions and/or through other legally permissible means. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any of our Class A or C common shares. During June 2024, we entered into capped call option contracts, pursuant to which we have purchased capped call options on a number of Class A and Class C common shares, which can result in the receipt of cash or shares at our election. For information about our capped call option contracts, see note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 There were no repurchases of our Class A or C common shares during the three months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program was 242 million, which is net of the premium associated with the capped call option contracts. 
 
 Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION

The Issuer and the Trustee may charge for their expenses in replacing a Note, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel. In the event any such mutilated, lost, destroyed or stolen Note has become or is about to become due and payable, the Issuer in its discretion may pay such Note instead of issuing a new Note in replacement thereof.

 If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.08, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser. 
 If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue. 
 If the Paying Agent (other than the Issuer, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a Redemption Date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes will be deemed to be no longer outstanding and will cease to accrue interest.

 71 

determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded. 
 Section 2.11 Temporary Notes 
 Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Issuer may prepare and the Authenticating Agent, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will authenticate temporary Notes.

 118 

covenants then applicable will require reversal or constitute a Default under this Indenture or the Notes in the event that suspended covenants are subsequently reinstated or suspended, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain a listing (whether on the International Stock Exchange or on another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers) if such listing is not required for the Issuer to benefit from an exemption on withholding tax on interest payments on the Notes or to otherwise prevent tax from being withheld from interest payments on the Notes.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by Law. 
 Section 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults

Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 
 Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all Losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. 
 Section 6.05 Control by Majority 
 Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it.

 The Trustee may make reasonable rules for action by or at a meeting of Holders. The Notes Registrar or Paying Agent may make reasonable rules and set reasonable requirements for its functions. 
 Section 14.06 No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders 
 No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or stockholder of the Issuer, the Company, the Affiliate Issuer, the Guarantors, any of their respective parent companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, the Company, the Affiliate Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, this Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.

 Section 14.07 Currency Indemnity 
 The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer with respect to this Indenture or the Notes under this Indenture is dollars. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than dollars (whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Company, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee, security agent or a Holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Issuer only to the extent of the dollar amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If that dollar amount is less than the dollar amount expressed to be due to the recipient under this Indenture or any Note, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such purchase. 
 For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for the Holder, the Trustee or any other Person to certify that it would have suffered a loss had an actual purchase of dollars been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of dollars on such date had not been practicable, on the first date on which it would have been practicable). These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations of the Issuer, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by the Trustee, security agent or a Holder and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under this Indenture or any Note or any other judgment or order.

Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than (1) 1 00 p.m. two Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans or any conversion of Loans from one Type to another, and (2) 1 00 p.m. on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans provided that the notice referred to in Section 2.02(a)(1) may be delivered no later than one Business Day prior to the requested date of the Borrowing in the case of the initial Revolving Credit Borrowing and the initial Term B-5 Borrowing. Except as provided in Sections 2.15 or 2.16, or as otherwise specified in an Additional Facility Joinder Agreement in relation to any Additional Facility, each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of 1,000,000 or a whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof.

The currency specified in a Committed Loan Notice for an Additional Facility must be an Available Currency. If, (A) with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loans and SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars, a Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans and (B) with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Loans and SOFR Loans denominated in any Available Currency (other than Dollars), a Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, as applicable, with an Interest Period of one month.

Administrative Agent s Office not later than the later of 12 00 noon on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice and one hour after written notice of such Borrowing is delivered by the Administrative Agent to such Lender provided that such funds may be made available at such earlier time as may be agreed among the relevant Lenders, the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent for the purposes of the relevant transactions. The Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the relevant Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account(s) of the relevant Borrower on the books of the Administrative Agent with the amount of such funds or (ii) the wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided by the relevant Borrower to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent provided that if there are Swing Line Loans or L C Borrowings outstanding on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to a Borrowing under any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments is given by the relevant Borrower, then the proceeds of such Borrowing shall be applied, first, to the payment in full of any such L C Borrowing, second, to the payment in full of any such Swing Line Loans, and third, to the relevant Borrower as provided above. 
 (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, (i) a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan unless the relevant Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.10 in connection therewith and (ii) a SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such SOFR Loan unless the relevant Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under Section 3.10 in connection therewith. During the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require by notice to the Borrowers that no Loans denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans and Loans denominated in an Available Currency other than Dollars may only be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans with an Interest Period of one month. 
 (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, as applicable, upon determination of such interest rate.

At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the relevant Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Administrative Agent s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change. 
 (e) After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to another, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect unless otherwise agreed between the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent provided that , after the establishment of any new Class of Loans pursuant to an Additional Facility Joinder Agreement, a Refinancing Amendment or Extension Amendment, the number of Interest Periods otherwise permitted by this Section 2.02(e) shall increase by three Interest Periods for each applicable Class so established. 
 (f) The failure of any Lender to make a Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 
 (g) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(b), and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the relevant Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the relevant Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing, or 
 55 

similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the foregoing. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.02(g) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If the relevant Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the relevant Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the relevant Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the relevant Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the relevant Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. 
 (h) Upon receipt of a Committed Loan Notice for an Additional Facility, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Additional Facility Lender of the aggregate amount of the Additional Facility Borrowing and of the amount of such Additional Facility Lender s Pro Rata Share thereof, which shall be based on their respective Additional Facility Commitment. Each Additional Facility Lender will make the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the Additional Facility Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Borrower at the New York office of the Administrative Agent specified on Schedule 10.02 prior to the time specified in the relevant Additional Facility Joinder Agreement, in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. 
 (i) No more than one Committed Loan Notice may be made under each Additional Facility unless an Additional Facility Joinder Agreement specifies otherwise, in which case the maximum number of requests for Additional Facility Loans under that Additional Facility will be as set out in that Additional Facility Joinder Agreement. 
 (j) Unless the Administrative Agent agrees otherwise, or unless otherwise agreed in the Additional Facility Joinder Agreement, no more than five Additional Facility Loans may be outstanding at any one time under each Additional Facility (other than Additional Facilities that are Revolving Credit Loans). 
 (k) After the Transition Date, (i) no Borrower may request any Borrowing or continuation of, or a conversion into, Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars and (ii) no provision of this Agreement shall be construed so as to permit any automatic conversions into, or continuations of, Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars.

 (C) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing because the conditions set forth in Section 4.03 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the relevant L C Issuer an L C Borrowing in the Dollar Equivalent of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Appropriate Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i)(B) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L C Borrowing and shall constitute an L C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03. 
 (D) Until each Appropriate Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such amount shall be solely for the account of the relevant L C Issuer. 
 (E) Each Participating Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L C Advances to reimburse an L C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c)(i), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (1) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the relevant L C Issuer, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever (2) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Article IV (3) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Loan Parties (4) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L C Issuer or (5) any other circumstance, occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing provided that each Participating Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.03 (other than delivery by the relevant Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the relevant Borrower to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
 60 

(F) If any Participating Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant L C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c)(i) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(i)(B), such L C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the relevant L C Issuer submitted to any Participating Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(i)(F) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (ii) With respect to any Alternative Letter of Credit 
 (A) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Alternative Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Alternative Letter of Credit, the relevant Alternative L C Issuer shall notify promptly the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 12 00 noon on the second Business Day following any payment by an Alternative L C Issuer under an Alternative Letter of Credit with notice to that Borrower, that Borrower shall reimburse such Alternative L C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing in Dollars (it being understood that in the case of an Alternative Letter of Credit denominated in an Available Currency other than Dollars, the amount of such Alternative Letter of Credit shall be determined by taking the Dollar Equivalent, calculated by the Administrative Agent, of such Alternative Letter of Credit) provided that if such reimbursement is not made on the date of drawing, such Borrower shall pay interest to the relevant Alternative L C Issuer on such amount at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans (in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars), Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, as applicable, with an Interest Period of one month (in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Available Currency other than Dollars) under the applicable Revolving Credit Commitments (without duplication of interest payable on Alternative L C Borrowings). The Alternative L C Issuer shall notify the applicable Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent amount of the drawing promptly following the determination or revaluation thereof (such amount, the Drawn Amount ). Any notice given by an Alternative L C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(ii)(A) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (B) A Borrower may elect to fund all or part of any Drawn Amount by way of a Revolving Credit Borrowing. For the purposes of any such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (1) such Borrower shall, at the same time as it delivers a Request for Credit Extension in respect thereof, notify the Administrative Agent that the Revolving Credit Borrowing is for the purpose of funding the applicable Borrower s reimbursement obligations in respect of such Drawn Amount, and (2) for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Credit Lender that has issued the Alternative Letter of Credit under which such Drawn Amount is payable, the participation of such Revolving Credit Lender in such Alternative Letter of Credit shall not be deducted from such Revolving Credit Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment under such Facility and such Revolving Credit Lender s Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Credit Borrowing under such Facility shall be treated as if applied in or towards repayment of the Drawn Amount so that such Revolving Credit Lender will not be required to make a cash payment under Section 2.12 in respect of its participation in the relevant Revolving Credit Borrowing under such Facility to the extent such Revolving Credit Borrowing is in an amount not exceeding such Drawn Amount. 
 (d) Repayment of Participations in respect of Letters of Credit. 
 (i) If, at any time after an L C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Participating Revolving Credit Lender such Lender s L C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c)(i), the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the relevant Borrower or any other Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share or 
 61 

other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s L C Advance was outstanding) in the Dollar Equivalent received by the Administrative Agent. 
 (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i)(A) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such L C Issuer in its discretion), each Appropriate Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L C Issuer its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. 
 (e) Obligations Absolute . The obligation of any Borrower to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, for each drawing under each Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L C Borrowing or Alternative L C Borrowing, as applicable, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following 
 (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto 
 (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that any Loan Party may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction 
 (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit 
 (iv) any payment by the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, under such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit, or any payment made by the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, under such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law 
 (v) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of any Loan Party in respect of such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit or 
 (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Loan Party 
 provided that the foregoing shall not excuse any L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer from liability to each Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential, punitive, special or exemplary damages, claims in respect of which are waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by each Borrower that are caused by such L C Issuer s or Alternative L C Issuer s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. 
 62 

(f) Role of L C Issuers and Alternative L C Issuers . Each Lender and each Borrower agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit, the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L C Issuers or Alternative L C Issuers, as applicable, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Lenders holding a majority of the Participating Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit, Alternative Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. Each Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude a Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L C Issuers or Alternative L C Issuers, as applicable, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of any L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.03(e) provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, a Borrower may have a claim against an L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, and such L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, may be liable to that Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential, punitive or exemplary, damages suffered by that Borrower which that Borrower proves were caused by such L C Issuer s or Alternative L C Issuer s willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence or such L C Issuer s or Alternative L C Issuer s willful, bad faith or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit, in each case as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L C Issuer and Alternative L C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and no L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
 (g) Cash Collateral . (i) If, as of any Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any applicable Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit for any reason remains outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, (ii) if, with respect to any Letter of Credit (but not with respect to any Alternative Letter of Credit) any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Lenders holding a majority of the Participating Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, require the relevant Borrower or any other Borrower to Cash Collateralize the applicable L C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02, (iii) if, with respect to any Alternative Letter of Credit, any Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the relevant Alternative L C Issuer requires the relevant Borrower or any other Borrower to Cash Collateralize the applicable L C Obligations pursuant to Section 8.02, or (iv) if an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs and is continuing, the applicable Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all of its (or, in the case of clause (i), the applicable) L C Obligations (in an amount equal to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the date of such Event of Default or the applicable Letter of Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be), and shall do so not later than 2 00 p.m. on (1) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i) or (ii), (x) the Business Day that a Borrower receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12 00 noon or (y) if clause (x) above does not apply, the Business Day immediately following the day that a Borrower receives such notice and (2) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (iv), the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 8.01(f) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Administrative Agent, an L C Issuer or a Swing Line Lender, the applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). For purposes hereof, Cash Collateralize means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, and (with respect to any Letter of 
 63 

Credit) the Participating Revolving Credit Lenders, as collateral for the relevant L C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances or, if the Administrative Agent and each applicable L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, shall agree, in their sole discretion, other credit support, in each case Cash Collateral pursuant to documentation in form, amount and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable (which documents are hereby consented to by the Appropriate Lenders). Each Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L C Issuers and the Alternative L C Issuers and (with respect to any Letter of Credit) the Participating Revolving Credit Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked accounts at the Administrative Agent or as otherwise permitted under any Intercreditor Agreement, and may be invested in readily available Cash Equivalents. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are expressly subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all relevant L C Obligations, a Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent as aforesaid, an amount equal to the excess of (a) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent reasonably determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the relevant L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable. To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the then Outstanding Amount of such L C Obligations and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the relevant Borrower. To the extent any Event of Default giving rise to the requirement to Cash Collateralize any Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.03(g) is cured or otherwise waived, then so long as no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all Cash Collateral pledged to Cash Collateralize such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit shall be refunded to the relevant Borrower. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and or other obligations secured thereby, the applicable Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. In addition, the Administrative Agent may request at any time and from time to time after the initial deposit of Cash Collateral that additional Cash Collateral be provided by the applicable Borrower in order to protect against the results of exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Letters of Credit or Alternative Letters of Credit denominated in currencies other than Dollars. 
 (h) Letter of Credit and Alternative Letter of Credit Fees. 
 (i) With respect to any Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Participating Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit issued pursuant to this Agreement equal to the Applicable Rate times the daily stated maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit if such maximum amount increases periodically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit) provided that any Letter of Credit fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the relevant L C Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Pro Rata Shares allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.17(a)(iv), with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the relevant L C Issuer for its own account. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be due and payable in the Available Currency in which the applicable Letter of Credit is denominated on the last Business Day of each of March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the applicable Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
 64 

(ii) With respect to any Alternative Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall pay directly to the applicable Alternative L C Issuer such fees as are agreed between the Company and such Alternative L C Issuer. 
 (i) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L C Issuers . With respect to any Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall pay directly to each L C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to such Letter of Credit issued by it equal to 0.125 per annum of the stated maximum Dollar Equivalent amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such amount is then in effect under such Letter of Credit if such maximum amount increases periodically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit) or such other fee as agreed between the Company and the L C Issuer. Such fronting fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fees shall be due and payable in Dollars on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. In addition, the applicable Borrower shall pay directly to each L C Issuer for its own account with respect to each Letter of Credit the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges shall be due and payable within ten Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable. 
 (j) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application . Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or any Letter of Credit Application, in the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit Application, the terms hereof shall control. 
 (k) Addition of an L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer. A Revolving Credit Lender reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Administrative Agent may become an additional L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer hereunder pursuant to a written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent and such Revolving Credit Lender (which agreement shall include the Letter of Credit Sublimit for any such L C Issuer). The Administrative Agent shall notify the Participating Revolving Credit Lenders of any such additional L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer. 
 (l) Reserved. 
 (m) Provisions Related to Extended Revolving Credit Commitments . If the Maturity Date in respect of any Participating Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiry date of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if one or more other Participating Revolving Credit Commitments are then in effect (or will automatically be in effect upon such maturity), such Letter of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Participating Revolving Credit Lenders to purchase participations therein and to make Revolving Credit Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 2.03(c) and (d)) under (and ratably participated in by Participating Revolving Credit Lenders pursuant to) the non-terminating Participating Revolving Credit Commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized Participating Revolving Credit Commitments continuing at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to immediately preceding clause (i) and unless provisions reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L C Issuer for the treatment of such Letter of Credit as a letter of credit under a successor credit facility have been agreed upon, the Company shall, on or prior to the applicable Maturity Date, cause all such Letters of Credit to be replaced and returned to the applicable L C Issuer undrawn and marked cancelled or to the extent that the Company is unable to so replace and return any Letter(s) of Credit, such Letter(s) of Credit shall be secured by a back to back letter of credit reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L C Issuer or the applicable Borrower shall Cash Collateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.03(g). Commencing with the Maturity Date of any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments, unless otherwise set forth herein, the applicable Letter of Credit Sublimit shall be in an amount agreed solely with the applicable L C Issuer. 
 (n) Letter of Credit and Alternative Letter of Credit Reports . For so long as any Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit issued by an L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, is outstanding, such L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent on the last Business Day of each calendar month, and on each date that an L C Credit Extension occurs with respect to any such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit, a report in the form of Exhibit I , appropriately completed 
 65 

with the information for every outstanding Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit issued by such L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable. 
 (o) Letters of Credit and Alternative Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries . Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Loan Party (other than the Borrower), a Permitted Affiliate Parent, an Affiliate Subsidiary or a Subsidiary of a Borrower, such Loan Party, a Permitted Affiliate Parent or an Affiliate Subsidiary, each Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable L C Issuer or Alternative L C Issuer, as applicable, hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit or Alternative Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit or Alternative Letters of Credit for the account of any Loan Party (other than the Borrower), a Permitted Affiliate Parent, any Affiliate Subsidiary or a Subsidiary of the Borrower, such Loan Party, a Permitted Affiliate Parent of an Affiliate Subsidiary inures to the benefit of such Borrower, and that such Borrower s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Loan Party, the Company, such Permitted Affiliate Parent, such Affiliate Subsidiary and such Subsidiaries thereof. 
 (p) Amendments to Alternative Letters of Credit . No amendment or waiver of a term of any Alternative Letter of Credit shall require the consent of any Lender other than the relevant Alternative L C Issuer unless such amendment or waiver itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this Section 2). In such a case, Section 10.01 will apply. 
 Section 2.04. Swing Line Loans . 
 (a) The Swing Line . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans in Dollars to a Borrower under its applicable Revolving Credit Commitment (each such loan, a Swing Line Loan ), from time to time on any Business Day during the period beginning on the Business Day after the date of the establishment hereunder and effectiveness of the relevant Participating Revolving Credit Commitments until the date which is one Business Day prior to the Maturity Date of the Participating Revolving Credit Commitments (taking into account the Maturity Date of any Participating Revolving Credit Commitment that will automatically come into effect on such Maturity Date) in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and L C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender under the applicable Facility, may exceed the amount of the Swing Line Lender s Revolving Credit Commitment provided that, after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan (i) the Revolving Credit Exposure under such Participating Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class shall not exceed the aggregate Participating Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Lender (other than a Swing Line Lender), plus such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations, plus such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans under the applicable Facility shall not exceed such Lender s Participating Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect provided , further , that a Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, a Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Participating Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lenders a risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of (A) such Lender s Pro Rata Share under the applicable Facility or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement and (B) the amount of such Swing Line Loan. 
 (b) Borrowing Procedures . Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon a Borrower s irrevocable notice to the applicable Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone or written Swing Line Loan Notice provided that each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lenders and the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of that Borrower. Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lenders and the Administrative Agent not later than 1 00 p.m. on the requested 
 66 

borrowing date and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of 1,000,000 (or an integral multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof) and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Promptly after receipt by the applicable Swing Line Lenders of any Swing Line Loan Notice (by telephone or in writing), the Swing Line Lenders will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lenders will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lenders have received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 2 00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lenders not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.03 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lenders will not later than 4 00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to that Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Swing Line Lenders shall not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loan at a time when a Participating Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender unless the Swing Line Lenders have entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and the applicable Borrower to eliminate the Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender s or Defaulting Lenders participation in such Swing Line Loans, including by Cash Collateralizing, or obtaining a backstop letter of credit from an issuer reasonably satisfactory to the Swing Line Lenders to support, such Defaulting Lender s or Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Swing Line Loans. A Borrower shall repay to the Swing Line Lenders each Defaulting Lender s portion (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv)) of each Swing Line Loan promptly following demand by the Swing Line Lenders. 
 (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans . 
 (i) A Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of a Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes each Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Participating Revolving Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the amount of Swing Line Loans of that Borrower then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the aggregate Participating Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.03. The applicable Swing Line Lender shall furnish the applicable Borrower with a copy of the applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Participating Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice, which shall be on or after the third Business Day after the date of such notice, available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent s Office not later than 1 00 p.m. on the day specified in such Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Participating Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the applicable Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender. Upon the remittance by the Administrative Agent to the Swing Line Lender of the full amount specified in such Committed Loan Notice, that Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid the applicable Swing Line Loan. 
 (ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by a Swing Line Lender that each of the Participating Revolving Credit Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Participating Revolving Credit Lender s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
 (iii) If any Participating Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on 
 67 

demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. If such Participating Revolving Credit Lender pays such amount, the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Revolving Credit Loan including in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.04(c)(iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (iv) Each Participating Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, a Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or the failure to satisfy any condition in Article IV, (C) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Loan Parties, (D) any breach of this Agreement, or (E) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing provided that each Participating Revolving Credit Lender s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) (but not to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.03. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay the applicable Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (d) Repayment of Participations. 
 (i) At any time after any Participating Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the applicable Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share under the applicable Facility or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender s risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender. 
 (ii) If any payment received by the applicable Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Participating Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share under the applicable Facility or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. 
 (e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender . Each Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the relevant Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Participating Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender. 
 (f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender . A Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the applicable Swing Line Lender. 
 (g) Provisions Related to Extended Revolving Credit Commitments .

 68 

reallocation of Letter of Credit participations as contemplated in Section 2.03(m)) the amount of Swing Line Loans to be reallocated equal to such excess shall be repaid or Cash Collateralized in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Swing Line Lender and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the applicable Borrower shall still be obligated to pay Swing Line Loans allocated to the Participating Revolving Credit Lenders holding the Expiring Credit Commitments at the Maturity Date of the Expiring Credit Commitment or if the Loans have been accelerated prior to the Maturity Date of the Expiring Credit Commitment. 
 (h) Addition of a Swing Line Lender . A Participating Revolving Credit Lender reasonably acceptable to the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent may become an additional Swing Line Lender hereunder pursuant to a written agreement among such Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Participating Revolving Credit Lender (which agreement shall include the Swing Line Sublimit for such additional Swing Line Lender).

 (iv) If any Borrower Incurs or issues any Refinancing Term Loans resulting in net cash proceeds (as opposed to such Refinancing Term Loans arising out of an exchange of existing Term Loans for such Refinancing Term Loans), such Borrower (or the Company on its behalf) shall cause to be prepaid an aggregate principal amount of Term Loans in an amount equal to 100 of all net cash proceeds received therefrom on or prior to the date which is five Business Days after the receipt by such Borrower of such net cash proceeds. 
 (v) If for any reason the aggregate Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans, Swing Line Loans and L C Obligations, in each case under any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments at any time exceeds the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect, the relevant Borrower shall promptly prepay Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans and or Cash Collateralize any L C Obligations under such Class of Revolving Credit Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to such excess provided that such Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize any L C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(v) unless, after giving effect to the prepayment in full of the applicable Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans, the aggregate Outstanding Amount under such Class of Revolving Credit Commitments exceeds the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in effect. 
 (vi) Each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be (A) applied either (x) ratably to each Class of Term Loans then outstanding or (y) as requested by a Borrower in the notice delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(vii), to any Class or Classes of Term Loans, (B) applied, with respect to each such Class for which prepayments will be made, in a manner determined at the discretion of the applicable Borrower in the applicable notice and (C) paid to the Appropriate Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share provided by this Agreement) of each such Class of Term Loans, subject to Section 2.05(b)(vii). Notwithstanding clause (A) hereinabove, (1) in the case of prepayments pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(iv), such prepayment shall be applied in accordance with this Section 2.05(b)(vi) 
 76 

solely to those applicable Classes of Term Loans selected by the applicable Borrower and specified in the applicable Refinancing Amendment or notice (i.e., the applicable Refinanced Debt), and (2) any Additional Facility Joinder Agreement or Extension Amendment, may provide (including on an optional basis as elected by the Borrower) for a less than ratable application of prepayments to any Class of Term Loans established thereunder.

Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the aggregate amount of such prepayment to be made. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the contents of the applicable Borrower s prepayment notice and of such Appropriate Lender s Pro Rata Share of the prepayment.

Each Rejection Notice from a given Lender shall specify the principal amount of the mandatory repayment of Term Loans to be rejected by such Lender. If a Term Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above or such Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount of the mandatory prepayment of Term Loans to be rejected, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of Term Loans. Any Declined Proceeds shall be offered to the Term Lenders not so declining such prepayment on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amounts of the Term Loans of such Lenders (with such non-declining Term Lenders having the right to decline any prepayment with Declined Proceeds at the time and in the manner specified by the Administrative Agent). To the extent such non-declining Term Lenders elect to decline their Pro Rata Share of such Declined Proceeds, any Declined Proceeds remaining thereafter shall be retained by a Borrower. 
 (viii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.05, (A) to the extent that any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a member of the Restricted Group is prohibited or delayed by applicable local Law from being repatriated to the jurisdiction of the relevant Borrower, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in this Section 2.05(b) but may be retained by the applicable member of the Restricted Group so long, but only so long, as the applicable local Law will not permit repatriation to the jurisdiction of the relevant Borrower (each Borrower hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable member of the Restricted Group to promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and once such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, such repatriation will be promptly effected and an amount equal to such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) to the extent provided herein and (B) to the extent that a Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Available Cash of any such Asset Disposition would have material adverse tax consequences (as determined in good faith by such Borrower) with respect to such Net Available Cash, such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in this Section 2.05(b) but may be retained by the applicable member of the Restricted Group.

 (A) the Company or a Permitted Affiliate Parent, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and 
 (B) if the Required Lenders so require, the Administrative Agent shall, by not less than 30 Business Days notice to the Company, cancel each Facility, and the Commitments 
 77 

thereunder and declare all outstanding Borrowings, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued under the Loan Documents immediately due and payable, whereupon each Facility, and the Commitments thereunder, will be cancelled and all such outstanding and accrued amounts will become immediately due and payable. 
 (c) Interest Funding Losses, Etc.

Such deposit shall be deemed to be a prepayment of such Loans by a Borrower for all purposes under this Agreement. 
 Section 2.06. Termination or Reduction of Commitments. 
 (a) Optional . A Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the unused Commitments of any Class, or from time to time permanently reduce the unused Commitments of any Class, in each case without premium or penalty provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction (unless the Administrative Agent agrees to a shorter period in its discretion), (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of 1,000,000, or any whole multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof or, if less, the entire amount thereof and (iii) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Commitments, the applicable Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Participating Revolving Credit Commitments, such sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the amount of any such Revolving Credit Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the applicable Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit unless otherwise specified by a Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Borrower may rescind or postpone any notice of termination of any Commitments if such termination would have resulted from a refinancing of all of the applicable Facility or other conditional event, which refinancing or other event shall not be consummated or otherwise shall be delayed.

The Revolving Credit Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender shall automatically and permanently terminate on the Maturity Date for the applicable Class of Revolving Credit Commitments provided that (x) the foregoing shall not release any Revolving Credit Lender from any liability it may have for its failure to fund Revolving 
 78

All commitment fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 
 (d) Treatment of Classes . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section 2.06, an Initial Borrower may elect, in its discretion, to terminate the unused amount of any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the unused amount of any Class of Revolving Credit Commitments, in accordance with the provisions of clause (a) of this Section 2.06 on a non-pro rata basis with any other Class of Revolving Credit Commitments.

The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

 (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b) or Section 10.07(d), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error provided that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 Section 2.12. Payments Generally.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to payments in an Available Currency (and payments in respect of Alternative Letters of Credit), all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2 00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and with respect to payments in respect of Alternative Letters of Credit, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder in an Available Currency (other than Dollars) shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent s Office in such Available Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than 2 00 p.m. (London time) on the dates specified herein.

The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer (or as otherwise agreed between the Administrative Agent and such Lender) to such Lender s applicable Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2 00 p.m. in the case of Dollars or (ii) after 2 00 pm (London time) in the case of payments in an Available Currency (other than Dollars), shall, in each case, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue to, but excluding, such next succeeding Business Day. Payments owing to an Alternative L C Issuer in respect of reimbursement obligations under an Alternative Letter of Credit shall, to the extent not paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, be made directly by the relevant Borrower to such Alternative L C Issuer. 
 (b) If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall not be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or SOFR Loans, as applicable, to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. 
 (c) Unless a Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrowers or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then 
 (i) if a Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender 
 82 

in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect and 
 (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to a Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrowers with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV or in the applicable Additional Facility Joinder Agreement, Extension Amendment or Refinancing Amendment are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. 
 (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation. 
 (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may (to the fullest extent permitted by mandatory provisions of applicable Law), but shall not be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender s Pro Rata Share or other applicable share provided for under this Agreement of the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of all L C Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender. 
 Section 2.13. Sharing of Payments . If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein or required by court order, any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any principal or interest on account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L C Obligations and Swing Line Loans held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans 
 83 

made by them and or such subparticipations in the participations in L C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of any principal or interest on such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement as in effect from time to time (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant permitted hereunder or (C) any receipt or recovery by a Lender in its capacity as an Alternative L C Issuer at any time prior to the Administrative Agent having exercised any of its rights under Section 8.02 or Section 2.05(b)(ix)(B) (an Acceleration Event provided that, following the occurrence of an Acceleration Event, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all receipts and recoveries by Alternative L C Issuers. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. For purposes of sub-clause (e)(i) of the definition of Indemnified Taxes , a Lender that acquires a participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall be treated as having acquired such participation on the earlier date(s) on which such Lender acquired the applicable interest(s) in the Commitment(s) and or Loan(s) to which such participation relates.

If any Loan Party or other applicable withholding agent shall be required by applicable Laws to make a deduction, (i) if the Tax in question is an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, the sum payable by any Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums paid under this Section 3.01(a)), each Lender (or, in the case of a payment made to the Administrative Agent, an Arranger or a Bookrunner for its own account, the Administrative Agent or such Arranger or Bookrunner) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction been required, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall make such deductions, (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority within the time limit allowed in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment (or, if receipts or evidence are not available within 30 days, as soon as possible thereafter), if any Loan Party is the applicable withholding agent, it shall furnish to such Finance Party (as the case may be) the original or a copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other evidence acceptable to such Finance Party (acting reasonably). 
 (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes and any other excise, property, intangible or mortgage recording Taxes, imposed by any Governmental Authority, which arise from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, from the receipt or perfection of a security interest under or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document, excluding, in each case, any of the following 
 (i) any such Taxes imposed as a result of a Finance Party s Assignment and Assumption, grant of a participation, transfer or assignment to or designation of a new applicable Lending Office or other office for receiving payments under any Loan Document, except where such Assignment and Assumption, participation, transfer, assignment or designation, is requested or required in writing by a Borrower 
 (ii) any such Taxes imposed as a result of a Finance Party voluntarily registering or filing a Loan Document with any Governmental Authority if such registration or filing was not necessary to enforce, prove, maintain or otherwise assert the rights of such Finance Party under a Loan Document and 
 (iii) any increased amount of, or any penalties or interest relating to, such Taxes, to the extent the increase, penalty or interest is incurred as a result of any such Taxes not being paid at the time of the relevant filing or registration of the Loan Document except where such increase or penalties are caused by the unreasonable failure or delay by the Borrower, 
 all such non-excluded taxes described in this Section 3.01(b) being hereinafter referred to as Other Taxes . 
 (c) Each Loan Party agrees to indemnify each Finance Party against (i) the full amount of Indemnified Taxes payable by such Finance Party (including Indemnified Taxes imposed on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01), (ii) Other Taxes payable by such Loan Party pursuant to Section 3.01(b), and (iii) any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the Governmental Authority.

such payment or liability prepared in good faith and delivered by such Finance Party (acting reasonably) (or by Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender) to the Company, accompanied by a written statement thereof setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This Section 3.01(c) shall not be construed to require any Finance Party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Company or any other Person. 
 (d) For the avoidance of doubt this Section 3.01(d) shall not apply in respect of Irish Payments or UK Payments, which are dealt with in Section 3.02. Each Finance Party shall, at such times as are reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, promptly provide that Borrower and the Administrative Agent with any certificate or other properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by that Borrower or the Administrative Agent that establishes, as applicable, whether such Finance Party is eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty or other provision of applicable Law with respect to any payments hereunder to be exempt from, or entitled to a reduced rate of, Tax on payments hereunder. Each such Finance Party shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such documentation obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, deliver promptly and on or before the date such documentation expires, becomes obsolete or inaccurate, to that Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably requested by that Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify that Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its inability to do so. In addition, any Finance Party, if reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by a Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable a Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Finance Party is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Unless the applicable withholding agent has received forms or other documents satisfactory to it indicating that payments under any Loan Document to or for a Finance Party are not subject to withholding Tax or are subject to such Tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty or under any provision of applicable Law, the applicable withholding agent shall withhold amounts required to be withheld by applicable Law from such payments at the applicable statutory rate. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, a Finance Party and any Loan Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in completing any reasonable procedural formalities necessary for that Loan Party to obtain authorization to make a payment to that Finance Party either without a deduction, with a deduction at a reduced Tax rate or at a reduced rate by an applicable tax treaty, including, if applicable, making any necessary registrations or filings with the tax authorities of the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Loan Party. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.01(d), a Finance Party shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 3.01(d) that such Finance Party is not legally eligible to deliver. 
 Without limiting the foregoing

 (ii) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent) whichever of the following is applicable 
 (A) two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, (or any successor forms) claiming eligibility for the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, 
 (B) two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor forms),

 95 

properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, (or any successor forms), 
 (D) to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example, where the Lender is a partnership, or is a Participant holding a participation granted by a participating Lender), IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) of the Lender, accompanied by a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, United States Tax Compliance Certificate, Form W-9, Form W-8IMY or any other required information from each beneficial owner, as applicable provided that, if the Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, the United States Tax Compliance Certificate may be provided by such Lender on behalf of such partner(s)), or 
 (E) two properly completed and duly signed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable U.S. federal income tax laws (including the United States Department of the Treasury Regulations) as a basis for claiming a complete exemption from, or a reduction in, U.S. federal withholding tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents. 
 (iii) Each of the Agent Parties that is a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent two properly completed and duly signed copies of IRS Form W-9 with respect to fees received for its own account, certifying that such Agent Party is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding. Each Agent Party that is not a United States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent two properly completed and duly signed copies of an applicable IRS Form W-8 with respect to fees received for its own account. 
 (e) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Laws and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Laws and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA and, if necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. For purposes of this Section 3.01(e), the term FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, a Loan Party may make any FATCA deduction it is required to make and any payment required in connection with FATCA deduction, and no Loan Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for FATCA. 
 (f) Any Finance Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.01 or a Tax Payment shall use its reasonable efforts to mitigate or reduce the additional amounts payable, which reasonable efforts may include a change of Lending Office (or any other measures reasonably requested by the Company) if such a change or other measures would reduce any such additional amounts (or any similar amount that may thereafter accrue) and would not, in the sole determination of such Finance Party (acting reasonably), result in any unreimbursed cost or expense or be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 (g) If any Finance Party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which indemnification or additional amounts have been paid to it by a Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall promptly remit such refund to such Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnification or additional amounts paid by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01(g) with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Lender or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing authority with respect to such refund net of any Taxes payable by any Administrative Agent or Lender on such interest) provided that the Loan Parties, upon the request of the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agree promptly to return such refund (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) to such party in the event such party is required to repay such refund to the relevant taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything 
 96 

to the contrary in this Section 3.01(g), in no event will a Finance Party be required to pay any amount to a Loan Party pursuant to this Section 3.01(g) the payment of which would place the Finance Party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Finance Party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 3.01(g) shall not be construed to require any Finance Party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Company or any other Person. 
 (h) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms Lender and Finance Party shall, for purposes of this Section 3.01 and the definition of Indemnified Taxes , include any L C Issuer, any Alternative L C Issuer and any Swing Line Lender. 
 Section 3.02. Irish & U.K. Taxes . 
 (a) Each Irish Payment and each UK Payment made by a Loan Party under a Loan Document shall be made by it without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by Law. 
 (b) As soon as it becomes aware that it is or will be required by Law to make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate at which or the basis on which such Tax Deduction is to be made) the relevant Loan Party shall notify the Administrative Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent and the relevant Loan Party upon becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender. 
 (c) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by a Loan Party, the amount of the payment due shall, unless Section 3.02(f) or Section 3.02(g) applies, be increased to an amount so that, after the required Tax Deduction is made, the payee receives an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no Tax Deduction been required. 
 (d) If a Tax Deduction is required by Law to be made by the Administrative Agent or the Security Trustee (other than by reason of the Administrative Agent or the Security Trustee performing its obligations as such under this Agreement through an office located outside the United Kingdom) from any payment to any Finance Party which represents an amount or amounts received from a Loan Party, that Loan Party shall, unless Section 3.02(f) applies, pay directly to that Finance Party an amount which, after making the required Tax Deduction enables the payee of that amount to receive an amount equal to the payment which it would have received if no Tax Deduction had been required.

 (b) Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice described in Section 3.07(a) and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

 Section 3.08. Inability to Determine Rates .

 (c) In furtherance of Section 8.04(a), (i) upon actual receipt and designation of the Cure Amount by a member of the Restricted Group, the Financial Covenant shall be deemed satisfied and complied with as of the end of the relevant fiscal quarter with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply with the Financial Covenant and any Event of Default under the Financial Covenant (and any other Default or resulting Event of Default arising solely as a result thereof) shall be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of the Loan Documents, and (ii) upon delivery to the Administrative Agent prior to the Cure Expiration Date of a notice from such Borrower stating its good faith intention to exercise its right set forth in this Section 8.04, neither the Administrative Agent on or after the last day of the applicable quarter nor any Lender may exercise any rights or remedies under Section 8.02 (or under any other Loan Document) on the basis of any actual or purported Event of Default under the Financial Covenant (and any other Default or resulting Event of Default as a result thereof) until and unless the Cure Expiration Date has occurred without the Cure Amount having been received and designated.

Upon request, and the surrender by the assigning Lender of its Note, the applicable Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender provided that, except as otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.07(c) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.07(e). 
 (d) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption, each Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption delivered to it, and each notice of cancellation of any Loans delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 10.07(k) or Section 10.07(l) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of the Loans, L C Obligations (specifying the Unreimbursed Amounts and the Drawn Amounts thereof), L C Borrowings, Alternative L C Borrowings and the amounts due under Section 2.03, owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the Register ). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers and the Finance Parties shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, and any Finance Party, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. This Section 10.07(d) and Section 2.11 shall be construed so that all Loans are at all times maintained in registered form within the meaning of Section 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and any related United States Department of the Treasury Regulations (or any other relevant or successor provisions of the Code or of such United States Department of the Treasury Regulations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender is an Affiliated Lender nor shall the Administrative Agent be obligated to monitor the aggregate amount of Term Loans held by Affiliated Lenders. 
 (e) Subject to Section 10.07(f), any Lender, without consent of, or notice to, the Company or the Administrative Agent, may at any time sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, any Borrower or any Borrower s Affiliate or its Subsidiaries, a Disqualified Institution or a Defaulting Lender) (each, a Participant in all or a portion of such Lender s rights and or obligations under this Agreement 
 144 

(including all or a portion of its Commitment and or the Loans (including such Lender s participations in L C Obligations and or Swing Line Loans) owing to it) provided that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (i) through (x) of the first proviso to Section 10.01 that requires the affirmative vote of such Lender. Subject to Section 10.07(f), the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 3.09 to the same extent as if it were a Lender (subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the limitations and requirements of those Sections (including Section 3.01(d)) applying to each Participant as if it were a Lender, and it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(d) shall be delivered to the Discount Prepayment Participating Lender) and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(c). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09 as though it were a Lender provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. The portion of any Participant Register relating to any Participant requesting payment from the applicable Borrower or seeking to exercise its rights under Section 10.09 shall be available for inspection by the applicable Borrower upon reasonable request to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Department of the Treasury Regulations, or is otherwise required thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register or with respect to the sale of participations to any Person that is a Disqualified Institution. 
 (f) If 
 (i) a Lender assigns or transfers any participation to a Participant or changes its Lending Office and 
 (ii) as a result of circumstances existing at the date of the assignment or transfer or change, a Loan Party would be obliged to make a payment to the Participant or Lender acting through its new Lending Office under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 or 3.09, 
 then the Participant or Lender acting through its new Lending Office shall only be entitled to receive payment under those Sections to the same extent as the Participant or Lender acting through its existing Lending Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred. This Section 10.07(f) shall not apply to (a) an assignment or transfer in the ordinary course of primary syndication of the Loans or (b) in relation to Section 3.02(c) or (d), to a new lender that has included a confirmation of its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with Section 3.03(c)(i) or (ii) and such Loan Party making the payment has not filed a form DTTP2 with HMRC in respect of that new lender within 30 days following the date of the Assignment and Assumption or Increase Confirmation (as applicable). 
 (g) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 
 145 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a Granting Lender may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (an SPC the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) such SPC and the applicable Loan or any applicable part thereof, shall be appropriately reflected in the Participant Register. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (A) an SPC shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.04, 3.05 and 3.09 (subject to the requirements and the limitations of such Sections and it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(d) shall be delivered to the Granting Lender), but neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement except, in the case of Section 3.01, to the extent that the grant to the SPC was made with the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed provided that for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have a reasonable basis for withholding consent if an exercise by an SPC immediately after the grant would result in materially increased indemnification obligation to the Company at such time), (B) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (C) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the Lender hereunder. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender.
