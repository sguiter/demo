 Certain units of the Company s Indian subsidiaries were established as Export-Oriented units or under the Software Technology Parks of India or Special Economic Zone scheme promulgated by the Government of India.

The Company has undertaken to pay custom duties, service taxes, levies, and liquidated damages payable, if any, in respect of imported and indigenous capital goods, stores and spares consumed duty free, in the event that certain terms and conditions are not fulfilled.

 The Company s operations centers in the Philippines are registered as qualified Philippines Economic Zone Authority units, which provides the Company fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and local purchase of services and materials. The Company is required to meet certain requirements to retain the incentives. The Company has complied, and intends to continue compliance, with the requirements to avail itself of the incentives. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 The transfer pricing regulations in the countries where the Company operates require that controlled intercompany transactions be at arm s-length. Accordingly, the Company determines and documents pricing for controlled intercompany transactions based on an economic analysis as prescribed in the respective regulations. The tax authorities have jurisdiction to review the Company s transfer pricing. If the Company s transfer pricing is challenged by the authorities, they could assess additional tax, interest and penalties, thereby impacting the Company s profitability and cash flows. 
 
 The Company is currently involved in transfer pricing and related income tax disputes with Indian tax authorities. The aggregate amount demanded by Indian tax authorities (net of advance payments) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is and , respectively. The Company has made payments and/or provided bank guarantees against these demands in the amounts of and , as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company believes that its positions will more likely than not be sustained upon final examination by the tax authorities, and accordingly has not accrued any liabilities with respect to these matters in its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 India s VAT regime ended in June 2017 and was replaced by the current Goods and Service Tax GST regime. Pursuant to reviewing the Company s annual VAT filings, the Indian tax authorities raised aggregate VAT demands for tax years 2015 and 2017, in the amounts of and , as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has provided bank guarantees against these demands in the amounts of and , as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The GST authorities rejected the Company s refunds claims in the amounts of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company has filed appeals against these matters and believes that it is more likely than not that upon final examination its position will be sustained based on its technical merits. Accordingly, no provision was recognized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Some of the Company s subsidiaries in India have undergone assessments with the statutory authority with respect to defined contribution plan. Except for some components of the assessments for which the Company has recognized a provision in the financial statements, the Company believes that the amount demanded by such authority is not a meaningful indicator of the potential liabilities of the Company, and that these matters are without merit. The Company is defending against the assessment orders and in one case, has instituted an appeal against the order before the relevant tribunal while also making a payment under protest of the amount demanded. As of the reporting date, the Company s management does not believe that the ultimate assessments in any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate its position based on future events and developments on these matters. 
 
 From time to time, the Company, its subsidiaries, and/or their present officers or directors, may be or have been, named as a defendant in litigation matters, including employment-related claims. The plaintiffs in those cases seek damages, including, where applicable, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney s fees. With respect to pending litigation matters as of the reporting date, the Company believes that the damages claimed are without merit, and the Company intends to vigorously

Revenues 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 472.1 million compared to revenues of 411.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 61.1 million, or 14.9 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 1,356.9 million compared to revenues of 1,216.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 140.3 million, or 11.5 . 
 
 We serve cli ents mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, with these two regions generating 82.2 and 12.0 , respectively, of our total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 83.5 and 11.3 , respectively, of our total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these two regions generated 82.6 and 11.8 , respectively, of our total revenues and 84.1 and 10.8 , respectively, of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for 34.2 and 34.6 of our total revenues, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for 33.2 and 34.2 of our total revenues, respectively. Although we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base, we believe that the loss of any of our top ten clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 Our Business 
 
 We provide data analytics and digital operations and solutions to our clients. We market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by key industry verticals and cross-industry domains such as finance and accounting. Our sales and client management teams operate primarily from the United States, Europe and Australia. 
 
 Digital Operations and Solutions: We provide our clients with a range of data and AI-led digital operations and solutions from our Insurance, Healthcare and Emerging Business strategic business units, which are focused on solving complex industry challenges, which include: a) multi-modal data ingestion using AI, and converting unstructured content into curated and usable data, b) real-time and comprehensive data insights including end-to-end data management and building a 360-degree view of our clients customers, c) omni-channel and frictionless customer experience including self-service, conversational AI and smart agent assist, d) intelligent and AI-powered redesign and automation of transaction processing and e) automated quality, compliance and audit. Some of our clients operations that we have transformed using the above solutions include underwriting operations, claims processing, accounts payables processing, utilization management, member and provider contact center services and collections and accounts receivable. We either manage and digitally transform these operations for our clients by deploying our solutions through a software-as-a-service model via our partners cloud network or a client s on-cloud deployment model, to digitally transform their retained operations. For a portion of our digital operations and solutions, we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant business operations, implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client s customers. Each client contract has different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement. We also provide consulting services related to digital operations and solutions that include industry-specific digital transformational services as well as cross-industry finance and accounting services as part of the Emerging Business strategic business unit. 
 
 We provide our services under contracts with our clients, which typically have terms of three or more years, with some being contracts with no end dates. These contracts provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our digital operations and solutions business. However, our clients can typically terminate these contracts with or without cause and with short notice periods. We have a long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of entering into definitive agreements with new clients. Similarly, new license sales and implementation projects for our technology service platforms and other software-based services have a long selling cycle, however ongoing annual maintenance and support contracts for existing arrangements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base. 
 
 We charge for our services using various pricing models like time-and-material pricing, full-time-equivalent pricing, transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing, subscription-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. Outcome-

Table of Contents 

 based pricing arrangements are examples of non-linear pricing models where clients link revenues from platforms and solutions and the services we provide to usage or savings rather than the efforts deployed to provide these services. We continue to observe a shift in the industry pricing models toward transaction-based pricing, outcome-based pricing and other alternative pricing models. We believe this trend will continue and we use such alternative pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a full-time-equivalent pricing model to a transaction-based or other alternative pricing model. These alternative pricing models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve our gross margins. 
 
 We have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi-vendor relationships with regard to their digital operations and solutions needs to seek more favorable contract terms and diversification of the risk of concentration on a few vendors. We believe that the trend toward multi-vendor relationships will continue. A multi-vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor, which can result in significantly reduced gross margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor. To the extent our large clients expand their use of multi-vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors, our gross margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationships with such clients to meet competition. 
 
 Analytics: Our analytics services aim to drive better business outcomes for our clients by unlocking deep insights from data and creating data and AI-led solutions across all parts of our clients business. We provide care optimization and reimbursement optimization services for our clients through our healthcare analytics solutions and services. We also offer integrated solutions to help our clients in cost containment by leveraging technology platforms, customizable and configurable analytics and expertise in healthcare reimbursements to help clients enhance their claim payment accuracy. Our Analytics teams deliver predictive and prescriptive analytics in the areas of customer acquisition and life cycle management, risk underwriting and pricing, operational effectiveness, credit and operational risk monitoring and governance, regulatory reporting and data management. We enhance, modernize and enrich structured and unstructured data and use a spectrum of advanced analytical tools and techniques, including our in-house and third-party AI, generative AI, and ML capabilities and proprietary solutions to create insights, improve decision making for our clients and address a range of complex industry-wide priorities. We actively cross-sell and, where appropriate, integrate our analytics services with other digital operations and solutions as part of a comprehensive offering for our clients. Our project-based analytics services are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles. In addition, our project-based analytics services are documented in contracts with terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed. These contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period. The short-term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from providing analytics services. 
 
 We anticipate that revenues from our analytics services will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base, both organically and through acquisitions. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, issued a Pillar II model for implementing a 15 global minimum tax effective January 1, 2024. The application of the rules relating to Pillar II continue to evolve, and there are countries that are still in the process of issuing attendant rules and regulations, including available transitional safe harbor rules. The two countries where we operate but do not meet the available safe harbor rules are the Republic of Ireland and the Philippines. The Pillar II impacts for the Republic of Ireland and the Philippines are not significant and have been properly reflected in our financial statements. We will continue to monitor Pillar II developments and assess any future impacts. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates referred in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 Other income, net increased by 3.5 million, from 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to higher yield on our investments of 0.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and recognition of contingent consideration liability of 2.5 million related to our December 2021 acquisition of Clairvoyant AI, Inc.

 Income Tax Expense. The effective tax rate decreased from 24.4 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.6 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded income tax expense of 15.5 million and 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of higher profit during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Income. Net income increased from 43.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 53.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of 9.2 million and higher other income, net of 3.5 million, partially offset by higher interest expense of 2.1 million, higher income tax expense of 1.3 million and lower foreign exchange gain, net of 0.1 million.

 Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 88.6 million, or 11.7 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The increase in cost of revenues in Healthcare of 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of 4.4 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation and higher technology costs of 0.6 million on account of increased subscription to cloud-based software licenses and use of the hybrid working model, partially offset by lower other operating costs of 0.3 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of 1.2 million. Gross margin in Healthcare decreased by 30 bps during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, partially offset by higher revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The increase in cost of revenues in Analytics of 27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of 23.5 million on account of higher headcount, restructuring costs and wage inflation, including incremental cost related to our August 2024 acquisition of ITI Data, and higher technology costs of 6.5 million on account of increased subscription to cloud-based software licenses and use of the hybrid working model, partially offset by lower other operating costs of 1.0 million and foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of 1.4 million.

 The increase in SG A expenses of 43.0 million was primarily due to higher employee-related costs of 26.4 million on account of higher headcount and wage inflation, including incremental cost related to our August 2024 acquisition of ITI Data, higher investments in digital and generative AI capabilities of 10.9 million, higher sales and marketing spend of 1.2 million, restructuring costs, litigation settlement costs and associated legal fees of 3.1 million and higher other operating costs of 2.3 million. This was partially offset by foreign exchange gain, net of hedging of 0.9 million, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 The increase in depreciation expense of 2.7 million was primarily due to investments in digital capabilities, computers and networking equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in intangibles amortization expense of 1.9 million was primarily due to end of useful lives for certain intangible assets, partially offset by amortization of intangibles associated with our acquisition of ITI Data in August 2024, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income from Operations. Income from operations increased by 7.9 million, or 4.3 , from 184.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 192.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher SG A expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Gain, net. Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily attributable to the movement of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the U.K. pound sterling and the South African rand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 82.38 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 83.44 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Interest expense. Interest expense increased from 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 14.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher average borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Other income, net increased by 5.2 million, from 6.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to higher yield on our investments of 1.5 million, lower other expenses of 0.6 million, a decrease of 0.6 million in contingent consideration liability related to our June 2022 acquisition of Inbound Media Group, LLC as a result of fair value adjustment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and recognition of contingent consideration liability of 2.5 million related to our December 2021 acquisition of Clairvoyant during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. The effective tax rate increased from 20.8 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded income tax expense of 43.1 million and 37.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was primarily as a result of higher profit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and lower excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Income. Net income increased from 144.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 147.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in income from operations of 7.9 million and higher other income, net of 5.2 million, partially offset by higher income tax expense of 5.3 million, higher interest expense of 4.1 million, loss from equity-method investment of 0.3 million and lower foreign exchange gain, net of 0.1 million.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Nine months ended September 30, Dollar Change Percentage Change 2024 2023 (dollars in millions) Opening cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 145.4 125.6 19.8 15.7 Net cash provided by operating activities 163.2 132.2 31.0 23.5 Net cash (used for)/provided by investing activities (94.5) 11.4 (105.9) (926.0) Net cash used for financing activities (52.2) (141.0) 88.8 (63.0) Effect of exchange rate changes 1.4 (0.3) 1.7 (561.8) Closing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 163.3 127.9 35.4 27.6 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 325.8 million and 274.2 million, respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which 288.5 million and 256.5 million, respectively, is located in foreign jurisdictions that upon distribution may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We periodically evaluate opportunities to distribute cash among our group entities to fund our operations, expand our business and make strategic acquisitions in the United States and other geographies, and as and when we decide to distribute, we may have to accrue in the year of distribution any additional taxes required in accordance with local tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, one of our subsidiaries in India repatriated 18.3 million (net of 1.0 million withholding taxes) to the United States. 
 
 Operating Activities: Cash provided by operating activities were 163.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 132.2 million during nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting higher cash earnings and lower working capital needs. The major drivers contributing to the increase of 31.0 million year-over-year included the following: 
 
 Increase in cash earnings including adjustments for non-cash and other items contributed higher cash flow of 4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These adjustments include fair value mark-to-market of investments, unrealized foreign currency exchange (gain)/loss, net, stock-based compensation expense, fair value changes in contingent consideration, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and intangibles acquired in business combination, among others. 
 
 Changes in accounts receivable, including advance billings, contributed higher cash flow of 15.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Collections in accounts receivable, including advance billings, was driven by revenue growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our days sales outstanding remained flat at 64 days as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Payment of contingent consideration related to our December 2021 acquisition of Clairvoyant contributed to a higher cash payout of 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Changes in other assets, accounts payables including other liabilities contributed to a higher cash flow of 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities: Cash used for investing activities were 94.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by investing activities of 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 105.9 million was primarily due to net purchase of investments of 33.4 million and net cash used for business acquisition of 24.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net redemption of investments 52.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by lower cash paid for purchase of long-lived assets, including investments in infrastructure, technology assets, digital capabilities of 4.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Financing Activities: Cash used for financing activities were 52.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 141.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 88.8 million was primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and new term loan facility of 145.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net repayment of our borrowings of 40.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was partially offset by higher purchases of treasury stock of 95.3 million under our share repurchase programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business by making investments, primarily related to building new digital capabilities, including generative AI and purchase telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations. 
 
 We incurred 36.2 million of capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of between 48.0 million to 52.0 million in fiscal 2024, primarily to meet our growth requirements, including additions to our facilities as well as investments in technology applications, product development, digital technology, advanced automation, robotics and infrastructure. 
 
 In connection with any tax assessment orders that have been issued, or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries, we may be required to deposit additional amounts with the relevant authorities with respect to such assessment orders. See Note 25 - Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements for further details. 
 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, our investments in strategic initiatives, applications or technologies, operation centers and acquisition of complementary businesses, continued stock repurchases under our board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing. We anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance most of our above-mentioned requirements, although if we have significant growth through acquisitions or significant stock repurchases, including any shares purchased under an accelerated stock repurchase program, we may need to obtain additional financing. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. These obligations include borrowings, including interest obligations, purchase commitments, operating and finance lease commitments, employee benefit payments under gratuity plans, payments for contingent consideration and uncertain tax positions. See Note 16 - Fair Value Measurements - Fair Value of Contingent Consideration, Note 18 - Borrowings, Note 21 - Leases and Note 25 - Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements under Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements for further information on material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit to third parties primarily for facility leases. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit of 0.7 million and 0.5 million, respectively, that were not recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. These are unlikely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. We had no other off-balance sheet arrangements or obligations.
