Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Throughout this section, references to "Roadzen," we, us, and our refer to Roadzen Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as the context so requires. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, and continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our strategy, expansion plans, future operations, future operating results, planned capital raises and balance sheet restructuring, estimated revenues (including from new contracts and joint ventures), losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as all other statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in Risk Factors, Critical Accounting Estimates, Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Liquidity and Capital Resources in our other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. We urge you to consider these factors, risks and uncertainties carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report are made only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: 
 our ability to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability; 

our ability to raise sufficient capital to support our operations and growth; 

the fact that we may be unable to accurately predict our future capital needs, and we may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all; 

substantial regulation and the potential for unfavorable changes to, or our failure to comply with, these regulations, which could substantially harm our business and operating results; 

our management team s limited experience managing a public company; 

the risk that our significant increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; and 

the other factors set forth in Risk Factors, Critical Accounting Estimates, Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Quarterly Report and our other SEC filings.

 par value ("Ordinary Shares") as follows: (i) each outstanding share of common stock of Roadzen (DE) including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of each outstanding share of Roadzen (DE) s convertible preferred stock, was cancelled and converted into Ordinary Shares, (ii) each restricted stock unit of Roadzen (DE) Roadzen (DE) RSU was assumed and converted into the right to receive restricted stock units of the Parent Company (each, a RDZN RSU and were assumed as Substitute Awards under the Roadzen Inc. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan, (iii) each equity security of Roadzen (DE) other than Roadzen (DE) common stock and Roadzen (DE) RSUs (each, a Roadzen (DE) Additional Security was assumed and converted into the right to receive equity interests that may vest, settle, convert or be exercised into Ordinary Shares, (iv) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing was cancelled, retired and ceased to exist, and (v) each ordinary share of Vahanna (each, a Vahanna Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and not redeemed in connection with the Redemption (as defined below) remained outstanding and is now Ordinary Share. Further, in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination (the Closing ), Vahanna changed its name to Roadzen Inc. . Beginning on September 21, 2023, the Company s Ordinary Shares and warrants trade on the Nasdaq Global Market and Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol RDZN and RDZNW respectively. The Company determined that Roadzen (DE) was the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification 805. The determination was primarily based on the following facts: - Roadzen (DE) stockholders having a controlling voting interest in the Company; - Roadzen (DE) existing management team serving as the initial management team of the Company and holding a majority of the initial board of directors of the Company; - Roadzen (DE) management continuing to hold executive management roles for the post-combination company and being responsible for the day-to-day operations; and - Roadzen (DE) operations comprising the ongoing operations of the Company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Roadzen (DE) issuing stock for the net assets of Vahanna, accompanied by a recapitalization. The primary assets acquired from Vahanna related to cash amounts and a forward purchase agreement ("FPA") that was assumed at fair value upon closing of the Business Combination. No goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded as a result of the Business Combination. While Vahanna was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, because Roadzen (DE) was deemed the accounting acquirer, the historical financial statements of Roadzen (DE) became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the

from Cost of Services to Sales Marketing in the six month ended September 30, 2024 and in the six month ended September 30, 2023. This reclassification impacts the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, where these expenses are now reported under Sales Marketing instead of Cost of Services. This reclassification does not affect the Company's net income or loss, nor does it alter the figures presented in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, or Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders' Deficit. The change ensures that the financial statements provide a clearer and more accurate view of the Company's cost structure.

. Inspection income: The Company enters into contracts with insurance companies to inspect vehicles for accident claims made by their policyholders. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to inspect and assist in assessing claims for and on behalf of the customers, i.e. the insurance companies. The Company engages with multiple vendors to provide these services in different geographies. The Company is the primary obligor in the transaction and has latitude in establishing prices, and selecting and contracting with suppliers, and is accordingly considered as principal for the purpose of recognizing revenue. Revenue from inspection and risk assessment is recorded when the inspections are conducted. Administration fee from insurance support and service plan administration: The Company enters into contracts with insurance companies to provide insurance support services which includes premium collection, policy administration, claims handling and processing, customer service, updating customer files, etc., to provide better customer experience for the policyholders/subscribers. Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied through effort expended to research, investigate, evaluate, document and process claims, and control of these services are transferred to customers/insurance companies. The Company s obligation to manage and process the claims under insurance support services can range from one to . The Company receives administration fees from its customers at inception of the contract prior to completion of transferring the services to the customer. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to provide the above services as a stand ready obligation. The obligation to provide insurance services lies with the insurer and the Company has no interest other than receiving the commission/management fee retained. The Company provides the above services on behalf of the insurance companies and is accordingly considered as an agent for the purpose of recognizing revenue. The Company enters into contracts with Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") primarily to administer the service plans/extended warranty schemes launched by OEMs. The Company s performance obligation under these contracts is to administer these programs. The Company acts on behalf of the OEMs and is accordingly considered as an agent for the purpose of recognizing revenue, as the primary obligation to fulfill the service/extended warranty schemes belongs to the OEMs. The administration fees received from the provision of service plan administration is recorded ratably over the tenure of contract which usually ranges from one to . f) Contract assets and liabilities 

 A contract asset (unbilled revenue) is the right to receive consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract liabilities consist of amounts paid by the Company s customers for which the associated performance obligations have not been satisfied and revenue has not been recognized based on the Company s revenue recognition criteria described above. Contract liabilities are classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur within one year of the balance sheet date and as long-term when the revenue recognition associated with the related customer payments and invoicing is expected to occur in more than one year from the balance sheet date.

Leasehold improvements related to office facilities are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. The Company reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its property and equipment on an ongoing basis. Management is required to use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to the Company s business model, changes in the Company s business strategy, or changes in the planned use of property and equipment could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company s current estimates. In cases where the Company determines that the estimated useful life of property and equipment should be shortened or extended, the Company would apply the new estimated useful life prospectively. The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not

 c) in advances were extended to Peoplebay Consultancy Services Private Limited, FA Events Media Private Limited, and FA Premium Insurance Private Limited. However, due to a loss of control over these entities during the previous year, the Company is doubtful on the recovery of these advances and has consequently created a provision. 

 ii) Other receivables includes a provision of created against amount to be received from a subscriber on account of issuance of preferred stock of Roadzen (DE) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 which was converted to ordinary shares upon business combination. iii) Forward purchase agreement On August 25 2023, Vahanna entered into an agreement with (i) Meteora Capital Partners, LP MCP ), (ii) Meteora Select Trading Opportunities Master, LP MSTO ), and (iii) Meteora Strategic Capital, LLC MSC and, collectively with MCP and MSTO, Seller (the Forward Purchase Agreement" or "FPA for OTC Equity Prepaid Forward Transactions. Vahanna is referred to as the Counterparty prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, while the Parent Company is referred to as the Counterparty after the consummation of the Business Combination. The Forward Purchase Agreement represents the recognition of the cash payments to the Seller of million (including prepayment of million and the reimbursable transaction cost of million) and the Forward Purchase agreement with regard to shares (recycled shares) and shares (FPA subscription shares).The fair value of the Forward Purchase agreement is comprised of the Prepayment Amount (as defined in the FPA, million) and is reduced by the economics of the downside provided to the Sellers million) and the estimated consideration payment at the Cash Settlement Payment Date million). During the six months ended September 30, 2024, an additional million was received from the Seller, bringing the total cash receipts to million. The Forward Purchase Agreement asset was adjusted as a result, and will continue to be re-measured at fair value in future periods. The Forward purchase agreement are treated as a Financial Instrument and revalued at each reporting date with the corresponding earnings (loss) reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a change in fair value of the Forward Purchase Agreement.

Overview 
 
 Roadzen is a leading Insurtech company on a mission to transform global auto insurance powered by advanced artificial intelligence ("AI"). At the heart of our mission is our commitment to create transparency, efficiency, and a seamless experience for the millions of end customers who use our products through our insurer, OEM, and fleet (such as trucking, delivery, and commercial fleets) partners. We seek to accomplish this by combining computer vision, telematics and AI with continually updated data sources to provide a more efficient, effective and informed way of building auto insurance products, assessing damages, processing claims and improving driver safety. Insurers and other partners of Roadzen across the world use Roadzen s technology to launch new auto insurance products, manage risk better and resolve claims faster. These products are built with dynamic underwriting capabilities, Application Programming Interface, or API-led distribution and real-time claims processing. 
 
 Roadzen has built a pioneering technology platform that uses telematics, computer vision and data science to spearhead innovation across the insurance value chain, namely underwriting, distribution, claims and road safety. We call it the Roadzen Insurance as a Service IaaS platform. Our business generates commission-based revenue as an insurance broker focused on embedded and B2B2C (Business-to-Business-to-Customer) insurance distribution, and fee-based revenue as a provider of innovative cloud, mobile, AI-based telematics applications for the auto insurance economy. 
 
 Roadzen has four major clients types: 
 Insurance including insurance companies, reinsurers, agents, brokers; 
 Automotive including carmakers, dealerships, online-to-offline car sales platforms; 
 Fleets including small and medium fleets, taxi fleets, ridesharing platforms, commercial and corporate fleets; and 
 Other distribution channels such as financial services companies providing auto loans and telematics companies. 
 
 Our operations are global, and our partners consists of market-leading insurance companies, fleets, automotive original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and carmakers, including AXA, SCOR, Arch, Soci t G n rale Jaguar Land Rover, Audi, Mercedes, Volvo and several others. In June of 2023, we made two acquisitions as part of our market entry strategy into the important U.S. and U.K. markets. Our subsidiary in the U.K., Global Insurance Management Ltd. ("GIM"), is a leading specialist Managing General Agent ("MGA") providing auto insurance, extended warranties, and claims management to insurers, car dealers, car companies, and fleets. GIM delivers services globally, leveraging its MGA licenses in the U.K. market and using third-party licenses elsewhere. GIM provides brokerage services to insurance companies, where it acts as a delegated authority of the insurance company to sell the insurer s policies using its brokerage platform, as well as to adjudicate and pay claims. GIM collects a commission and an administrative fee as a percentage of the Gross Written Premium ("GWP") from each policy sold from the insurer/re-insurer during this process. GIM s specialty insurance contracts typically have an average term of five years. GIM is headquartered in Coventry, England. Roadzen's subsidiary in the U.S., National Automobile Club ("NAC"), is a licensed auto club in California and a provider of claims management and 24/7 commercial roadside assistance ("RSA") in the U.S. NAC focuses on the commercial automotive industry and its network comprises over 75,000 professional service providers, offering tow, transport, and first notice of loss FNOL services. NAC s customers include government fleets, enterprises, commercial fleets, car companies and insurers across the U.S. NAC is headquartered in Burlingame, California. 
 Our mission is to build the leading company at the intersection of artificial intelligence ("AI"), insurance and mobility. To further our mission, we have built a pioneering lab focused on fundamental and applied AI research. We work on core research areas in computer vision, generative AI, and traditional machine learning to develop product experiences that improve the safety, convenience, and protection of millions of drivers across the world. Roadzen is a founding member of the AI Alliance fostering safe, responsible, and open source development alongside industry leaders such as Meta, IBM, Hugging Face, Stability AI, AMD, Service Now, and others. Our approach to build precision AI models in insurance and mobility has won several industry accolades. In October 2021 Forbes Magazine ranked Roadzen 
 36 

among the Top 10 AI companies. In 2022, Financial Express named Roadzen AI Startup of the Year. Additionally, the Company won two awards at the prestigious Global Artificial Intelligence Summit Awards: "Best Use of AI in Mobility" and "Best Use of AI in Insurance," both presented by the All India Council for Robotics Automation (AICRA). 
 
 On September 20, 2023, Roadzen Inc., a British Virgin Islands business company (the Parent Company , formerly known as Vahanna Tech Edge Acquisition I Corp; and sometimes referred to in this filing as "Vahanna") completed the Business Combination in which it acquired Roadzen (DE). Roadzen (DE) was determined to be the accounting acquiror in the Business Combination. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Roadzen (DE) became the historical financial statements of the combined company upon the consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Roadzen (DE) prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of the Parent Company and Roadzen (DE) following the Closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Roadzen (DE) at their historical cost; and (iv) the Company s equity structure for all periods presented. 
 
 Our Business Model 
 
 Roadzen has two principal models for generating revenue: 1) platform sales of our IaaS platform, and 2) brokerage commission and fees. We follow a capital-light business model, meaning that we do not underwrite any risk ourselves or carry it on our balance sheet for either source of revenue. 
 
 1. Platform Sales : 
 
 Roadzen provides an IaaS platform addressed towards insurance for mobility. The IaaS platform has a suite of products that work cohesively to address the auto insurance value chain. Roadzen sells its IaaS platform to insurers, car manufacturers, and fleet companies to deliver services for their respective insured customers. Our deep understanding of the insurance industry has enabled us to develop a unified suite of modules and products that is tailored to address the key challenges faced in auto insurance. Our solution suite includes several products that support the insurance lifecycle, such as: 
 Via : enables fleets, carmakers and insurers to inspect a vehicle using computer vision; 

Global Distribution Network (GDN) : enables the configuration, customer quote, payment (in any currency), and administration of any insurance policy with any insurance carrier as the underwriter; 

xClaim : enables digital, touchless and real-time resolution of claims from FNOL through payment, using telematics and computer vision; 

StrandD : enables digital, real-time dispatch and tracking for roadside assistance ("RSA") and FNOL during accident claims; 

DrivebuddyAI : enables any vehicle to get advanced driver-assistance capabilities utilizing cameras and neural networks to deliver better safety on the road; and 

Good Driving : enables insurers and fleets to recognize their best drivers, train poor drivers and build usage based insurance ("UBI") programs. 

Our technology revolutionizes the customer experience by helping customers obtain a policy within seconds and process a claim estimate within minutes in comparison with existing processes that can take weeks. Roadzen s revenue derived from platform sales is usage-based, meaning we get paid on a per-vehicle or per-use basis. 
 
 Sales of Roadzen s IaaS platform represented approximately 50 and 56 of revenues for the for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 2. Brokerage Commission and Fees : 
 
 Roadzen acts as an insurance broker utilizing its technology to sell insurance through our embedded and Business to Business to Consumer ("B2B2C") distribution model. The policies are sold by insurance intermediaries such as agents and through captive distributors such as dealerships, fleets and used car platforms. Our B2B2C channel partners choose us for a variety of reasons for the ease of integrating our technology through APIs into their ecosystem, for a seamless, fully digital customer experience from obtaining a policy to submitting a claim, and for integrations with a large number of insurance companies who sell their policies through our platform to give users a handful of policy options. Lastly, we can provide a superior customer experience by bundling telematics for road safety, RSA and claims management to the customer a customer experience that we believe is unrivaled by other traditional brokers. Roadzen s revenues from brokerage services are based on commissions and other fees that are paid by our insurance carrier partners as a percentage of the Gross Written Premium ("GWP") underwritten for each policy. 
 
 37 

Roadzen s brokerage solutions accounted for 50 and 44 of revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024. 

Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: 
 
 Investment in Core Technology and AI 
 
 We continue to develop and invest in our technology platform to drive scalability and build innovative products. We believe our significant proprietary investments into our data pipelines, training, model development and our core technology platform are key advantages that allow us to stay ahead of the competition, support our growth into global markets and improve operating margins. 
 
 Investment in Sales and Marketing 
 
 Our sales and marketing efforts are a key component of our growth strategy. Our investments in this area have enabled us to build and sustain our customer base while creating long-term customer relationships. Our sales efforts are materially dependent on our three different channels: (1) strategic sales to insurers and car companies; (2) sales to small-and-medium fleet owners; and (3) brokerage sales driven by agents, captive distribution channels and reinsurance partnerships. We plan to continue investing in each of these channels of growth including hiring sales personnel, event marketing and global travel. 
 
 Investments in Innovation for Future Growth 
 
 The world of mobility is changing rapidly due to advances in connected, electric, and autonomous vehicles. We believe this presents an exciting and large opportunity to build insurance for this evolving environment. For this reason, our performance will be impacted by our ability to continuously innovate our underwriting algorithms, internalize new data sources and technologies such as Advanced Driving Assistance Systems ("ADAS") and video telematics for accident prevention, and invest in partnerships with carmakers for their insurance offerings and for selling insurance into fleets. 
 
 Acquiring New Customers 
 
 Our long-term growth will depend on our continued ability to attract new customers to our platform. We intend to continue to drive customers to our platform by expanding our B2B2C model through different avenues. 
 In addition to our existing geographic and product footprint, we aim to grow by expanding into new markets across our target geographies, leveraging our technology platform to increase our speed to market. 

We intend to consistently offer cutting edge technology at the intersection of mobility and insurance - a capability that traditional insurance carriers and other insurance intermediaries have struggled to provide. As our clients look to digitize and capture a greater part of the insurance value chain, our technology is the differentiator for them to choose Roadzen as a partner. 

Expanding Sales Within Our Existing Customer Base 
 
 A central part of our strategy is expanding solutions adoption across our existing customer base. We have developed long-term relationships with our customers and have a proven track record of successfully cross-selling product offerings. We have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling additional functionality to customers that do not currently utilize our full solution portfolio from our platform. As we innovate and bring new technology and solutions to market, we also have the opportunity to realize incremental growth by selling new products to our existing customer base. 

Our ability to expand sales within our customer base will depend on a number of factors, including our customers satisfaction, pricing, competition, and changes in our customers spending levels. Roadzen s customers include leading insurers and car companies that have a global presence and are spending millions of dollars on digitizing their insurance offerings. We believe that successful integration in one geography may open up opportunities within other geographies. Roadzen has shown the ability to expand contracts from low ticket size in India to higher ticket size in global markets. We have a significant focus on maximizing the lifetime value of our customer relationships, and we continue to make significant investments in order to grow our customer base. 
 
 Since January 1, 2023 we began tracking customer segmentation for Roadzen, described as such: enterprise clients that include insurers, automakers and large fleets (above 100 vehicles), and SMB clients, which include agents, brokers, small dealerships, and small fleets (under 100 vehicles). As of September 30, 2024, we had 34 insurance customer agreements (including carriers, self-insureds and other entities processing insurance claims), 74 automotive customer agreements, and approximately 3,550 agents and fleet customers agreements. 
 38 

Strength of the Auto Insurance Market 
 We generate a majority of our revenues through commissions and fees which are a reflection of the total insurance policy premium. Roadzen derived 50 of revenue from its brokerage solutions and 50 from its platform sales of its IaaS platform for the three months ended September 30, 2024. A softening of the insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates due to competition or regulation could negatively impact our financial results. 
 
 Our Regulatory Environment 
 
 Our insurance brokerage business is subject to various laws and regulations and our inability to comply with them may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and reputation. 
 
 Our subsidiary in India is licensed to act as a direct insurance broker (life and general) under the Insurance Brokers Regulations of India. Accordingly, we are subject to certain laws, regulations and licensing requirements. Insurance brokers operating in India are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, including stipulations that: (i) the principal officer and broker qualified persons of an insurance broker must undergo training and pass the relevant examinations specified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (the IRDAI (ii) the principal officer, directors, shareholders and key management personnel must fulfill the fit and proper criteria specified under the Insurance Brokers Regulations; (iii) insurance brokers may not undertake multi-level marketing for solicitation and procuring of insurance products; (iv) insurance brokers may not offer any rebate or any other inducement to a client; (v) insurance brokers must conduct their business in compliance with the code of conduct specified under the Insurance Brokers Regulations; and (vi) insurance brokers must ensure that not more than 50 of their remuneration emanates from one client in a financial year. The IRDAI may undertake inspection of the premises of an insurance broker to ascertain how activities are carried on, and inspect their books of accounts, records and documents. The Insurance Brokers Regulations specify certain approval and reporting requirements to be adhered to by the insurance brokers from time to time, as applicable. We would be subject to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with the Insurance Brokers Regulations. We derive revenues primarily from commissions and other fees paid by insurance carriers for insurance products purchased by our customers. 
 
 The commissions that we can charge to our insurer partners are based on charges set forth under the IRDAI (Payment of Commission or Remuneration or Reward to Insurance Agents and Insurance Intermediaries) Regulations, 2016 IRDAI Commissions Regulations ). The IRDAI (Minimum Information Required for Investigation and Inspection) Regulations, 2020 Minimum Information Regulations ), effective from May 23, 2021, are applicable to all insurers and insurance intermediaries in relation to purposes of investigation and inspection by the IRDAI. 
 
 Inter-related companies within the group are subject to a stringent regulatory framework that affects the flexibility of our operations and increases compliance costs, and any regulatory action against us and our employees may result in penalties and/or sanctions that could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and is subject to change. The government of India GoI may implement new laws or other regulations and policies that could affect the fintech industry, which could lead to new compliance requirements, including requiring us to obtain approvals and licenses from the GoI and other regulatory bodies, or impose onerous requirements. New compliance requirements could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our subsidiary in the U.K. is licensed as a MGA, under which we are subject to stringent oversight by the FCA. Our operations must align with FCA regulations that are specifically tailored to govern the conduct and obligations of MGAs, which act as an intermediary between insurers and clients, with delegated authority to underwrite and process claims on behalf of insurers. Our adherence to these regulations encompasses a variety of compliance obligations, including but not limited to, ensuring that underwriting decisions are made with the requisite skill and care, maintaining accurate and secure records of insurance contracts, managing potential conflicts of interest, and safeguarding client funds. The FCA also imposes comprehensive conduct rules and solvency requirements that require us to act with due care in the interests of policyholders. 
 
 The FCA s regime for MGAs mandates a high level of financial prudence and transparency, necessitating robust internal controls and reporting systems. Failure to meet these stringent regulatory requirements could result in significant sanctions, including financial penalties, suspension of authorization, or other disciplinary actions. Given the evolving nature of the regulatory environment, changes in the FCA s rules or the introduction of new legislation could necessitate adjustments to our operational and compliance processes. These changes could carry implications for our business model and may incur additional compliance costs, ultimately impacting our financial results and operational flexibility. 
 
 39 

Roadzen is committed to maintaining a rigorous compliance posture to meet the FCA s expectations for MGAs. Any lapse in our compliance framework could lead to regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, and negatively affect our business operations and financial position. It is imperative for us to continuously monitor regulatory developments and adapt our compliance measures accordingly to mitigate the risk of enforcement actions and to uphold the trust of our clients and partners. 
 
 The FCA has recently conducted a comprehensive review of the Guaranteed Asset Protection ("GAP") product, a key contributor to our operations in the U.K., resulting in a directive for all insurers, including our insurance partner, to temporarily cease selling the GAP product in February 2024. The regulator has mandated that insurers make a resubmission, or new GAP proposal, outlining the product features, coverages and pricing for approval by the FCA before sales of the GAP product can be resumed. 
 
 As our insurance partner is obligated to adhere to FCA guidelines, any delay or challenges in their obtaining FCA approval of their resubmission may have a negative impact on our business. The resubmission process introduces uncertainty, as there is no guarantee of swift regulatory approval. The temporary suspension of GAP sales may have a significant impact on our revenue, financial performance, and overall profitability. We are actively working with our insurance partner to address the concerns raised by the regulator, expedite the resubmission process, and seek timely FCA approval to resume GAP sales, however, there can be no assurance that the resubmission will receive prompt regulatory approval. Delays in obtaining approval may result in prolonged disruption to our business operations, potential reputational damage, and potential loss of clients and customer confidence. Additionally, the resubmission process may require adjustments to the GAP product, potentially increasing our costs and decreasing our profit margin and any delays or unfavorable outcomes may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Our subsidiary in the U.S. is licensed as an auto club in California, which exposes Roadzen to a distinct set of risks due to the stringent regulatory landscape enforced by the California Department of Insurance CDI ). Compliance with these regulations is paramount, as they govern a wide spectrum of our activities, including membership services, claims management, and financial integrity. 
 
 Our Ability to Manage Risk with Data and Technology 
 
 Our operations are highly dependent on the reliability, availability, and security of our technology platform and data. Our operations rely on the secure processing and storage of confidential information, including our information systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers. Disruptions in the technology platform, systems and control failures, security breaches, or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in legal exposure, harm our reputation and brand, and ultimately affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and have taken protective actions to reduce risk, such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized and malicious attacks. As our technology-enabled platform is reliant on data from external parties, such attacks or disruption in our data sources can impact our ability to operate effectively and result in damage to our reputation and results. 
 
 Lock-up Agreements 
 
 In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, certain holders of equity in Vahanna and Roadzen (DE) entered into lock-up agreements (the Lock-up Agreements with the Parent Company and Roadzen (DE). Pursuant to the Lock-up Agreements, certain holders of our ordinary shares agreed, subject to certain customary exceptions, to be subject to a lock-up period lasting until the earlier of (x) the one year anniversary of consummation of the Business Combination, (y) the date that the closing price of Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share recapitalizations, subdivisions, reorganizations and the like), for 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period at least 150 days following the Closing of the Business Combination, and (z) the consummation of a liquidation, merger, capital share exchange, reorganization, tender or exchange offer as the first step of a two-step transaction or other similar transaction that results in all of the Parent Company's shareholders having the right to exchange their equity holdings in the Parent Company for cash, securities or other property; provided that equityholders of Roadzen (DE) that held less than 5 of the equity securities of Roadzen (DE) (on a fully diluted basis) immediately prior to the Closing were permitted to transfer and/or sell up to 25 of their shares following the six month anniversary of the date of the Closing of the Business Combination. On April 1, 2024, 3,502,949 Ordinary Shares were released from the Lock-up Agreements pursuant to such provisions. In September 2024, holders of approximately 56 million ordinary shares subject to the Lock-up Agreements agreed to extend the lock-up period for an additional twelve months, to September 20, 2025 (subject to earlier termination as described above). 

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 We provide access to our IaaS solutions through contractual agreements with our customers, whereby the customer receives one or a bundle of our solutions, which can include inspection, claims management, RSA, and/or telematics offerings. The average contract length for our IaaS customers is approximately three years. Our clients pay us on a fixed fee per-incident or per-vehicle. Our brokerage revenues 
 40 

are based on commissions and fees that we receive from our insurance partners for selling their policies to customers as well as providing other client services such as claims management. Our commissions and fees are calculated as a percentage of the GWP underwritten for each policy. 
 
 Cost of Services 
 The cost of services for distribution business includes commissions paid to the point-of-sale person, cost of employees and other direct expenses related to facilities. 
 For our IaaS platform, cost of services primarily consists of direct costs involved in delivering the services to the customers, including external provider cost for inspections and RSA, as well as additional costs such as employee benefit expenses. Costs forming part of cost of revenue are recognized as incurred. 
 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development costs consist primarily of employee-related costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and other expenses. It also includes the cost of annotating data pipelines for AI, the cost of building and maintaining our own AI servers for training and the cloud costs for production deployments. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and products. 
 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily include expenditures related to advertising, channel partner incentives, media, promotional and bundling costs, brand awareness activities, business development, corporate partnerships and allocated overhead costs. These expenses are a reflection of our efforts to expand our market reach for distributing insurance policies. Sales and marketing expenses also consist of employee-related costs directly associated with our sales and marketing activities, including salaries, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. 
 We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer base and increase the awareness of end customers about our products. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future. While we expect our sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long-term, our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for executive, finance, legal, human resources, IT, and facilities personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, and allocated overhead costs. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth due to additional costs associated with legal, accounting, compliance, insurance, investor relations, and other costs as we operate as a public company. While we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long-term, our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization reflects the recognition of the cost of our tangible and intangible assets over their useful life. Depreciation expenses relate to equipment, hardware and purchased software. Amortization relates to investments related to recent acquisitions, internal software development and investments made in intellectual property development. Depreciation and amortization are expected to increase slightly in dollar amount over time but will likely decrease as a percentage of revenue as investments in platform technology reach scale. 
 
 Fair Value Changes in Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value 
 Our outstanding notes and warrants are financial liabilities measured at fair value with fair value changes recognized in profit or loss. We carry out a periodic fair valuation exercise and recognize the increase or decrease in the carrying values of these financial instruments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such fair value changes are primarily driven by changes in our equity value, risk free interest rates and credit risk premia. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with definite life 
 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles can arise from various factors, including economic fluctuations, industry changes, technological advancements, and evolving customer preferences. When the carrying value of these assets exceeds their recoverable amount, 
 41 

impairment occurs, leading to a decrease in reported value on our financial statements. Recognizing and addressing impairment in a timely and effective manner is essential. Regular assessments and impairment tests are necessary to identify potential impairments and determine the recoverable amount of these assets. 
 
 Income Tax Expense/(Benefit) 
 Income tax expense/(benefit) consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of finance costs, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other items from reported net profit or loss. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA aids investors by providing an operating profit/loss without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization and certain other items to help clarify sustainability and trends affecting the business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Limitations and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under U.S. GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. These limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our incorporation, we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity, convertible instruments, debt (including working capital lines), and customer payments. As of September 30, 2024, we have raised an aggregate of 43.2 million, net of issuance costs, through the issuance of preferred stock of Roadzen (DE) and the issuance of convertible and non-convertible instruments. Our accumulated deficit stood at 222.3 million as of September 30, 2024, up from 151.5 million from March 31, 2024. These accumulated deficits stem from substantial operating losses which amounted to 41.6 million and 36.1 million, fair valuation losses of 55.4 million and 37.1 million, RSU vesting expenses of 103.3 million and 56.3 million, transaction costs arising from the Business Combination of 17.7 million and 17.7 million, and impairment of investment and intangible assets of 4.3 million and 4.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to experience operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations over an extended period due to the planned investments in our business. Consequently, we may need to secure additional capital resources to support the execution of our strategic initiatives for growing our business in the coming years. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers, the continued market acceptance of our solutions, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services and technologies. We will be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Senior Secured Mizuho Notes 
 On June 30, 2023, Roadzen entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement") with Mizuho Securities USA LLC Mizuho ), as administrative agent and collateral agent, and as a purchaser, pursuant to which Mizuho purchased an aggregate principal amount of 7,500,000 of senior secured notes (the "Mizuho Notes"). The Mizuho Notes bear interest at a rate of 15.0 per annum, which will automatically increase by 5 if we fail to prepay the Mizuho Notes upon the occurrence of certain mandatory prepayment events as set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement. The Mizuho Notes were originally scheduled to mature on June 30, 2024. On June 30, 2024, Mizuho granted to the Company a waiver of payment until July 31, 2024. On July 26, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the senior secured notes, providing for an additional 4 million in principal amount to a total of 11.5 million, and an extension of the maturity date to December 31, 2024. Terms of the notes are otherwise the same as the original notes issued in June 2023, including an interest rate of 15 per annum, and did not require any additional warrants. 
 As a condition precedent to closing under the Note Purchase Agreement, Roadzen entered into a Security Agreement, pursuant to which each of the Loan Parties, as defined therein, granted a first priority lien on substantially all of Roadzen's assets to Mizuho, as administrative agent and collateral agent. 
 Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, because the Mizuho Notes were not repaid in full by December 30, 2023, we became obligated to issue to the noteholders, warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares equal to 2.5 of the ownership interests of Roadzen on a 
 48 

fully diluted basis as of June 30, 2023, the date of the closing on the Note Purchase Agreement (the Mizuho Warrants ). The shares underlying the Mizuho Warrants are referred to herein as the Mizuho Warrant Shares. On May 14, 2024, the Company issued the Mizuho Warrants representing a right to purchase 1,432.517 Ordinary Shares at a purchase price of 0.001 per share. The Mizuho Warrants will expire five (5) years after issuance or earlier upon a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the issuer. The number of Mizuho Warrant Shares underlying and the applicable exercise price of the Mizuho Warrants are subject to customary adjustment for dividends, splits, reclassifications and other modifications. The Note Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Loan Parties ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, create liens, incur indebtedness, make payments and investments and transact with affiliates. Additionally, the Loan Parties are collectively required to maintain a cash reserve of at least 1 million in the aggregate to satisfy the minimum liquidity condition as set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement. 
 The Note Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default, if not cured or waived, would result in the acceleration of substantially all of the outstanding debt and interest owed under the Mizuho Notes (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) and default interest of an additional two percent (2.0 for so long as an event of default is continuing. 
 December 2023 Junior Unsecured Convertible Debenture 
 On December 15, 2023, the Company issued a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "December 2023 Convertible SPA"), among the Company and the investors party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the terms of the December 2023 Convertible SPA, the Company may issue and sell an aggregate of up to 50 million in principal amount of convertible debentures (the December 2023 Convertible Debentures ), on a private placement basis (collectively, the December 2023 Private Placement ). The Company held an initial closing of the December 2023 Private Placement, at which it received 400,000 in proceeds on December 15, 2023. On January 19, 2024, the Company issued an additional convertible debenture under the December 2023 Convertible SPA in the principal amount of 500,000 to Supurna VedBrat (the VedBrat Debenture ), a director of the Company, for a purchase price equal to the principal amount of the VedBrat Debenture. Also on January 19, 2024, Ms. VedBrat became a party to the December 2023 Convertible SPA and entered into a letter agreement with the Company (the Letter Agreement with respect to her investment in the Company pursuant to the VedBrat Debenture.

The Debentures are convertible into the Company s Ordinary Shares, at the election of the holder at any time at an initial conversion price of 10.00 per Ordinary Share (the Conversion Price ). The Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like. In addition, if the average volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares for the 30 trading days immediately preceding December 15, 2024 (the Average VWAP is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, the Conversion Price will be adjusted to an amount equal to such Average VWAP, subject to a floor of 85 of the Conversion Price then in effect. The Company has the right to require the Debentures to be converted into Ordinary Shares if the closing price of the Ordinary Shares exceeds 130 of the then-applicable Conversion Price for any 20 trading days within a consecutive 30 trading day-period. 
 The indebtedness evidenced by the December 2023 Convertible Debentures is subordinate to all other indebtedness of the Company.

The March 2024 SPA contains covenants by the Company, including requirements to cause each of its subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) to guaranty the Company s obligations under the 2024 SPA Notes and to take certain actions required to grant the 2024 Purchasers perfected security interests in the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to the existing liens of Mizuho). Pursuant to the terms of the March 2024 SPA, the Company and the 2024 Purchasers will enter into the Buyer Security Documents as defined in the March 2024 SPA. 
 The 2024 SPA Notes bear interest at a rate of 17.5 per annum and mature on the six-month anniversary of funding of the respective note (the Initial Rate Adjustment Date ). Interest is payable in cash or in kind, at the option of the Company, on each three-month anniversary of funding through the Initial Rate Adjustment Date (after which date all interest is payable in cash unless the parties agree to payment in kind). The Company s failure to repay all principal and accrued interest by the Initial Rate Adjustment Date would not constitute an event of default under the applicable 2024 SPA Note, however, the interest rate payable under such 2024 SPA Note would increase on such date to 19.5 per annum going forward, and thereafter would increase by an additional 200 basis points on each monthly anniversary of the Initial Rate Adjustment Date until each of the respective 2024 SPA Notes is paid in full, subject to a maximum interest rate of 29.5 per annum. Following the Initial Rate Adjustment Date, all unpaid principal and accrued interest would be payable within five business days of the holder s written demand. If any interest under the 2024 SPA Notes is paid in kind, such payment would be made through the issuance of that number of the Company s ordinary shares, 0.0001 par value per share Ordinary Shares ), calculated by dividing the amount payable by the lowest of (i) 8.00, (ii) the volume-weighted average price VWAP of the Ordinary Shares over the 60 trading days ending three trading days prior to the interest payment date, (iii) the opening price per share of the Ordinary Shares in any public offering of Ordinary Shares after the issuance of the respective 2024 SPA Notes, and (iv) the price per Ordinary Share after market close on the first day of trading following any such public offering of Ordinary Shares. 
 The indebtedness evidenced by the 2024 SPA Notes is intended to rank senior to all outstanding and future indebtedness of the Company, other than the Company s outstanding indebtedness to Mizuho, and is to be secured pursuant to the Buyer Security Documents. The 2024 SPA Notes contain covenants of the Company that, among other things, prohibit the Company from incurring additional indebtedness or liens, subject to certain exceptions, for so long as the 2024 SPA Notes are outstanding. The 2024 SPA Notes contain customary events of default, including certain defaults in payment or performance and certain events of bankruptcy. 
 Also pursuant to the terms of the March 2024 SPA, the Company agreed to issue to each Purchaser warrants (the March 2024 SPA Warrants to purchase, for each 10,000 in original principal amount of 2024 SPA Notes purchased, 1,000 Ordinary Shares. Each of the March 2024 SPA Warrant will be exercisable at any time during the period commencing on March 28, 2025 (the Vesting Date through March 28, 2031 (or until the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, if earlier). The exercise price of the March 2024 SPA Warrants is equal to 80 of the lower of (i) the VWAP of the Company s Ordinary Shares (RZDN), as reported on the relevant market or exchange, over the 60 trading days subsequent to the first loan funding, (ii) the opening price of any public offering of straight equity securities of the Company occurring within six months after the issue date of the March 2024 SPA Warrants and (iii) the VWAP of the Ordinary Shares over the 60 trading days immediately prior to the Vesting Date. The March 2024 SPA Warrants have customary anti-dilution protections in the event the Company declares dividends or distributions on the Ordinary Shares or subdivides, combines or reclassifies its outstanding Ordinary Shares. On April 22, 2024, the Company issued March 2024 SPA Warrants to purchase 50,000 Ordinary Shares to Krishnan-Shah Family Partners, LP. On June 20, 2024, the Company issued March 2024 SPA Warrants to purchase 50,000 Ordinary Shares to Ms. VedBrat and the Company expects to issue March 2024 SPA Warrants to purchase an additional 50,000 Ordinary Shares to Ms. VedBrat in connection with her purchase of the May 2024 Note. 
 Secured, Non-Convertible 2022 Debentures 
 One of our material subsidiaries issued Secured, Non-Convertible Debentures with NP1 Capital Trust with an aggregate principal amount of 3.7 million during the FY. 22-23 with varying maturity dates between January 2024 and July 2024 and interest rates ranging from 19.25 to 20.00 per annum. The principal outstanding as on September 30, 2024 is 2.22 million. On September 30, 2024 the Company entered into an amendment agreement restructuring the principal repayments and extending the maturity date to March 31, 2025. 
 
 Debt Exchange 
 
 50 

In July 2024, the Company announced it was kicking off a balance sheet reconstitution program aimed at strengthening and simplifying its balance sheet, while addressing the legacy overhang inherited through the going-public process. To start this program, the Company agreed to convert 2.5 million of its accounts payables and 0.9 million of its short term borrowings due to entities affiliated with its Chairman and CEO into equity. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 
 We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 
 The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company has elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, the Company will not be subject to the same implementation timeline for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies which may make comparison of the Company s financial statements to those of other public companies more difficult. 
 Net Income (Loss) per Ordinary Share 
 The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. 
 The calculation of diluted income per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the Company's outstanding warrants since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted net income per ordinary share is the same as basic net income per ordinary share for the periods presented. 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantit ative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result, pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 ITEM 4. C ontrols and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions 
 51 

regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PA RT II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGA L PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 From time to time, we may be subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceeding against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. 
 IT EM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K we filed with the SEC on July 1, 2024 which are incorporated herein by reference. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 Recent actions by the FCA could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The U.K.'s financial regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") has recently conducted a comprehensive review of the Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) product, a key contributor to our operations in the UK, resulting in a directive for all insurers, including our insurance partner, to temporarily cease selling the GAP product in February 2024. The regulator has mandated that insurers make a resubmission, or new GAP proposal, outlining the product features, coverages and pricing for approval by the FCA before sales of the GAP product can be resumed. 
 
 As our insurance partner is obligated to adhere to FCA guidelines, any delay or challenges in them obtaining FCA approval of their resubmission may have a negative impact on our business. The resubmission process introduces uncertainty, as there is no guarantee of swift regulatory approval. The temporary suspension of GAP sales has had, and may continue in the future to have a significant impact on our revenue, financial performance, and overall profitability. We are actively working with our insurance partner to address the concerns raised by the regulator, expedite the resubmission process, and seek timely FCA approval to resume GAP sales, however, there can be no assurance that the resubmission will receive prompt regulatory approval. Continued delays in obtaining approval may result in prolonged disruption to our business operations, potential reputation damage, and potential loss of clients and customer confidence. Additionally, the resubmission process may require adjustments to the GAP product, potentially increasing our costs and decreasing our profit margin and any delays or unfavorable outcomes may materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 ITEM 2. UNRE GISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
 Other than as previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K, none. 
 ITEM 3. DEF AULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES. 
 None. 
 ITEM 4. M INE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. 
 Not applicable.
