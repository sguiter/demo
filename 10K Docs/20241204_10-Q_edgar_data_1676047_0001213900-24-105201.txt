Overview 

AVERSA transdermal abuse deterrent technology. 

Our primary business is the development of a portfolio
of transdermal pharmaceutical products. Our lead product is our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system which will require approval
from the Food and Drug Administration FDA and substantial additional capital for research and development. Our abuse deterrent
transdermal product under development has the potential to provide clinicians and patients with an extended-release transdermal fentanyl
product for use in managing chronic pain requiring around the clock opioid therapy combined with properties designed to deter the abuse
and misuse of fentanyl patches. In addition, we believe that our abuse deterrent technology can be broadly applied to various transdermal
products and our strategy is to follow the development of our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system with the development of abuse
deterrent transdermal products for pharmaceuticals that have risks or a history of abuse. We received on January 28, 2022, an Issue Notification
from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for our United States patent entitled, Abuse and Misuse Deterrent Transdermal
System, that protects our Aversa technology platform. 

25 

Through October 31, 2018, our business was the
development of a line of consumer and health products that are delivered through a transdermal or topical patch. Following our acquisition
of 4P Therapeutics on August 1, 2018, our focus expanded to include prescription pharmaceuticals, and we are seeking to develop and seek
FDA approval on a number of transdermal pharmaceutical products under development by 4P Therapeutics. 

Most of our planned consumer products require
FDA approval for sale in the United States, and we have not sought to obtain, and we do not plan to seek to obtain, FDA approval to market
these products in the United States at this time. Following our acquisition of selected assets from Pocono Coated Products, LLC Pocono ),
we are primarily focused on providing contract manufacturing services and consulting services to 3 rd party brands with no intention
at this time to launch our own consumer products. 

4P Therapeutics has not generated any revenue
from any of its products under development. Rather, prior to our acquisition, 4P Therapeutics generated revenue to provide cash for its
operations through contract research and development and related services for a small number of clients in the life sciences field on
an as-needed basis. We are, for the near term, continuing this activity, although we do not anticipate that it will generate significant
revenues and, since our acquisition, it has generated minor gross margins. We have no long-term contractual obligations, and either party
can terminate at any time. 

With the change in our focus, our capital requirements
have increased substantially. The process of developing pharmaceutical products and submitting them for FDA approval is both time consuming
and expensive, with no assurance of obtaining approval from the FDA to market our product in the United States. We will require approximately
 13 million for research and development of our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system, including clinical manufacturing and clinical
trials that need to be completed to obtain FDA approval. However, the total cost could be substantially in excess of that amount. 

On August 31, 2020, the Company closed the purchase
of all of the assets of Pocono Coated Products PCP associated with its Transdermal, Topical, Cosmetic and Nutraceutical
business (the Assets ). pursuant to a Purchase Agreement Agreement ), entered into on August 31, 2020. The
purchase price for the Assets was (i) 6,000,000 paid in shares of the Company s common stock at a value of the average price of
the previous 90 days at the date of Closing (the Shares and (ii) a promissory note of the Company in the principal amount
of 1,500,000, which note was repaid in full in October 2021. Subsequent to the repayment of the note, on October 25, 2021, the Shares
were released from escrow. 

On October 5, 2021, the Company, having been approved
for the listing of its common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market effective October 1, 2021, consummated a public offering (the IPO of units (the Units ), of common stock and warrants that were offered in the IPO on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which included
1,231,200 (each a Unit ), each Unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, and one warrant
(each a Warrant at a price of 5.36 per Unit. Each Warrant is immediately exercisable, entitles the holder to purchase
one share of common stock at an exercise price of 6.43 and will expire five (5) years from the date of issuance. The underwriters 
over-allotment option was exercised for 184,800 warrants to purchase shares of common stock bringing the total net proceeds to the Company
from the IPO to 5,836,230. The shares of common stock and Warrants were separately transferred immediately upon issuance. As of October
31, 2024, 457,794 Warrants issued in the IPO have been exercised, with net proceeds to the Company of 2,942,970. 

26 

On November 1, 2021, The Board of Directors adopted
the 2021 Employee Stock Option Plan (the Plan ). The Company has reserved 408,333 shares to issue and sell upon the exercise
of stock options issued under the Plan. On November 3, 2021, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-8, to register under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the 408,333 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan, and on October 12, 2022,
a Post-Effective Amendment to the Form S-8 was filed with the SEC. In accordance with the Plan, on February 1, 2022, the Company reserved
an additional 233,333 shares and on February 1, 2023, the Company reserved an additional 233,333 shares. On March 20, 2024, our Board
of Directors adopted an amendment to the Company s 2021 Employees Stock Option Plan (the Plan increasing the
number of shares of common stock subject to the plan (as of March 20, 2024 875,000 shares) to 1,400,00 shares (the Amendment ).
The plan adopted by the Board on November 1, 2021, provided for an initial 350,000 shares to issue and sell upon the exercise of
stock options issued under the Plan. The Plan provides for an automatic annual increase to be added on February 1 of each year equal
to the lesser of (i) 250,000 shares of Common Equity or (ii) five percent (5 of the total shares of Common Stock outstanding
on such date (including for this purpose any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any outstanding capital equity of the
Company) or (iii) such lesser number as determined by the Board. We will submit the Amendment to the Plan to our stockholders for
adoption and approval at the 2025 Annual Meeting. If the Amendment is not approved by stockholders within one year of adoption by the
increase in shares subject to the Plan will be void, together with any options issued following March 20, 2024, in the period pending
approval of the Plan by our stockholders. As of October 31, 2024, 75,166 shares remain available for issuance of options under the Plan. 

The Company received a favorable verdict on July
13, 2022 from the Circuit Court, Orange County, Florida, providing for rescission of the Company s 2017 acquisition of Advanced
Health Brands and recovery by the Company of the 1,400,000 shares (adjusted for a 1-for-4 reverse stock split effective June 23, 2019
and the 7-for-six forward stock split effective August 15, 2022) of common stock issued in the acquisition, effectively allowing the Company
on July 25, 2022 to cancel 1.4M shares of common stock held by the defendants. 

On July 26, 2022, our Board of Directors approved
the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effect a 7 for 6 forward stock split (the Stock Split of our outstanding
common stock. We filed the amendment set forth in a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada on August 4, 2022. The
7:6 forward split was effective for trading purposes on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 12, 2022. Each shareholder of record as of
the August 15, 2022 record date received one (1) additional share of common stock for each six (6) shares held as of the record date.
No fractional shares of common stock were issued in connection with the Stock Split. Instead, all shares were rounded up to the next whole
share. In connection with the Stock Split, which did not require shareholder approval under the Nevada corporation law, the number of
authorized shares of common stock of the Company increased in the same ratio as the shares of outstanding common stock were increased
in the Stock Split, from 250,000,000 authorized shares to 291,666,666 authorized shares. 

The Company on July 13, 2023, entered into an
amended three-year 5,000,000 credit line facility (replacing the 2,000,000 facility that we had entered into on March 19, 2023), drawdowns
under which bear interest at the rate of 7 per annum. The credit line provides the Company with available financing through the FDA approval
process and into commercial scale manufacturing, for the Company s patented lead product, AVERSA Fentanyl, an abuse-deterrent
fentanyl transdermal system. 

On December 27, 2023, the Company issued 1,026,720
shares of common stock in conversion of the outstanding 2,000,000 principal amount, plus accrued interest for the Credit Line Note of
the Company held TII Jet Services LDA; and on May 14, 2024, TII Jet Services agreed to convert an additional 300,000 of principal of
the Credit Line Note plus accrued interest at a conversion price of 4.00 per share, in exchange for the issuance of 76,230 shares of
common stock. The fair value of the common stock at the date of issuance was 3.71 per share, which resulted a gain on the settlement
of debt of 22,109. 

On April 19, 2024, the Company completed an 8,400,000
equity financing with European investors (the Offering of 2,100,000 units Units ), at a price of 4.00 per
Unit, each Unit consisting of one share of common stock Shares and a Warrant to purchase two Shares of common stock, the
Warrants having an initial exercise price of 6.43, are exercisable by payment of the exercise price in cash only and expire April 19,
2029, five years from the date of issuance. The Offering was made solely to investors resident outside the United States and was not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or the securities laws of any jurisdiction, including
any jurisdiction outside the United States, but was made privately by the Company pursuant to the exemptions from registration provided
in the SEC s Regulation S and other exemptions under the Securities Act.

Results of Operations 

Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 

For the three months ended October 31, 2024, we
generated revenue of 645,796 and our costs of revenue were 454,767. For the three months ended October 31, 2023, we generated revenue
of 427,841 and our costs of revenue were 268,920. Our revenue for October 31, 2024, was derived from sales from contract manufacturing
services performed in our Pocono Pharmaceuticals (Active Intelligence) segment and -0- from contract research and development services
from our 4P Therapeutics segment. The revenue from the Transdermal Patches segment increased from the prior year as the Company ordered
additional equipment to meet the new demand and implemented this equipment during the third quarter. An increase in demand is expected
in the balance of the current year. The Company s contract with Sorrento Therapeutics was completed and 4P Therapeutics devoted
most of its time to the development of its Aversa product. Our cost of revenue for our contract research and development services represents
our labor cost plus a modest amount of material costs which we passed on to the client. 

For the three months ended October 31, 2024, our
selling, general and administrative expenses were 737,102 primarily legal, accounting and administrative salaries and non-cash compensation
from the issuance of employee stock options compared to 1,330,929 for the three months ended October 31, 2023.The decrease from 2023
is primarily attributable to decreases in professional fees and non-cash equity-based expenses. 

During the three months ended October 31, 2024,
the Company incurred research and development expenses of its Aversa Fentanyl product of 880,768, primarily of salaries and increases
in development costs from Kindeva as compared to 551,503 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. 

We incurred interest expenses of 4,031 for the
three months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to 40,200 for the three months ended October 31, 2024. The decrease is primarily due
to the decrease in the Company s related party loans. 

Interest income for the three months ended October
31, 2024 was 68,235 as compared to 3,765 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to investment of
excess cash from the Company s equity financing. 

As a result of the foregoing, we sustained a net
loss of 1,362,637 or (0.12) per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared with a loss of 1,759,940,
or (0.22) per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended October 31, 2023. 

Nine Months Ended
October 31, 2024 and 2023 

For the nine months ended
October 31, 2024, we generated revenue of 1,497,158 and our costs of revenue were 1,039,785 resulting in a gross margin of 457,373.
For the nine months ended October 31, 2023, we generated revenue of 1,560,701 and our costs of revenue were 879,824, resulting in a
gross margin of 680,877. Our revenue for October 31, 2024, was derived from sales from our Transdermal Patches segment and -0- from
contract services from our 4P Therapeutics segment. The revenue from the Transdermal Patches segment decreased from the prior year. An
increase in demand is expected in the subsequent quarter. Our cost of revenue for our contract research and development services represents
our labor cost plus a modest amount of material costs which we passed on to the client. Our cost of sales decreased during the period
for our contract services in comparison to the prior year as our main contract has been completed and the balance of the contract is being
recognized with limited additional costs. 

For the nine months ended
October 31, 2024, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 2,554,155 primarily legal, accounting and non-cash compensation
compared to 2,849,399 for the nine months ended October 31, 2023.The decrease from 2023 is primarily attributable to a decrease in investor
relations expenses and professional fees. 

During the nine months
ended October 31, 2024, the Company incurred research and development expenses of its Aversa Fentanyl product of 2,629,278 primarily
of salaries and increases in development costs from Kindeva as compared to 1,397,055 for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. 

We incurred interest
expense of 17,668 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024, as compared to 52,601 for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. The
decrease is primarily due to the decrease in the Company s related party debt. 

28 

Interest income for the
nine months ended October 31, 2024 was 145,585 as compared to 13,830 for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. The increase is primarily
due to the investment of excess cash from the Company s equity financing. 

During the nine months
ended October 31, 2024, the Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 368,036 in connection with the issuance of common stock
and warrants to a related party debtor.

we sustained a net loss of 4,966,179 or 0.48)per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared with
a loss of 3,604,348, or 0.46 per share (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of October 31, 2024, we had 5,698,187 in cash
and cash equivalents and working capital of 4,943,816, as compared with cash and cash equivalents of 492,942 and working capital of
 22,770 as of January 31, 2024. 

For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, we
used cash of 3,387,320 in our operations. The principal adjustments to our net loss of 4,966,179 were depreciation and amortization
of 212,199, the issuance of employee stock options and warrants for services in the amount of 686,685 and the loss on extinguishment
of debt of 368,036. 

For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, we
used cash in investing activities of 92,043 primarily for the purchase of equipment. 

For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, we
provided cash in financing activities of 8,684,608 primarily from the proceeds of 8,400,000 from the sale of common stock and warrants
and 300,000 from its line of credit. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Going Concern Assessment 

Management assesses liquidity and going concern
uncertainty in the Company s condensed financial statements to determine whether there is sufficient cash on hand and working capital,
including available borrowings on loans, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date the consolidated financial statements
are issued or available to be issued, which is referred to as the look-forward period , as defined in GAAP. As part of this
assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to management, management will consider various scenarios, forecasts,
projections, estimates and will make certain key assumptions, including timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs,
its ability to delay or curtail expenditures or programs and its ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, among other factors.
Based on this assessment, as necessary or applicable, management makes certain assumptions around implementing curtailments or delays
in the nature and timing of programs and expenditures to the extent it deems probable those implementations can be achieved and management
has the proper authority to execute them within the look-forward period. 

As of October 31, 2024, the Company had cash and
cash equivalents of 5,698,187 and working capital of 4,934,816. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net
loss from operations of 4,726,060 and used cash flow from operations of 3,387,320. The Company has generated operating losses since
its inception and has relied on sales of securities and issuance of third-party and related-party debt to support cash flow from operations.
The Company has used these proceeds to fund operations and will continue to use the funds as needed. In March 2023, the Company entered
into a three-year 2,000,000 Credit Line Note facility with a related party, amended on July 13, 2023, to 5,000,000, which will permit
the Company to draw down on the credit line to fund the Company s research and development of its Aversa product. On April 19, 2024,
the Company received proceeds of 8,400,000 from an equity financing with European investors. 

29 

Management has prepared estimates of operations
for the next twelve months and believes that sufficient funds will be generated from operations to fund its operations for one year from
the date of the filing of these condensed consolidated financial statements, which indicates improved operations and the Company s
ability to continue operations as a going concern. 

Management believes the substantial doubt about
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is alleviated by the above assessment. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements of the Company
include the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The operations
of 4P Therapeutics are included in the Company s financial statements from the date of acquisition of August 1, 2018, and the operations

The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates including, but not limited to, those related
to such items as income tax exposures, accruals, depreciable/useful lives, allowance for doubtful accounts and valuation allowances. The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ASU 2014-09 ), which amends the accounting standards for
revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled
when products are transferred to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue based on the five criteria for revenue recognition established
under Topic 606: 1) identify the contract, 2) identify separate performance obligations, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate
the transaction price among the performance obligations, and 5) recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. 

Revenue Types 

The following is a description of the
Company s revenue types, which include professional services and sale of goods: 

Contract
development and manufacturing services for consumer health transdermal, topical and tape products with revenues listed under sale of
goods. 

Product revenues derived from the sale of the Company s consumer transdermal, topical and tape products with sales listed under sale of goods. 

Contract research and development services for pharmaceutical and medical devices for life sciences customers with revenues listed under services. 

30 

Contracts with Customers 

A contract with a customer exists when
(i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party s rights regarding the goods or services to be
transferred and identifies the payment terms related to these goods or services, (ii) the contract has commercial substance and, (iii)
we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for services that are transferred is probable based on the customer s
intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. 

Contract Liabilities 

Deferred revenue is a liability related
to a revenue producing activity for which revenue has not been recognized. The Company records deferred revenue when it receives consideration
from a contract before achieving certain criteria that must be met for revenue to be recognized in conformity with GAAP. 

Performance Obligations 

A performance obligation is a promise
in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in the new revenue standard. The contract
transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation
is satisfied. For the Company s different revenue service types, the performance obligation is satisfied at different times. The
Company s performance obligations include providing products and professional services in the area of research. The Company recognizes
product revenue performance obligations in most cases when the product has shipped to the customer. When we perform professional service
work, we recognize revenue when we have the right to invoice the customer for the work completed, which typically occurs over time on
a monthly basis for the work performed during that month. 

All revenue recognized in the income
statement is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers. 

Cash and cash equivalents. 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash
on hand, cash on deposit in money market accounts. The Company considers short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity
date of three months or less that are not part of an investment pool to be cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had 5,171,000
that exceeded federally insured limits. 

Accounts receivable 

Trade accounts receivables are recorded
at the net invoice value and are not interest bearing. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from
the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company determines its allowances by both specific identification of customer
accounts where appropriate and the application of historical loss to non-applicable accounts. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024,
and 2023, the Company recorded bad debt expenses of 1,200 and 11,836, respectively, for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable.
During the year ended January 31, 2024, the Company entered into an accounts receivable sale agreement for one of its subsidiaries. The
Company received 106,528 in funds against an account receivable that is currently a claim in bankruptcy. The net accounts receivable
remain on the books of the Company and a corresponding amount has been included as a secured borrowing liability under Notes payable.
As of October 31, 2024, the receivable has been reserved in full. If the bankruptcy claim is not paid in full by the debtor, Company is
obligated to pay any difference to the factor. The loan bears interest at 10 . The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 during 2013 and implemented
the guidance on expected credit losses. 

31 

Inventories 

Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost and reasonable value determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Net realized value is the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. The cost of finished goods and work in process is comprised
of material costs, direct labor costs and other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). As
of October 31, 2024, total inventory was 168,299, consisting of work-in-process of 31,418, finished goods of 966 and raw materials
of 135,914. As of January 31, 2024, total inventory was 168,605, consisting of work-in-process of 7,466, finished goods of 8,707 and
raw materials of 134,691. 

Property, Plant and Equipment 

Property and equipment represent an
important component of the Company s assets. The Company depreciates its plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the assets. Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost. Expenditures for minor repairs, maintenance and
replacement parts which do not increase the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred. All major additions and improvements
are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The lives over which the fixed assets are depreciated range
from 3 to 20 years as follows: 

Lab Equipment 
 5-10 years 
 
 Furniture and fixtures 
 3 years 
 
 Machinery and equipment 
 10-20 years 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets include trademarks,
intellectual property and customer base acquired through business combinations. The Company accounts for Other Intangible Assets under
the guidance of ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The Company capitalizes certain costs related to patent technology.
A substantial component of the purchase price related to the Company s acquisitions have also been assigned to intellectual property
and other intangibles. Under the guidance, other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. Trademarks, intellectual property and customer base are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives of ten years. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the difference between
the total purchase price and the fair value of assets (tangible and intangible) and liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is
reviewed for impairment annually on January 31, and more frequently as circumstances warrant, and written down only in the period in which
the recorded value of such assets exceeds their fair value. The Company does not amortize goodwill in accordance with ASC 350. In connection
with the Company s acquisition of 4P Therapeutics LLC in 2018, the Company recorded Goodwill of 1,719,235. On August 31, 2020,
in connection with the Company s acquisition of Pocono Coated Products LLC and Active Intelligence LLC, the Company recorded Goodwill
of 5,810,640. During the years ended January 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge of -0- and 327,326, respectively,
reducing the Active Intelligence LLC Goodwill to 3,302,478. As of October 31, 2024, and January 31, 2024, Goodwill amounted to 5,021,713
and 5,021,713, respectively. 

Long-lived Assets 

Management reviews long-lived assets
for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The
carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result
from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between
the fair market value of the long-lived asset and the related book value. 

32 

Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share of common stock
is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding
options and common stock purchase warrants. As of October 31, 2024, and 2023, there were 6,922,833 and 2,157,873 common stock equivalents
outstanding, that were not included in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

ASC 718, Compensation - Stock
Compensation, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services,
and, since February 1, 2019, non-employees, are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue
shares, options and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments
to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on
their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for
the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). As of February 1, 2019, pursuant to ASC 2018-07, ASC 718
was applied to stock-based compensation for both employees and non-employees. 

Business Combinations 

The Company recognizes the assets acquired,
the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values
as of that date, with limited exceptions specified in the accounting literature. In accordance with this guidance, acquisition-related
costs, including restructuring costs, must be recognized separately from the acquisition and will generally be expensed as incurred. That
replaces the cost-allocation process detailed in previous accounting literature, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated
to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value. 

Leases 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to provide a new comprehensive model for lease accounting
under this guidance, lessees and lessors should apply a right-of-use model in accounting for all leases (including subleases)
and eliminate the concept of operating leases and off-balance-sheet leases. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will
depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Similar modifications have been made to lessor accounting in-line with revenue
recognition guidance. 

The
Company applies guidance for right-of-use accounting for all leases and records the operating lease liabilities on its balance sheet.
The Company completed the necessary changes to its accounting policies, processes, disclosure and internal control over financial reporting. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. 

Income Taxes 

Taxes are calculated in accordance with
taxation principles currently effective in the United States and Ireland. 

33 

The Company accounts for income taxes
under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets
and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

The Company records net deferred tax
assets to the extent they believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company
considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected
future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event the Company was to determine that
it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, the Company would make
an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure controls and procedures. 

As of the end of period covered by this report,
we carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, we concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms. 

Management has determined that our internal controls
contain material weaknesses due to the absence of segregation of duties, as well as lack of qualified accounting personnel, and excessive
reliance on third-party consultants for accounting, financial reporting and related activities. During the past fiscal year, we have added
qualified accounting personnel, so the Company does not have to rely on third-party consultants. The Company has established additional
monitoring controls over the financial statements. We have also improved our internal controls to provide for a detailed accounting review
of all revenue items and accounts receivable and accounts payable transactions in connection with the entry and categorization of each
transaction in the preparation of the Company s financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies and procedures may deteriorate. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. 

No changes were made to our internal controls
in the quarterly period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely materially to affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

With respect to legal proceedings that arise in
the ordinary course of business, when the Company becomes aware of a claim or potential claim, it assesses the likelihood of any loss
or exposure. In accordance with authoritative guidance, the Company records loss contingencies in its financial statements only for matters
in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. 

The Company is currently a defendant in a lawsuit
initiated by Joseph Gunnar, LLC Gunnar and Lucosky Brookman LLP LB in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, New York County, under Index No.654633/2023. The lawsuit alleges multiple allegations such as breach of contract, fraudulent
activities, and tortious interference and seeks damages following the Company s termination of an engagement letter for assistance
with a public stock offering. Gunnar is seeking over 500,000 in damages plus punitive damages, while LB is demanding reimbursement of
legal fees. 

In response, the Company denies all allegations,
alleging that the engagement letter was unenforceable, and its termination was legally justified. The Company has also initiated counterclaims
against Joseph Gunnar Co., accusing them of intentional interference and breach of fiduciary duty, and is seeking 1,000,000 for
each claim along with a declaratory judgment affirming the legality and justification of the termination. The plaintiffs have denied these
counterclaims. 

Currently, there are no pending hearings or motions
as both parties are engaged in discovery and are attempting to resolve the matter amicably. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

You should carefully consider the key risks
described below together with all of the other information included in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2024, before making an investment decision with regard to our securities. The risks set forth
below and in our Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist that could also adversely affect
our business, prospects or operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of
operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or a significant part
of your investment. 

Because we are an early-stage company with
minimal revenue and a history of losses and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, we cannot assure you that
we can or will be able to operate profitably. 

We did not generate any revenue prior to the quarter
ended October 31, 2018 and, since then, we have reported only modest revenue from our pharmaceutical transdermal patch business. We are
subject to the risks common to start-up, pre-revenue enterprises, including, among other factors, undercapitalization, cash shortages,
limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources and lack of revenues. Drug development companies typically incur
substantial losses during the product development and FDA testing phase of the business and do not generate revenues until after the drug
has received FDA approval, which cannot be assured, and until the company has started to sell the product. We can give no assurance that
we can or will ever be successful in achieving profitability and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of our early
stage of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to operate profitably or generate positive cash flow. If we cannot achieve
profitability, we may be forced to cease operations and you may suffer a total loss of your investment. 

35 

Because we do not have a product we can
market in the United States, we cannot predict when or whether we will operate profitably. 

We have not completed the development of our lead
product, which is our abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system, and we do not have any product that we can market in the United States.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop
and market any products or achieve or attain profitability. If we are able to obtain financing for our operations, we expect that we will
incur substantial expenses as we continue with our product development and clinical trials. Further, if we are required by applicable
regulatory authorities, including the FDA as well as the comparable regulatory agencies in other countries in which we may seek to market
product, to perform studies in addition to those we currently anticipate, our expenses will increase beyond expectations and the timing
of any potential product approval may be delayed. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow
for the foreseeable future. 

If any of
our potential products are approved for marketing but fail to achieve the broad degree of physician or market acceptance necessary for
commercial success, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. 

If any of the products
in our pipeline receives FDA approval thereby allowing us to market the product in the United States, it will be necessary for us to generate
acceptance of our product for the indications covered by the FDA approval. In order to generate acceptance in the marketplace, we will
need to demonstrate to physicians, patients and payors that our product provides a distinct advantage or better outcome at a price that
reflects the value of our product as compared with existing products. We will need to develop and implement a marketing program directed
at both physicians and the general public. Since we do not presently have the resources necessary to develop or implement an in-house
marketing program and we may not have the funds to do so if and when we obtain FDA approval to market our product, we will need to establish
a distribution network though license and distribution agreements with third parties who have the capability to market our product to
physicians, and we will be dependent upon the ability of these third parties to market our products effectively. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to negotiate license and distribution agreements with terms that are acceptable to us. Since we do not have an established
track record and our product pipeline is relatively small, we may be at a disadvantage in negotiating the terms of license and distribution
agreements. Further, we may have little control over the development and implementation of our licensee s marketing program, and
our licensees may have interests that are inconsistent with ours with respect to the allocation of resources and implementation of the
marketing program. We cannot assure you that a marketing program for any of our products can or will be implemented effectively or that
we will be successful in developing physician and emergency service acceptance of our products. 

The drug delivery
industry is subject to rapid technological change and, our failure to keep up with technological developments may impair our ability to
market our products. 

Our products use technology
which we developed for the transdermal delivery of drugs. The field of drug delivery is subject to rapid technological changes. Our future
success will depend upon our ability to keep abreast of the latest developments in the industry and to keep pace with advances in technology
and changing customer requirements. If we cannot keep pace with such changes and advances, our proposed products could be rendered obsolete,
which would result in our having to cease its operations. 

If we obtain FDA
approval, we will face significant competition from better known and better capitalized companies. 

If we obtain FDA approval
for any of our products, we expect to face significant competition from existing companies, which are better known and already have developed
relationships with physicians within the healthcare system. Any product we may develop will compete with existing medications performing
the same medicinal functions, which may include transdermal patches. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully.
In addition, even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, we may not be able to price them competitively with current
standard of care products or their price may drop considerably due to factors outside our control. If this happens or the price of materials
and manufacture increases dramatically, our ability to continue to operate our business would be materially harmed and we may be unable
to commercialize any products successfully. In addition, other pharmaceutical companies may be engaged in developing, patenting, manufacturing
and marketing products that compete with those that we are developing. These potential competitors may include large and experienced companies
that enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, such as greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, personnel and
marketing resources, greater brand recognition and more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and foreign
regulatory authorities. 

36 

Our stock price has
been and is likely to continue to be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid,
if at all. 

The trading price of
our common stock has experienced fluctuations due to the factors discussed in these risk factors section and elsewhere in this report.
In addition, the stock market in general has, and the NASDAQ Global Market and technology companies in particular have, experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations. These trading prices and valuations may not be sustainable. These broad market and industry factors may
decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods
of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often
been instituted against companies (primarily those that are larger than us) that experienced such volatility. This type of litigation,
if instituted against us, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention
and resources. 

Our business is impacted by the following additional
key risks : 

The
FDA regulatory process may take longer and be more expensive than we anticipate without any assurance that we will obtain FDA approval. 

If
we are not able to obtain FDA approval for our lead product, we may not have the resources to develop any other product, and we may not
be able to continue in business. 

We
may not be able to launch any products for which we receive FDA marketing approval. 

We
may not be able to establish a distribution network for the marketing and sale of any products for which we receive FDA approval. 

We
may not be able to establish manufacturing facilities in compliance with FDA good manufacturing practices or to enter into manufacturing
agreements for the manufacture of our products in an FDA approved manufacturing facility. 

It
may be necessary to us to enter into a joint venture or other strategic relationship in order to develop, perform clinical testing for,
manufacture or market any of our proposed products. We may not be able to enter into such a relationship, and any relationship may not
be successful, and the other party may have business interests and priorities that are different from ours. 

We
may be unable to accurately estimate anticipated expenses, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;
