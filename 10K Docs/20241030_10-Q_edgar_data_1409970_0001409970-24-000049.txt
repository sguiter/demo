 At September 30, 2024, the majority of the Company s AFS investment portfolio was comprised of senior asset-backed securities related to Structured Program transactions and U.S. agency-backed securities. Management considers U.S. agency-backed securities to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by certain U.S. government agencies. Most of the remaining securities in an unrealized loss position in the Company s AFS investment portfolio at September 30, 2024, were rated investment grade. Substantially all of these unrealized losses in the AFS investment portfolio were caused by interest rate increases. The Company does not intend to sell the investment portfolio, and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. For a description of management s quarterly evaluation of AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, see Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Annual Report.

 Commercial Lending Credit Quality Indicators 
 
 The Company evaluates the credit quality of its commercial loan portfolio based on regulatory risk ratings. The Company categorizes loans and leases into risk ratings based on relevant information about the quality and realizable value of collateral, if any, and the ability of obligors to service their debts, such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans and leases individually by classifying the loans and leases based on their associated credit risk and performs this analysis whenever credit is extended, renewed or modified, or when an observable event occurs indicating a potential decline in credit quality, and no less than annually for large balance loans. Risk rating classifications consist of the following: 
 
 Pass Loans and leases that the Company believes will fully repay in accordance with the contractual loan terms. 
 
 Special Mention Loans and leases with a potential weakness that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the Company s credit position at some future date. 
 
 Substandard Loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans and leases so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment and liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Normal payment from the borrower is in jeopardy, although loss of principal, while still possible, is not imminent.

 of unsecured personal loans at amortized cost as of period end 

During the third quarter of 2023, the Company expanded its digital channels to enable borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to qualify for a short-term payment reduction modification program. Under this program, borrowers may receive a temporary payment reduction for . If the borrower meets the temporary payment reduction requirements during the first term, they may qualify for a payment reduction for an additional . Receiving an additional of payment reduction is considered an other-than-insignificant payment delay and becomes a short-term payment reduction modification. The short-term payment reduction modification results in a term extension of five to compared to the original maturity date of the loan and does not include any principal or interest forgiveness. At the time of receiving a payment reduction, a delinquent loan resets to current status. However, if a borrower fails to comply with the modified terms, the delinquency status returns to the original contractual terms of the loan. Borrowers who were in their first three months of temporary payment reduction had a total of million of loan balances at amortized cost outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and may subsequently be eligible for a short-term payment reduction modification. 
 
 Permanent loan modifications include both a reduction in contractual interest rates and an extension to the contractual maturity date of up to and do not include any principal forgiveness. To qualify for this modification, borrowers must meet the Company s debt-to-income ratio requirements. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the weighted-average interest rate reduction under this program was approximately and , respectively. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the weighted-average interest rate reduction under this program was approximately and , respectively. The weighted-average maturity date extension was approximately for all periods. 
 
 Debt settlement modifications, which include engaging with third-party debt settlement companies, reduce the principal and interest amounts owed by borrowers. The Company typically charges-off such loans within a few months following the modification, as payments under the modified agreement are less than the original contractual amounts.

 Nonaccrual Assets 
 
 Nonaccrual loans and leases are those for which accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans and leases are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more, or earlier if management believes that the probability of collection does not warrant further accrual, and are charged-off no later than 120 days past due. 
 
 Certain loans on nonaccrual status may be considered collateral-dependent loans if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is expected to be substantially through sale or operation of the collateral. Expected credit losses for the Company s collateral-dependent loans are calculated as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, if applicable.

 Financial instruments are categorized in the valuation hierarchy based on the significance of observable or unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. For the financial instruments listed in the tables above that do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. These fair value estimates may also include observable, actively quoted components derived from external sources. As a result, changes in fair value for assets and liabilities within the Level 2 or Level 3 categories may include changes in fair value that were attributable to observable and unobservable inputs, respectively. The Company primarily uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the fair value of Level 3 instruments based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. This model uses inputs that are inherently judgmental and reflect the Company s best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate fair value. The Company did not transfer any assets or liabilities in or out of Level 3 during the third quarters and first nine months of 2024 or 2023. 
 
 The following significant unobservable inputs were used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 assets: 
 Discount rate The weighted-average rate at which the expected cash flows are discounted to arrive at the net present value of the loan. The discount rate is primarily determined based on marketplace investor return expectations. 
 Annualized net charge-off rate The annualized rate of average charge-offs, net of recoveries, expressed as a percentage of the average principal balance of loan pools with similar risk characteristics. The calculation

Loans Held for Investment at Fair Value 
 
 Loans HFI at fair value consists primarily of a loan portfolio acquired during the third quarter of 2024 with a billion outstanding principal balance. Due to the short remaining duration of the acquired loan portfolio, the Company has elected to account for the HFI loan portfolio under the fair value option. 
 
 The Company does not assume principal or interest rate risk on loans that were funded by its member payment-dependent self-directed retail program (Retail Program) because loan balances, interest rates and maturities are matched and offset by an equal balance of notes with the exact same interest rates and maturities. As such, the tables presented below exclude retail and certificate loans held for investment at fair value, which were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

With respect to PBRSU awards with an operating-based metric, the compensation expense of the award is set at the time of grant (assuming a target level of achievement), subsequently adjusted for actual performance during the performance period and expensed over the performance/vesting period.

For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of million and million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of and , respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the favorable impact of recurring items such as tax credits, the unfavorable impact of the non-deductible portions of executive compensation, and the net discrete impact of stock-based compensation. The decrease in effective tax rates for the 2024 periods compared to the same periods in 2023 is primarily due to the net discrete impact of stock-based compensation.

 Legal 
 
 The Company is subject to various claims brought in a litigation or regulatory context. These matters include lawsuits, including but not limited to, putative class action lawsuits and routine litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company, and its business practices and compliance with licensing and other regulatory requirements, is subject to periodic exams, investigations, inquiries or requests, enforcement actions and other proceedings from federal and state regulatory and/or law enforcement agencies, including from the federal banking regulators that directly regulate the Company and/or LC Bank. The majority of these claims and proceedings relate to or arise from alleged state or federal law and regulatory violations, or are alleged commercial disputes or consumer complaints. The Company accrues for costs related to contingencies when a loss from such claims is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss from a claim is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company reviews and evaluates its litigation and regulatory matters on at least a quarterly basis in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. If the Company determines an unfavorable outcome is not probable or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company does not accrue for a potential litigation loss. In those situations, the Company discloses an estimate or range of the reasonably possible losses, if such estimates can be made. 
 
 Regulatory Examinations and Actions Relating to the Company s Business Practices, Licensing and Compliance with Applicable Laws 
 
 The Company is and has been subject to periodic inquiries, exams and enforcement actions brought by federal and state regulatory agencies relating to the Company s business practices, the required licenses to operate its business, and operating in compliance with applicable laws, including the requirements of its licenses and the regulatory framework applicable to its business. 
 
 In the past, the Company has successfully resolved such matters in a manner that was not material to its results of financial operations in any period and that did not materially limit the Company s ability to conduct its business.

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides for a system of prompt corrective action (PCA). The PCA regime provides for capitalization categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically undercapitalized. An institution s PCA category is determined primarily by its regulatory capital ratios. The PCA requires remedial actions and imposes limitations that become increasingly stringent as its PCA capitalization category declines, including the ability to accept and/or rollover brokered deposits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s and LC Bank s regulatory capital ratios exceeded the thresholds required to be regarded as well-capitalized institutions and met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. There have been no events or conditions since September 30, 2024 that management believes would change the Company s categorization. 
 
 Federal laws and regulations limit the dividends that a national bank may pay. Dividends that may be paid by a national bank without the express approval of the OCC are limited to that bank s retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period. No dividends were declared by LC Bank during the first nine months of 2024 or during 2023. 
 
 Federal law restricts the amount and the terms of both credit and non-credit transactions between a bank and its nonbank affiliates. These covered transactions may not exceed 10 of the bank s capital and surplus (which for this purpose represents tier 1 and tier 2 capital, as calculated under the risk-based capital rules, plus the balance of the allowance for credit losses excluded from tier 2 capital) with any single nonbank affiliate and 20 of the bank s capital and surplus with all its nonbank affiliates. Covered transactions that are extensions of credit may require collateral to be pledged to provide added security to the bank.

 Overview 
 
 LendingClub operates a leading digital marketplace bank and is one of a small number of fintech companies with a national bank charter. We are building a new of kind of bank, one that aims to advantage our members with the information, tools, and guidance they need to achieve their own version of financial success. We do this by leveraging data and technology to increase access to credit, lower borrowing costs, and improve the return on savings all through a smart, simple, and rewarding digital experience. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 
 The following results for the third quarter of 2024 reflect growth in originations and improved loan sales pricing. In addition, d uring the third quarter of 2024, we acquired a loan portfolio with a 1.3 billion outstanding principal balance which drove growth in total assets. 
 
 Loan originations: Loan originations for the third quarter of 2024 increased 100.1 million, or 6 , sequentially and 404.8 million, or 27 , year over year. The increases were driven by an increase in unsecured personal loan origination volume combined with investor demand for Structured Certificates. 
 Loan originations held for investment (HFI) at amortized cost for the third quarter of 2024 increased 173.9 million, or 52 , sequentially and 183.3 million, or 56 , year over year. 
 Loan originations HFI at amortized cost as a percentage of loan originations was 27 and 19 for the third and second quarters of 2024, respectively, and 22 for the third quarter of 2023. The percentage of loan originations HFI in any period is dependent on many factors, including quarterly loan origination volume, risk-adjusted returns, liquidity and general regulatory capital considerations. 
 
 Total net revenue: Total net revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 14.6 million, or 8 , sequentially and 1.0 million, or 1 , year over year. 
 Marketplace revenue: Marketplace revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 2.0 million, or 4 , sequentially and decreased 2.5 million, or 4 , year over year. The sequential increase was primarily due to improved loan sales prices. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in loan balances serviced for others, partially offset by improved loan sales prices. In addition, both the sequential and year-over-year changes reflect a 7.7 million servicing asset write-off related to the loan portfolio purchase during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Net interest income: Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 increased 11.7 million, or 9 , sequentially and 3.2 million, or 2 , year over year. The increases were primarily due to growth in total interest-earning assets driven by the 1.3 billion loan portfolio purchase during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with growth in interest-bearing deposits. 
 Net interest margin: Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 5.63 , decreasing from 5.75 in the second quarter of 2024 and from 6.91 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Provision for credit losses: Provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 increased 12.0 million, or 34 , sequentially and decreased 16.9 million, or 26 , year over year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by an increase in initial provision from a higher volume of originated loans retained as HFI at amortized cost, partially offset by the impact of a 5.3 million provision in our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio due to one office loan, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding this one office loan, the CRE office loan portfolio balance was under 35 million as of September 30, 2024. The majority of office loans were originated prior to the Acquisition. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a higher quantitative and qualitative allowance in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in expected losses and a less favorable economic outlook, partially offset by an increase in the initial provision for credit losses from a higher volume of originated loans retained as HFI at amortized cost.

 (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

Total non-interest expense: Total non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased 4.1 million, or 3 , sequentially and 8.3 million, or 6 , year over year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing expense based on higher origination volume of marketplace loans and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense due to the workforce reduction plans we implemented in 2023. 
 
 Net income: Net income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 0.4 million, or 3 , sequentially and increased 9.4 million, or 189 , year over year. 
 
 Diluted earnings per share (EPS): Diluted EPS was 0.13 for both the third and second quarters of 2024 and 0.05 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Pre-provision net revenue (PPNR): Pre-provision net revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 10.6 million, or 19 , sequentially and decreased 7.3 million, or 10 , year over year. The sequential increase was driven by an increase in total net revenue, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. The year-over-year decrease was driven by an increase in non-interest expense. 
 
 Total assets: Total assets as of September 30, 2024 increased 1.5 billion, or 15 , sequentially and 2.6 billion, or 30 , year over year. The increases primarily reflect growth in loans held for investment at fair value, including the acquisition of a loan portfolio during the third quarter of 2024 with a 1.3 billion outstanding principal balance, securities related to our Structured Certificates program, and loans held for sale (HFS) related to our extended seasoning program. 
 
 Deposits: Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 billion, or 17 , sequentially, and 2.5 billion, or 35 , year over year. The increases primarily reflect growth in high-yield savings and certificates of deposit. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured deposits represent approximately 88 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024.

 We elected to account for HFS loans under the fair value option. With the election of the fair value option, origination fees, net fair value adjustments prior to the sales of the loans, and servicing asset gains on the sales of the loans, are reported as separate components within Marketplace revenue. 
 
 Origination Fees 
 
 Origination fees recorded as a component of marketplace revenue are primarily fees earned related to originating and issuing unsecured personal loans that are HFS. 
 
 The following tables present loan origination volume during each of the periods set forth below:

 Sequential: Origination fees were 71.5 million and 77.1 million for the third and second quarters of 2024, respectively, a decrease of 7 . 
 
 Year Over Year: Origination fees were 71.5 million and 60.9 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 17 . 
 
 Nine Months Over Nine Months : Origination fees were 218.7 million and 202.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 8 . 
 
 The changes in origination fees were primarily driven by the increase or decrease in the origination volume of marketplace loans. 
 
 Servicing Fees 
 
 We receive servicing fees to compensate us for servicing loans on behalf of investors, including managing payments from borrowers, collections and payments to those investors. Servicing fee revenue related to loans sold also includes the change in fair value of servicing assets associated with the loans. 
 
 The table below illustrates AUM serviced on our platform by the method in which the loans were financed as of the periods presented. Loans sold and subsequently serviced on behalf of the investor represent a key driver of our servicing fee revenue.

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

The decreases in servicing fees were primarily due to a decrease in loan balances serviced for others as well as a 7.7 million servicing asset write-off related to the loan portfolio purchase during the third quarter of 2024. In addition, the year over year and nine months over nine months decreases were also driven by a one-time benefit related to recouping volume-based purchase incentives during the third quarter of 2023 as well as an increase in the fair value of the servicing asset based on higher expected servicing fee revenue in 2023. 
 
 Gain on Sales of Loans 
 
 In connection with loan sales, we recognize a gain or loss on the sale of loans based on the level to which the contractual servicing fee is above or below an estimated market rate of servicing at the time of sale. Additionally, we recognize transaction costs, if any, as a loss on sale of loans. 
 
 The following tables present the unpaid principal balance of the volume of marketplace loans sold, which is a key driver of our gain on sales revenue, during each of the periods set forth below:

 The changes in the gain on sales of loans were primarily driven by the increase or decrease in the volume of marketplace loans sold. 
 
 Net Fair Value Adjustments 
 
 We record fair value adjustments on loans that are recorded at fair value, which include gains or losses from sale prices in excess of or less than the loan principal amount sold and realized net charge-offs. In addition, as loans are held on the Balance Sheet, incremental fair value loss adjustments on the loans are recorded in Net fair value adjustments within Marketplace revenue, whereas the associated interest income, based on the loans contractual interest rate, is recorded within Net interest income. 
 
 Sequential: Net fair value adjustments were (33.6) million and (51.4) million for the third and second quarters of 2024, respectively, a decreased loss of 17.8 million.

 (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

 Year Over Year: Net fair value adjustments were (33.6) million and (41.4) million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decreased loss of 7.8 million. 
 
 Nine Months Over Nine Months : Net fair value adjustments were (129.7) million and (80.2) million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increased loss of 49.5 million. 
 
 The changes in net fair value adjustments were primarily driven by the increase or decrease in the origination volume of marketplace loans. In addition, the decreased losses sequentially and year over year were attributable to higher loan sales prices, resulting from lower interest rates and increased investor demand. 
 
 Net fair value adjustments primarily consist of fair value adjustments on our loans HFS portfolio. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 7. Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of loans HFS and activity within the loans HFS portfolio.

 The allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) for lifetime expected losses under CECL on HFI loans and leases at amortized cost is initially recognized as Provision for credit losses at the time of origination. The ALLL is estimated using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, where effective interest rates are used to calculate the NPV of expected cash flows. The effective interest rates are calculated based on the periodic interest income received from the loan s contractual cash flows and the net investment in the loan, which includes deferred origination fees and costs, to provide a constant rate of return over the loan term. The NPV from the DCF approach is then compared to the amortized cost basis of the loans and leases to derive expected credit losses. Under the DCF approach, the provision for credit losses in subsequent periods includes a credit loss expense related to the discounting effect due to the passage of time after the initial recognition of ALLL on originated HFI loans at amortized cost. 
 
 The provision for credit losses includes the credit loss expense for HFI loans and leases at amortized cost, available for sale (AFS) securities and unfunded lending commitments. The table below illustrates the composition of the provision for credit losses for each period presented, as well as the loan originations held for investment in each period, which is a key driver for credit loss expense: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 2024 2023 Credit loss expense for loans and leases held for investment 47,460 36,577 64,127 113,283 201,167 Credit loss expense (benefit) for securities available for sale

 Sequential: The provision for credit losses was 47.5 million and 35.6 million for the third and second quarters of 2024, respectively, an increase of 34 . The increase was primarily driven by an increase in initial provision from a higher volume of originated loans retained as HFI at amortized cost, partially offset by the impact of a 5.3 million provision in our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio due to one office loan, which was recognized in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding this one office loan, the CRE office loan portfolio balance was under 35 million as of September 30, 2024. The majority of office loans were originated prior to the Acquisition. 
 
 Year Over Year: The provision for credit losses was 47.5 million and 64.5 million for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 26 . The decrease was primarily driven by a higher quantitative and qualitative allowance in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in expected losses and a less favorable economic outlook, partially offset by an increase in the initial provision for credit losses from a higher volume of originated loans retained as HFI at amortized cost. 
 
 Nine Months Over Nine Months: The provision for credit losses was 115.0 million and 201.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 43 . The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the initial provision for credit losses from a lower volume of originated loans retained as HFI at amortized cost.

Income Taxes 
 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recorded an income tax expense of 3.6 million and 12.3 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 19.7 and 22.9 , respectively. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of 3.3 million and 12.1 million, respectively, representing an effective tax rate of 39.9 and 29.7 , respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the favorable impact of recurring items such as tax credits, the unfavorable impact of the non-deductible portions of executive compensation, and the net discrete impact of stock-based compensation. The decrease in effective tax rates for the 2024 periods compared to the same periods in 2023 is primarily due to the net discrete impact of stock-based compensation. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we maintained a valuation allowance of 46.4 million related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and state tax credit carryforwards. The realization and timing of any remaining state NOLs and state tax credit carryforwards is uncertain and may expire before being utilized, based primarily on the allocation of taxable income constraints to the Parent and not related to the earnings of the Company. Changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as current period income tax expense or benefit.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement our financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Pre-Provision Net Revenue (PPNR) and Tangible Book Value (TBV) Per Common Share. Our non-GAAP financial measures do have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP. 
 
 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies. 
 
 We believe PPNR is an important measure because it reflects the underlying financial performance of our business operations. PPNR is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting the provision for credit losses and income tax benefit/expense from net income. 
 
 We believe TBV Per Common Share is an important measure used to evaluate the Company s use of equity. TBV Per Common Share is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the book value of common equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets, divided by ending number of common shares issued and outstanding.

Supervision and Regulatory Environment 
 
 We are subject to periodic exams, investigations, inquiries or requests, enforcement actions and other proceedings from federal and state regulatory and/or law enforcement agencies, including the federal banking regulators that directly regulate the Company and/or LC Bank. Further, we are subject to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and lawsuits alleging regulatory violations. Although historically the Company has generally resolved

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

 these matters in a manner that was not materially adverse to its financial results or business operations, no assurance can be given as to the timing, outcome or consequences of any of these matters in the future. 
 
 We are subject to supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by multiple federal banking regulatory bodies. Specifically, as a bank holding company, the Company is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Further, as a national bank, LC Bank is subject to ongoing and comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Accordingly, we have been and continue to invest in regulatory compliance and be subject to certain parameters, obligations and/or limitations set forth by the banking regulations and regulators with respect to the operation of our business. 
 
 If we are found to not have complied with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, we could: (i) lose one or more of our licenses or authorizations, or be required to obtain a new license or authorization, (ii) become subject to a consent order or administrative enforcement action, (iii) face lawsuits (including class action lawsuits), sanctions, penalties, or other monetary losses due to judgments, orders, or settlements, (iv) be in breach of certain contracts, which may void or cancel such contracts, (v) decide or be compelled to modify or suspend certain of our business practices and/or (vi) be unable to execute on certain Company initiatives, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to operate and/or evolve our lending marketplace and other products and/or services; any of which may harm our business or financial results. 
 
 See Part I Item 1. Business Regulation and Supervision, Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Regulation, Supervision and Compliance, and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Operating Our Business in our Annual Report for further discussion regarding our supervision and regulatory environment. 

Capital Management 
 
 The prudent management of capital is fundamental to the successful achievement of our business initiatives. We actively review capital through a process that continuously assesses and monitors the Company s overall capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. 
 
 The formation of LC Bank as a nationally chartered association and the organization of the Company as a bank holding company subjects us to various capital adequacy guidelines issued by the OCC and the FRB, including the requirement to maintain regulatory capital ratios in accordance with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision standardized approach for U.S. banking organizations (Basel III). As a Basel III standardized approach institution, we selected the one-time election to opt-out of the requirements to include all the components of accumulated other comprehensive income included in common stockholder s equity. The minimum capital requirements under the Basel III capital framework are: a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 , a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0 . Additionally, a Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) of 2.5 must be maintained above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments. In addition to these guidelines, the banking regulators may require a banking organization to maintain capital at levels higher than the minimum ratios prescribed under the Basel III capital framework. See Part I Item 1. Business Regulation and Supervision Capital and Liquidity Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action in our Annual Report and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 19. Regulatory Requirements in this Report for additional information.

 (1) Consists of common stockholders equity as defined under U.S. GAAP and certain adjustments made in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines, including the addition of the CECL transitional benefit and deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets. 
 
 The higher risk-based capital ratios for the Company reflect generally lower risk-weights for assets held by LendingClub Corporation as compared with LC Bank. 
 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB, OCC, and FDIC adopted a final rule related to the regulatory capital treatment of the allowance for credit losses under CECL. As permitted by the rule, the Company elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital resulting in a capital benefit of 35 million at December 31, 2021. This benefit is phased out over a three-year transition period that commenced on January 1, 2022 at a rate of 25 each year through January 1, 2025. 

Liquidity 
 
 We manage liquidity to meet our cash flow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost. We must maintain operating liquidity to meet our expected daily and forecasted cash flow requirements, as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected funding requirements. 
 
 As our primary business at LC Bank involves taking deposits and originating loans, a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans. Liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary.

 LendingClub Bank Liquidity 
 
 The following table summarizes LC Bank s primary sources of short-term liquidity as of the periods presented: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 989,612 1,230,206 Securities available for sale (1) 
 388,679 370,466 Deposits 9,532,342 7,426,445 Available borrowing capacity: FRB Discount Window borrowing capacity 
 2,942,472 2,816,501 FHLB of Des Moines borrowing capacity (2) 
 663,439 661,337 Total available borrowing capacity 3,605,911 3,477,838 
 (1) Excludes illiquid securities available for sale. 
 (2) Includes both loans and securities available for sale pledged as collateral. 
 
 The primary uses of LC Bank liquidity include the funding/acquisition of loans and securities purchases; withdrawals, maturities and the payment of interest on deposits; compensation and benefits expense; taxes; capital expenditures, including internally developed software, leasehold improvements and computer equipment; and costs associated with the continued development and support of our online lending marketplace platform. 
 
 Net capital expenditures were 37.1 million, or 6.8 of total net revenue, and 48.2 million, or 7.4 of total net revenue, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be approximately 60 million, primarily related to costs associated with the continued development and support of our online lending marketplace platform. 
 
 LendingClub Holding Company Liquidity 
 
 The primary source of liquidity at the holding company is 90.0 million and 110.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, the holding company has the ability to access the capital markets through additional registrations and public equity offerings. 
 
 Uses of cash at the holding company include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, such as interest and expenses (including those associated with our office leases), the needs of LC Bank for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing and support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary. 
 
 Factors Impacting Liquidity 
 
 The Company s liquidity could be adversely impacted by deteriorating financial and market conditions, the inability or unwillingness of a creditor to provide funding, an idiosyncratic event (e.g., a major loss, causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition), an adverse systemic event (e.g., default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant), or others. 
 
 We believe, based on our projections, that our cash on hand, liquid AFS securities, available borrowing capacity, and net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months, as well as beyond the next twelve months. See Item 1. Financial Statements Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for additional detail regarding our cash flows.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

 Market Risk 
 
 Market risk represents the risk of potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and/or other relevant market rates or prices. The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from financial instruments including loans, securities and borrowings, all entered into for purposes other than trading. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 LendingClub Bank 
 
 Our net interest income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, and the level and composition of deposits and liabilities, among other factors. 
 
 Loans HFI at LC Bank are funded primarily through our deposit base. The majority of loans HFI are fixed-rate instruments over the term of the loans. As a result, the primary component of interest rate risk on our financial instruments at LC Bank arises from the impact of fluctuations in loan and deposit rates on our net interest income. Therefore, we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our net interest income results. The outcome of the analysis is influenced by a variety of assumptions, including the maturity profile and prepayment level of our unsecured consumer loans and expected consumer responses to changes in rates paid on non-maturity deposit products. Our assumptions are periodically calibrated to observed data and/or expected outcomes. We actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and have entered into interest rate hedging instruments, some of which qualify for hedge accounting treatment, to manage such risk. See Note 8. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information. 
 
 The following table presents the change in projected net interest income for the next twelve months due to a hypothetical instantaneous parallel change in interest rates relative to current rates: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates: + 200 basis points (6.6) (4.8) + 100 basis points (3.2) (2.2) 100 basis points 1.2 200 basis points 1.9 (0.4) 
 
 As illustrated in the table above, net interest income is projected to decrease over the next twelve months during hypothetical rising interest rate environments primarily as a result of higher rates paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by higher rates earned on new loans, investment purchases, and cash and cash equivalents as well as by the impact of our hedging activity. Conversely, net interest income is projected to increase over the next twelve months during hypothetical declining interest rate environments. The increase in sensitivity as of September 30, 2024 relative to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the composition of our loans, deposits and hedging instruments and assumes no replacement of maturing interest rate hedges. Furthermore, during fluctuating interest rate environments, the increased sensitivity of repricing interest-bearing deposits is more impactful than that of repricing fixed-rate loans. 
 
 Although we believe that these measurements provide an estimate of our interest rate sensitivity, they do not account for potential changes in credit quality, balance sheet mix, size of our balance sheet, or other business developments that could affect net income. Actual results could differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations.

 For the contractual maturities and weighted-average yields on the Company s AFS securities portfolio, see Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Securities Available for Sale. 
 
 LendingClub Holding Company 
 
 At the holding company level, we continue to measure interest rate sensitivity by evaluating the change in fair value of certain assets and liabilities due to a hypothetical change in interest rates. Principal payments on our loans HFI continue to reduce the outstanding balance of this portfolio, and, as a result, the fair value impact from changes in interest rates continues to diminish.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating its disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, of achieving the desired control objectives, and is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Based on the evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were designed and functioned effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the third quarter of 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The risks described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. While we believe the risks and uncertainties described therein include all material risks currently known by us, it is possible that these may not be the only ones we face.
