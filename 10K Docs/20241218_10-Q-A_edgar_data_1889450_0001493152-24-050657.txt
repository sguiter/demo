the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Units was placed in a trust account Trust Account which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company
that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the
Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account to the Company s

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward
consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that
together have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting
commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing of a definitive agreement to enter
a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires
 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company
will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.

Note
1 - Description of Organization and Business Operations, Going Concern and Basis of Presentation (Continued) 

The
Company has until November 18, 2023 (or up to February 18, 2024, if extended) to consummate a Business Combination (the Combination
Period ). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period, the Company will (i)
cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust
Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes
(less up to of
interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s
remaining stockholders and its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the
Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly,
it is the Company s intention to redeem its Public Shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the Combination Period.
As such, the Company s stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them
(but no more) and any liability of such stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality
or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 
per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account,
if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will
not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in
the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of
the underwriter of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations,
nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe
that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its stockholders that the Sponsor
would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by
third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the
possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors,
service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the
Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Use of Funds Restricted for Payment of Taxes 

In 2024, in connection with redemptions that occurred
in August 2023, the Company determined it did not withdraw all the interest from the trust account that it was allowed to withdraw to
cover federal income and State of Delaware franchise taxes which had accrued and, therefore, the redemption payment should have been adjusted
down to per share. As a result, the redeeming stockholders were overpaid in the amount of . The Company has initiated
recovery efforts from the redeeming stockholders through Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company CST ). Redeeming
Stockholders have been notified of this situation and are being instructed to return the Overpayment Amount to CST. The Sponsor is responsible
for the shortfall, if any, between the overpayment amount of , which is included in Due from Sponsor amount on the Company s
condensed balance sheet, and the actual amount recovered from Redeeming Stockholders. 

Liquidity
and Management s Plans 

At
September 30, 2023, the Company had cash of 
and working capital deficit of . 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of and working capital deficit of . 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard
Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until November 18, 2023 (or up to February 18, 2024, if extended) to
complete a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate an initial Business Combination by this
time. If an initial Business Combination is not consummated by this date and the Company has not exercised its option to extend the
deadline, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. These factors, among others, raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the Company s inability to continue as a going concern.

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Management is currently evaluating the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s
financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of
the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Additionally, as a result of the military action that
commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company s
ability to consummate a Business Combination or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business
Combination may be materially and adversely affected. Further, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent
on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility,
or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this
action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations
and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to
file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares

contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Some of the statements in this Quarterly
Report constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or future financial condition.
These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about
our company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding our or our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future. In addition,
any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying
assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, 
 estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, 
 potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions
may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report may include, for example, statements about: 

our
 ability to select an appropriate target business or businesses; 

our
 ability to complete our initial business combination; 

our
 expectations around the performance of the prospective target business or businesses; 

our
 success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business
 combination; 

our
 officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or
 in approving our initial business combination; 

our
 potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

our
 pool of prospective target businesses; 

the
 ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our
 disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and any material weaknesses of the foregoing; 

the
 use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; 

the
 trust account not being subject to claims of third parties; or 

our
 financial performance. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated.
These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions
that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the section of this Quarterly Report entitled
 Risk Factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be
required under applicable securities laws.

We
use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, seeks, 
 plans, estimates, targets and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. The
forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially
from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason. 

Although
we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove
to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these
and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded
as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on August 19, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital
stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business
Combination ). We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth
companies. We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale
of the Private Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans
to raise capital or to complete our initial Business Combination will be successful.

shall have occurred, provided that FutureTech II Partners LLC (the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees)
will deposit into a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the Trust Account the lesser
of: (i) 125,000 and (ii) an aggregate amount equal to 0.04 multiplied by the number of our public shares that are not redeemed for
each such one-month extension unless the closing of our initial business combination shall have occurred, in exchange for a non-interest
bearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon consummation of a business combination. 

As
approved by its stockholders at the Special Meeting, we filed an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the
 Charter with the Delaware Secretary of State on August 17, 2023 (the Charter Amendment ), to extend the date
by which we have to consummate a business combination for an additional six months, from August 18, 2023 (the Termination Date to up to February 18, 2024, by electing to extend the date to consummate an initial business combination on a monthly basis for up to
six times by an additional one month each time after the Termination Date, until February 18, 2024 or a total of up to six months after
the Termination Date, or such earlier date as determined by the Board, unless the closing of our initial business combination shall have
occurred (the Extension, and such later date, the Extended Date ), provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates
or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account the lesser of: (i) 125,000 and (ii) an aggregate amount equal to 0.04 multiplied
by the number of our public shares that are not redeemed for each such one-month extension unless the closing of our initial business
combination shall have occurred, in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon consummation of a business
combination. 

In
connection with the votes to approve the Extension, the holders of 5,943,650 public shares of our Class A common stock properly exercised
their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.81 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount
of approximately 64.2 million. 

On February 17,
2023 the Company caused to be deposited 1,150,000 into the Company s Trust Account for its public stockholders, representing
 0.10 per public share, allowing the Company to extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial Business Combination by
three months from February 18, 2023 to May 18, 2023. On May 17, 2023 the Company caused to be deposited 1,150,000 into the
Company s Trust Account for its public stockholders, representing 0.10 per public share, allowing the Company to extend the
period of time it has to consummate its initial Business Combination by three months from May 18, 2023 to August 18, 2023. On August

Use of Funds Restricted for Payment of Taxes 

In 2024, in connection with redemptions that occurred
in August 2023, the Company determined it did not withdraw all the interest from the trust account that it was allowed to withdraw to
cover federal income and State of Delaware franchise taxes which had accrued and, therefore, the redemption payment should have been adjusted
down to 10.74 per share. As a result, the redeeming stockholders were overpaid in the amount of 447,229. The Company has initiated
recovery efforts from the redeeming stockholders through Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company CST ). Redeeming
Stockholders have been notified of this situation and are being instructed to return the Overpayment Amount to CST. The Sponsor is responsible
for the shortfall, if any, between the overpayment amount of 447,229, which is included in Due from Sponsor amount on the Company s
condensed balance sheet, and the actual amount recovered from Redeeming Stockholders.

have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from inception to September 30, 2023 were
organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering Initial Public Offering ), conducting
the Initial Public Offering and identifying a target company for a business combination. The Company will not generate any operating
revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income
in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering We incur expenses
as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence
expenses. 

For
the three months September 30, 2023, we had net income of 661,226, which consisted of investment income of 1,232,507, partially offset
by expenses of 329,255 and tax expense of 242,027. Investment income was higher in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the increase in interest
rates. Expenses were higher in 2023 compared to 2022 due to due diligence costs related to a potential business combination transaction. 

For
the three months ending September 30, 2022, we had net income of 391,997 which consisted of administrative support costs of 30,000,
formation and operating costs of 85,711 and franchise tax cost of 50,000 which were offset by interest earned on investments held in
the Trust Account of 557,708. 

For
the nine months September 30, 2023, we had net income of 2,304,898, which consisted of investment income of 3,989,390, partially offset
by expenses of 890,821 and tax expense of 793,671. Investment income was higher in 2023 compared to 2022 due to the increase in interest
rates. Expenses were higher in 2023 compared to 2022 due to due diligence costs related to a potential business combination transaction. 

For
the nine months September 30, 2022, we had net income of 194,381 which consisted of administrative support costs of 40,000, formation
and operating costs of 331,850 and franchise tax cost of 148,767 which were offset by interest earned on investments held in the Trust
Account of 674,998. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard
Board s Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until November 18, 2023 to complete a Business Combination. It is
uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate an initial Business Combination by this time. If an initial Business
Combination is not consummated by this date and the Company has not exercised its option to extend the deadline, there will be a
mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the Company s inability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company had 5,496 in cash and no cash equivalents as of September
30, 2023. 

21 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2023. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as
variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. The underwriter is entitled
to a deferred fee of three percent (3.00 of the gross proceeds of the Offering upon closing of the Business Combination, or 3,450,000.
The deferred fee will be paid in cash upon the closing of a Business Combination from the amounts held in the Trust Account, subject
to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of audited financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the audited financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods
reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2023, the below were the critical accounting
policies. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited
condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

Making
estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of
a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, which management
considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual
results could differ significantly from those estimates. 

Class
A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption 

The
Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480 Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity . Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured
at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the
control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control)
is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. The Company s
Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company s control
and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Class A common
stock subject to possible redemption in the amount of 60,020,387 and 118,466,326, respectively, is presented as temporary equity, outside
of the stockholders equity section of the Company s condensed balance sheets. The decrease of 61,701,177 and 58,445,939
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, in the Class A common stock subject to possible redemption is
due to a redemption during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and remeasurement adjustments during the three and nine months ended
of 2,090,482 and 5,345,720, respectively. There were remeasurement adjustments of 526,231 during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022, respectively. 

22 

Net
Income (Loss) Per Share 

Net
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Earnings and losses are shared pro rata
between the two classes of shares. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share of common stock does not consider the effect of
the warrants issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering and (ii) sale of the Private Placement Units, because the warrants
are contingently exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share is the same as
basic income (loss) per share for the periods presented. 

The
following table reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in dollars, except per share amounts):

Recent
Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options
(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to
simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial
conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining
to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible
debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings
per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption
permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our audited financial statements. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
of September 30, 2023, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering,
the net proceeds received into the Trust Accounts, have been invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity
of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in US treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments,
we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and
chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of
September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting
that existed relating to financial reporting systems and the error in determining the redemption price for the redeeming shareholders in August 2023. 

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

23 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the material weakness described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by
this Item. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks

or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or
that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our final prospectus dated February 14, 2022 filed with the
SEC, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 25, 2022, our Quarterly
