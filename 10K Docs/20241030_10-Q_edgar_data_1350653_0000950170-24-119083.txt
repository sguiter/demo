of the Company s total revenue. In certain cases, the Company does offer the ability for customers to lease its imaging equipment, but such arrangements are immaterial to total revenue in the periods presented. The Company generally does not allow returns of products that have been delivered. Costs incurred by the Company associated directly with sales contracts with customers are deferred over the performance obligation period and recognized in the same period as the related revenue, except for contracts that complete within one year or less, in which case the associated costs are expensed as incurred. Payment terms for sales to customers may vary but are commensurate with the general business practices in the country of sale. To the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates, and customer payment penalties, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company's judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company s anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available, including historical, current, and forecasted information. The Company records a contract asset when one or more performance obligations have been completed by the Company and revenue has been recognized, but the customer's payment is contingent on the satisfaction of additional performance obligations. Contract assets are generally short-term in nature. The Company records a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when it has an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received in advance of its performance. These amounts primarily relate to undelivered equipment and related services, or maintenance agreements. When the Company sells a product or service

In conjunction with obtaining the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred million in debt issuance costs. These costs were capitalized to other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, associated with the Revolving Credit Fac ility were million.

The 2026 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for a specified period of time. In addition, calling any of the 2026 Notes for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to the redeemable note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of the redeemed note will be increased in certain circumstances if such note is converted after it is called for redemption. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. principal payments are otherwise due on the 2026 Notes prior to maturity.

Purchase Commitments The Company is obligated to meet certain minimum purchase commitment requirements with a third-party supplier through December 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining minimum purchase commitment required by the Company under the agreement is million. Litigation The Company is and may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from its business activities. While management is not aware of any litigation matter that in and of itself would have a material adverse impact on the Company s condensed consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and depending on the nature and timing of a proceeding, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect the Company s future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period. The Company assesses contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual or disclosure in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating contingencies, the Company may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against the Company may be unsupported, exaggerated or unrelated to reasonably possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the Company s potential liability.

 Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). In addition to historical information, the following management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations includes forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, such as those set forth under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and any updates to those risk factors filed from time to time in our subsequent periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. 
 Overview 
 We are a medical technology company, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for better surgical treatment of spine disorders. By applying our unique, 100 spine focus and deep, collective industry know-how, we aim to revolutionize the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. The sophisticated approaches that we create from the ground up are designed to integrate with our expanding Alpha InformatiX product platform to objectively inform surgery and achieve the goals of spine surgery more predictably and more reproducibly. We have a comprehensive product portfolio designed to address the spine s various pathologies, and are perpetually innovating to accomplish our ultimate vision, which is to be the standard bearer in spine. 
 The application of our team s deep spine know-how, coupled with a willingness to invest holistically in the technologies integrated into our procedural approaches continues to increasingly compel surgeons and sales talent to partner with us. That adoption-driven validation has been the source of industry-leading market share expansion, which has delivered an approximately 40 revenue compound annual growth rate since our transformation commenced in 2018. 
 We market and sell our products through a network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives. To deliver consistent, predictable growth, we have added, and intend to continue to add, clinically astute and exclusive sales team members to reach untapped surgeons, hospitals, and national accounts and better penetrate existing accounts and territories. 
 Revenue and Expense Components 
 The following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses: 
 Revenue. We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of spinal surgery implants used in the treatment of spine disorders as well as the sale of medical imaging equipment which is used for surgical planning and post-operative assessment. Spinal implant products include pedicle screws and complementary implants, interbody devices, plates, and tissue-based materials. Medical imaging equipment includes our EOS full-body and weight-bearing x-ray imaging devices, and related services. Our revenue is generated by our direct sales force and independent sales agents. Our products are shipped and invoiced to hospitals and surgical centers. Currently, most of our business is conducted with customers within markets in which we have experience and with payment terms that are customary to our business. We may defer revenue until the time of collection if circumstances related to payment terms, regional market risk or customer history indicate that collectability is not certain. 
 Cost of sales . Cost of sales consists primarily of direct product costs, royalties, service labor hours, and parts. Our product costs consist primarily of raw materials, component parts, direct labor, and overhead. The product costs of certain of our biologics products include the cost of procuring and processing human tissue. We incur royalties related to the technologies that we license from others and the products that are developed in part by surgeons with whom we collaborate in the product development process. 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 Research and development expenses . Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our products. Research and development expenses also include salaries and related employee benefits, research-related overhead expenses, and fees paid to external service providers and development consultants in the form of both cash and equity. 
 Sales, general and administrative expenses . Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits, sales commissions and other variable costs, depreciation of our surgical instruments, regulatory affairs, quality assurance costs, professional service fees, travel, medical education, trade show and marketing costs, and insurance expenses. 
 Litigation-related expenses. Litigation-related expenses consist of costs incurred for our ongoing and settled litigation. 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. 
 Transaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses consist of one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These items may include but are not limited to consulting and legal fees, and other related deal costs. 
 Restructuring expenses . Restructuring expenses are primarily associated with the realignment of our operations and geographical footprint to achieve synergies, in which we incur one-time costs related to exiting and/or relocating our facilities, and personnel related expenses including severance and other costs. 
 Total interest expense and other expense, net . Total interest expense and other expense, net includes interest income, interest expense, gains and losses from foreign currency exchanges and other non-operating gains and losses. 
 Income tax provision. Income tax provision primarily consists of an estimate of federal, state, and foreign income taxes based on enacted state and foreign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for accounts receivable, inventories, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumption conditions. 
 Critical accounting policies are those that, in management s view, are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. Management believes there have been no material changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to the critical accounting policies discussed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC.

Cost of sales increased 9.8 million, or 26 , and 2.8 million, or 2 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in product volume offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. We have entered into Development Service Agreements for the development of a wide variety of potential products and intellectual property. Under these agreements, future royalty payments for product and/or intellectual property rights may be paid in either cash or restricted shares of our common stock at the election of the developer, depending on the terms of the agreement. Certain of these agreements were amended to remove the cash royalty option and require settlement in restricted shares of our common stock. Stock-based compensation associated with these awards was higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 than the other periods presented as the vesting conditions of certain of these amended awards were deemed probable at that time.

Research and development expenses . Research and development expenses increased 0.4 million, or 2 , and 9.6 million, or 20 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation related to our Development Service Agreements and due to an increase in personnel to support the expansion of our new product portfolio. 
 
 Sales, general and administrative expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 17.8 million, or 19 , and 65.7 million, or 24 , during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs and variable selling expenses associated with the increase in revenue, and our continued investment in building our strategic distribution channel. Additionally, we continued to increase our investment in our sales and marketing functions by increasing headcount to support the growth of our business, as well as necessary administrative support. 
 Litigation-related expenses. Litigation expenses decreased 0.6 million, or 23 , and 4.2 million, or 33 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily related to resolved litigation matters. 
 Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense increased 1.1 million, or 10 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, our Revolving Credit Facility and cash from operations. On October 29, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment of the Braidwell Term Loan, which provides for an additional term loan of 50.0 million. Our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, investments in inventory and instrument sets to support our customers, as well as other operating costs. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales, marketing and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, and the international expansions of our business. 
 As current borrowing sources become due, we may be required to access the capital markets for additional funding. If we are required to access the debt markets, we expect to be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of spending and cash use as well as our ability to secure additional credit facilities, term loans, or other similar arrangements in light of our spending levels and general financial market conditions. 
 A substantial portion of our operations are in the United States ("U.S."), and most of our net sales have been made in the U.S. Accordingly, we do not have material exposures to foreign currency rate fluctuations from operations. However, as our business in markets outside of the U.S. continues to increase, we will be exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 We do not have any material financial exposure to one customer or one country, outside of the United States, that would significantly hinder our liquidity. We are and may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from our business activities. While we have no material, undisclosed accruals for pending litigation or claims, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and depending on the nature and timing of a proceeding, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period. We assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual or disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our condensed consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events because litigation is inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable resolutions could occur. When evaluating contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to reasonably possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of our potential liability. We have disclosed all material accruals for pending litigation or investigations in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Cash and cash equivalents were 81.0 million and 221.0 million at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe that our existing funds, cash generated from our operations and our existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue.
