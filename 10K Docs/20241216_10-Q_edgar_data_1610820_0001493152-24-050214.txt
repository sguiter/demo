and negative cash flows from operating activities during the three-month period ended October 31, 2024 was .
 The Company is planning to finance its operations by exploring additional sources of capital and financing, while managing its
 existing working capital resources. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to
 attain future profitable operations and to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations arising from normal business
 operations when they come due. The uncertainty of the Company s ability to raise such financial capital casts substantial
 doubt on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any
 adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to
 continue as a going concern. See note 5(b) for details of an 
 million gross and 
 million gross offering that was completed in September 2024 and October 2024, respectively. 

e.
 
 The
 Company has two wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries: (i) BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. BTC ), which was incorporated in April
 3, 2014, under the laws of the state of Delaware, and (ii) BTC has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapientia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Sapientia ),
 which was incorporated in September 20, 2012, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company also has one Canadian subsidiary:
 BriaPro Therapeutics Corp, BriaPro which was incorporated on May 15, 2023, under the Business Corporations Act (British
 Columbia). See also note 1f. (Sapientia and BTC and BriaPro together, the Subsidiaries ). 

f. 
 On August 31, 2023, the Company closed a plan of arrangement spinout transaction
(the Arrangement pursuant to which certain pipeline assets of the Company, including Bria-TILsRx and protein kinase
C delta (PKC inhibitors for multiple indications including cancer (the BriaPro Assets ), were spun-out to BriaPro
Therapeutics Corp. BriaPro ), resulting in a 2/3rd owned subsidiary of the Company with the remaining 1/3rd held by BriaCell
shareholders BriaCell Shareholders ). 

Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement,
BriaPro has acquired the entire right and interest in and to the BriaPro Assets in consideration for the issuance by BriaPro to the Company
of BriaPro common shares. Under the terms of the Arrangement, for each BriaCell share held immediately prior to closing, BriaCell Shareholders
receive one (1) common share of BriaPro, and one (1) new common share of BriaCell (retiring their old share) having the same terms and
characteristics as the existing BriaCell common shares. The Company will remain listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market and Toronto Stock Exchange,
and BriaPro is an unlisted reporting issuer in Canada. 

Immediately following the closing of the
Arrangement, the Company controls 2/3rd of the BriaPro common shares representing approximately of the issued and outstanding common
shares of BriaPro. 

As a result of the Arrangement, there are
 BriaPro common shares issued and outstanding. The Company now beneficially owns or controls approximately BriaPro
common shares, representing 2/3rd of the issued and outstanding BriaPro common shares. 

Pursuant to the Arrangement, each BriaCell
warrant in issuance at the time of the Arrangement shall, in accordance with its terms, entitle the holder thereof to receive, upon the
exercise thereof, one BriaCell Share and one BriaPro Share for the original exercise price. Warrants issued by the Company, subsequent
to the Arrangement are not subject to the terms above. 

Upon the exercise of BriaCell Warrants,
BriaCell shall, as agent for BriaPro, collect and pay to BriaPro an amount for each one (1) BriaPro Share so issued that is equal to the
exercise price under the BriaCell Warrant multiplied by the fair market value of one (1) BriaPro Share at the Effective Date divided by
the total fair market value of one (1) BriaCell Share and one (1) BriaPro Share at the Effective Date BriaPro Warrant Shares ). 

Pursuant to the Arrangement, all Briacell
option holders received the same amount of BriaPro options BriaPro Option and under the BriaPro incentive plan. The exercise
price of the BriaCell options was apportioned between the BriaCell options and the BriaPro options, as follows: 

Each one (1) BriaPro Option to acquire one
(1) Share shall have an exercise price equal to the product obtained by multiplying the original exercise price of the BriaCell Option
by the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the fair market value of a BriaPro Share at the Effective Date by (B) the aggregate fair market
value of a BriaCell Share and a BriaPro Share at the Effective Date. 

Pursuant to the Arrangement, all BriaCell
Restricted Shares Units RSU holders received the same amount of BriaPro RSU s under the BriaPro incentive plan. 

Transition Services Agreement 

On August 31, 2023, the Company and BriaPro
executed a transition services agreement (the Agreement ), pursuant to which BriaCell will provide certain research and development
and head office services (the Services to BriaPro for a fixed monthly fee of . 

Briacell and BriaPro acknowledged the transitional
nature of the Services and accordingly, as promptly as practicable, BriaPro agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to transition
each Service to its own internal organization or to obtain alternate third party providers to provide the Services. 

In accordance with US GAAP s Accounting Standards Codification 505
 Equity , the Arrangement was determined to be a spinoff of nonmonetary assets which did not constitute a business. However,
since the assets were transferred to an entity under the Company s control, the assets is being recorded on the Company s
basis (carry value) and not at fair market value.

Overview 

BriaCell is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that is developing novel immunotherapies to transform cancer care.
Immunotherapies have come to the forefront in the fight against cancer as they harness the body s own immune system to recognize
and destroy cancer cells. The Company is currently advancing its Bria-IMT targeted immunotherapy in combination with an immune
check point inhibitor (Retifanlimab) in a pivotal Phase 3 study in metastatic breast cancer. Bria-IMT is currently under Fast Track
Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(the FDA intended to accelerate the review process of novel treatments
that address unmet medical needs. Positive completion of the pivotal study, following review by FDA, could lead to full approval of the
Bria-IMT immune checkpoint inhibitor combination in metastatic breast cancer. BriaCell reported benchmark-beating patient survival
and clinical benefit in metastatic breast cancer with median overall survival of 13.4 months in BriaCell s metastatic breast cancer
patients vs. 6.7-9.8 months for similar patients reported in the literature in its Phase 2 study of Bria-IMT combination study
with retifanlimab at the 2023 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. A completed Bria-IMT Phase 1 combination study with retifanlimab
(an anti-PD1 antibody manufactured by Incyte) confirmed tolerability and early-stage efficacy. BriaCell is also developing personalized
off-the-shelf immunotherapies, Bria-OTS and Bria-OTS+ , which provides a platform technology to develop personalized off-the-shelf
immunotherapies for numerous types of cancer, and a soluble CD80 protein therapeutic which acts both as a stimulator of the immune system
as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

Recent
Developments 

On
October 15, 2024, the Company provided an update on its pivotal Phase 3 study in metastatic breast cancer - 35 clinical sites (18 main
and 17 satellite) are active and enrolling patients. Additional sites are in various stages of start-up. Interim data will be analyzed
once 144 events (deaths) occur, comparing the overall survival (OS) in patients treated with the Bria-IMT combination regimen
versus those treated with physician s choice as the primary endpoint. Positive results of the pivotal Phase 3 study could result
in full approval and marketing authorization for Bria-IMT in MBC patients. Secondary analyses include comparison of the Bria-IMT 
combination regimen vs Bria-IMT monotherapy. BriaCell recently announced impressive Phase 2 survival data in a similar MBC patient
population. The Bria-IMT combination regimen has received FDA Fast Track designation. 

On
October 22, 2024, the Company reported that in the Company s Phase 2 clinical study, patients treated with the same Bria-IMT 
regimen formulation being used in the ongoing Phase 3 pivotal trial experienced a one-year survival rate of 55 (i.e. 55 of patients
remain alive at least one year after starting on the study). This rate exceeds the survival data of the current standard of care for
similar patients (see Table 1). Notably, 4 of 13 patients recruited in 2022 remain in survival follow-up as well. 

On
November, 21, 2024, the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in its Phase 1/2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06471673)
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Bria-OTS , BriaCell s personalized next generation immunotherapy. The study will investigate
Bria-OTS alone and in combination with immune check point inhibitor tislelizumab (manufactured and supplied by BeiGene, Ltd.)
for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Bria-OTS is an enhanced form of Bria-IMT , currently in pivotal Phase 3 study
for metastatic breast cancer. 

On
November 23, 2024, Marc Lustig resigned from the board of directors of the Company. 

On
December 13, 2024, the Company closed a public offering for the purchase and sale of 7,400,000 common shares of the Company and warrants
to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,400,000 common shares of the Company for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 5.55 million
before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses (the December 2024 Offering ). Each common
share was sold together with one warrant to purchase one common share at a combined purchase price of 0.75. The warrants have an exercise
price of 0.9375 per share, and are immediately exercisable for a period of five years from the closing date. In addition, the Company
issued 370,000 agent warrants. The agent warrants are immediately exercisable for a period of five years from the closing date at an
exercise price of 0.9375.

Research
and Development Costs 

Research
costs are comprised primarily of (i) salaries and wages to Company employees at our laboratory and (ii) clinical trials and investigational
drug costs, which include the testing and manufacture of our investigational drugs and costs of our clinical trials.

3,665,341 
 6,857,257 

For
the three-month period ending October 31, 2024, research costs amounted to 3,665,341, a significant decrease from the 6,857,257 incurred
during the same period in 2023. This reduction was primarily driven by lower clinical trial sites and investigational drug costs, which
decreased from 5,397,438 in 2023 to 2,439,667 in 2024. The decrease reflects the conclusion of the Bria-IMT Phase 1/2a trial
and a focus on optimizing expenditures for the pivotal Phase 3 trial. Wages and salaries decreased slightly, from 1,020,725 in 2023
to 949,089 in 2024, reflecting resource allocation adjustments. Laboratory rent increased to 114,330 in 2024, up from 88,480 in 2023,
due to expanded use of facilities to support ongoing research. Supplies also increased, from 89,023 in 2023 to 99,430 in 2024, driven
by higher operational needs. Depreciation expenses of 22,839 were recognized in 2024, reflecting investments in capital assets to support
research activities. Professional fees increased to 7,268 in 2024, compared to 3,782 in 2023, primarily due to consulting and support
for clinical operations. Notably, share-based compensation expenses decreased significantly, from 257,809 in 2023 to 32,718 in 2024,
contributing to the overall reduction in research and development expenses. 

Our
clinical trial expenses are broken down as follows:

2,439,667 
 3,627,290 

Clinical
trial expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024, were 2,439,667, compared to 3,627,290 during the same period in 2023. The
decrease in expenses is primarily attributable to the conclusion of patient recruitment and related activities in the Bria-IMT 
Phase 1/2a clinical trial in fiscal 2024. This reduction in costs aligns with our transition to the pivotal Phase 3 study of Bria-IMT ,
which has become the primary focus of our clinical development efforts. 

For
the three-month period ending October 31, 2024, Bria-IMT Pivotal Phase 3 Study costs amounted to 2,185,543, remaining consistent
with the prior year s 2,278,258. This consistency reflects our strategic decision to optimize spending while focusing expenditures
on this pivotal trial, underscoring our commitment to prioritizing the Phase 3 study as the cornerstone of our clinical development program.
Resources were effectively allocated toward patient recruitment, trial operations, and preparation for key milestones. 

For
the three-month period ending October 31, 2024, Bria-IMT Phase 1/2a costs amounted to 142,496, a significant decrease compared
to 1,214,440 during the same period in 2023. This decrease is attributed to the trial s conclusion in fiscal 2024, with only minimal
remaining expenses related to final data analysis and study close-out activities. 

For
the three-month period ending October 31, 2024, indirect research and development expenses allocated to trials amounted to 111,628,
compared to 134,592 in the prior year. This reduction is primarily due to streamlined trial operations and a shift in resource allocation
toward the pivotal Phase 3 study. 

We
remain focused on advancing the pivotal Phase 3 study of Bria-IMT in advanced breast cancer and continue to direct resources accordingly
to ensure its timely progression. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

For
the three-month period ending October 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses amounted to 1,487,491, showing a decrease from 1,645,771
in the same period of 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily stems from lower insurance premiums, professional
fees and share-based compensation expenses. The Company has reduced general and administrative expenses in order to devote more resources
to its clinical program. 

Financial
income (expenses), net 

For
the three-month period ending October 31, 2024, net financial income amounted to 11,714, a significant decrease from the 179,822 recorded
in the same period of 2023. Financial income for the three-month period ending October 31, 2024 primarily consists of interest income
of 13,050, offset by a foreign exchange loss of 1,336. In comparison, For the three-month period ending October 31, 2023, interest
income was 190,815, while foreign exchange losses totaled 10,993. The decrease in financial income from 2023 to 2024 reflects lower
interest income due to reduced cash and cash equivalents available for investment in interest-bearing funds 

Profit
(loss) for the period 

For
the three-month period ended October 31, 2024, the Company reported a loss of 5,829,276 compared to a gain of 5,958,872 for the same
period in 2023. The loss in the three-month period ended October 31, 2024, primarily resulted from the significant change in the fair
value of the warrant liability, which accounted for a loss of 616,643 in 2024 compared to a gain of 14,282,078 in 2023. This highlights
the substantial impact that warrant liability valuation has on the Company s overall financial performance, despite decreased operational
spending during the period, particularly in research and development.

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern Uncertainty 

The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The continuing operations of the Company are dependent
upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future. 

As
of October 31, 2024, and a positive working capital balance of 3,230,459 (July 31, 2024 negative balance of 3,807,303). 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Company has total assets of 10,414,330 (July 31, 2024 - 5,872,261), a positive working capital of 3,230,459
(July 31, 2024 negative balance of 3,807,303) and an accumulated deficit of 91,245,872 (July 31, 2024 - 85,443,697). 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Company s capital resources consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, comprising mostly
of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities,
and investment grade corporate debt securities . Our investment policy and strategy are focused
on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. 

Historically,
the Company has financed its operation through private and public placement of equity securities, as well as debt financing. The Company s
ability to fund its longer-term cash requirements is subject to multiple risks, many of which are beyond its control. The Company intends
to raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes
that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so.
There is no assurance that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a
going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail or cease its operations and implement
a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be
no assurance that such a plan will be successful. To this end, for several months during calendar year 2024, certain directors and officers
agreed to defer payment of their directors fees/compensation until we completed a financing, after which, these fees were paid
in full. Further, certain officers have indicated their willingness to receive a portion of their compensation in equity of the Company,
subject to applicable Nasdaq rules. In addition, we continue to reduce expenditure on certain non-core activities whilst maintaining
our focus on our Phase 3 Bria-IMT pivotal study in advanced metastatic breast cancer. 

During
the period ended October 31, 2024, the Company s overall position of cash and cash equivalents increased by 4,930,176 from the
period ended July 31, 2024 (including effects of foreign exchange). This increase in cash can be
attributed to the following: 

The
Company s net cash used in operating activities during the period ended October 31, 2024, was 6,955,076 as compared to 7,605,245
for the period ended October 31, 2023. 

Cash
gained in financing activities for the period ended October 31, 2024, was 11,960,252 as compared to nil for the period ended October
31, 2023.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

New
Accounting Policies Adopted 

The
Company did not adopt any new accounting policies during the period ended October 31, 2024. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments, warrant liability, short term loans, trade payable,
and accrued expenses and other payables. Unless otherwise noted, it is management s opinion that the Company is not exposed to
significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates
their carrying values, unless otherwise noted. 

Management
understands that the Company is exposed to financial risk arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility
of these rates as a portion of the Company s transactions occur in Canadian Dollars (mainly costs relating to being a public company
in Canada), and the Company s functional and presentation currency is the US dollar. The Company does not use derivative instruments
to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. 

The
Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of Directors approves and monitors
the risk management process. The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without
unduly affecting the Company s competitiveness and flexibility. 

The
type of risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed is as follows: 

Credit
risk 

The
Company has no significant concentration of credit risk arising from operations. Management believes that the credit risk concentration
with respect to financial instruments is remote. 

Liquidity
Risk 

The
Company s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities as they come
due. As of October 31, 2024, the Company has total assets of 10,414,330 (July 31, 2024 - 5,872,261) and a positive working capital
balance of 3,230,459 (July 31, 2024 - negative working capital balance of 3,807,303). 

Market
Risk 

Interest
rate risk 

Interest
Rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Loans
payable include both fixed and variable interest rates; however, the Company does not believe it is exposed to material interest rate
risk. 

Price
risk 

As
the Company has no revenues, price risk is remote. 

22 

Exchange
risk 

The
Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk as a portion of the Company s transactions occur in Canadian Dollars (mainly costs
relating to being a public company in Canada) and, therefore, the Company is exposed to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting
period through its Canadian denominated accounts payable and cash. As of October 31, 2024, a 5 depreciation or appreciation of the Canadian
dollar against the US dollar would not have a material effect on the in total loss and comprehensive loss. 

Fair
Values 

The
carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade payable, warrant liability, short term loans, and accrued expenses and other payables
approximate their fair values due to their short terms to maturity. 

Cash
and cash equivalents are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of the warrant liability is determined based
on the nature of the warrant. For publicly traded warrants we use the quoted market price and for all other warrants we use the Black-Scholes
pricing model. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal accounting
and financial officer have concluded that as of October 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level.
