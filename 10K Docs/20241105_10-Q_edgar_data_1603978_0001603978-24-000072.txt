Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial information and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on April 1, 2024. Overview We believe that we are a distinctive brand in land-based aquaculture. As a vertically integrated Company, we have decades of experience in farming Atlantic salmon from broodstock to grow out. We leverage our operational expertise and advances in fish breeding, genetics, and health and nutrition, to deliver innovative solutions that address food insecurity and climate change issues. Our land-based farms utilize recirculating aquaculture systems, which are designed to prevent disease and include multiple levels of fish containment designed to protect wild fish populations. Our primary farming principle is to raise nutritious salmon that is free of antibiotics and located close to key consumption markets, in a manner that is good for the environment, good for the fish and good for consumers. Until 2024, our primary product was our GE Atlantic salmon, which received FDA approval in 2015 as the first genetically engineered animal available for sale for human consumption. Although we commenced commercial activities in 2021 with operations in the United States and Canada, we are not currently growing our GE Atlantic salmon for sale and consumption, as we have sold our Indiana farm and we have paused construction activities at our Ohio farm. We are engaged in genetic, genomic, fish health and fish nutrition research, which drive continuous improvement in our operations and may lead to new, disruptive technologies and products that could further expand our competitive offerings. Company Update We have been pursuing a growth strategy that includes the construction of large-scale recirculating aquaculture system farms for producing our GE Atlantic salmon. Our farm in Pioneer, Ohio was under construction and roughly 30 complete, but construction activities were paused in 2023. To fund the construction cost, we were using cash on hand, which was to be supplemented by a municipal bond financing. However, during the initial two years of construction, the cost estimate for the farm increased substantially and eventually exceeded our ability to complete the proposed financing. Consequently, we require new financing to provide liquidity for working capital and to fund the completion of our farm in Pioneer, Ohio. To meet this need, we have engaged an investment bank to pursue a range of funding and strategic alternatives, including the completed sale of our Indiana farm. We continue to pursue funding sources, including our decision to sell our Rollo Bay farm, the sale of non-core equipment assets from our Ohio farm, debt financing secured by our unencumbered assets, and potential strategic transactions. Inflation Recently, elevated global inflation rates continue to impact all areas of our business. We are experiencing higher costs for farming supplies, wage rates, and other direct operating expenses, as well as for capital expenditures related to the construction of our farm in Ohio. We expect inflation to continue to negatively impact our results of operations for the near-term. Financial Overview We expect our future capital requirements will be substantial, particularly as we continue to develop our business and expand our commercial activities. Product Revenue We have generated product revenue primarily through the sales of our GE Atlantic salmon, supplemented by sales of conventional Atlantic salmon, salmon eggs, fry, and byproducts. With the sale of our Indiana farm, our product revenues will consist of conventional Atlantic salmon eggs and salmon byproducts from our Fortune Bay farm on Prince Edward Island for the near term. Product Costs Product costs include the labor and related costs for producing our Atlantic salmon eggs and to grow out our fish and fry, including feed, oxygen, and other direct costs; overhead; and the cost to process and ship our products to customers. A portion of production costs is absorbed into inventory as fish eggs or fish in process to the extent that these costs do not exceed their net realizable value. The costs that are not absorbed into inventory, as well as any net realizable value inventory adjustments, are classified as product costs.

Sales and Marketing Expenses Our sales and marketing expenses currently include salaries and related costs for our sales personnel and agency fees for market-related activities. Research and Development Expenses We recognize research and development expenses as they are incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses for personnel in research and development functions; fees paid to contract research organizations and consultants who perform research for us; and costs related to laboratory supplies used in our research and development efforts. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees in executive, corporate, and finance functions. Other significant general and administrative expenses include corporate governance and public company costs, regulatory affairs, rent and utilities, insurance, and legal services. Long-lived Asset Impairment In the first quarter of 2024, we commenced a process to identify a potential buyer for our Indiana farm. This decision resulted in a 4.3 million non-cash impairment charge against long-lived assets and a 1.0 million net realizable value adjustment of inventory at the Indiana farm. The impairment charge was based on the best available information at the time regarding the potential sale price for the farm. In the second quarter of 2024, we began marketing the Indiana farm for sale and on June 28, 2024, we signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement with a buyer for a sale price of 9.5 million less transaction expenses, which included certain equipment assets that had been purchased for our Ohio farm. Based on this agreement, we recorded an additional non-cash impairment charge of 18.2 million and classified the assets to be sold in the transaction as Assets Held for Sale on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2024. The transaction closed on July 26, 2024, and we received proceeds of 9.0 million at closing and 500 thousand on October 17, 2024. Related transaction expenses were 305 thousand. In the second quarter of 2024, we initiated a plan to sell additional equipment from our Ohio farm to generate liquidity, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of 26.3 million. We sold some of this equipment for net proceeds of 506 thousand. The remaining equipment assets were classified as Assets Held for Sale on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, we began to market our Rollo Bay farm on Prince Edward Island, Canada for sale and reclassified the net book value of 9.8 million for the associated assets as Assets Held for Sale on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. Other Expense Interest expense includes the interest on our outstanding loans and other interest expense. Other (expense) income, net includes bank charges, fees, gains or losses on asset sales, and interest income. Results of Operations Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage (all dollar amounts in thousands):

 Product Revenue Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (unaudited) Harvest of GE Atlantic salmon (mt) - 144 (144) (100) Product revenue GE Atlantic salmon revenue - 632 (632) (100) Non-GE Atlantic salmon revenue 32 89 (57) (64) Other revenue 16 12 4 33 Total product revenue 48 733 (685) (93) 
 The decrease in revenue during the current period was primarily the result of the decrease in the sale of GE Atlantic salmon due to the sale of the Indiana farm. Product Costs Product costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to the sale of the Indiana farm. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in personnel costs, marketing programs, and share-based compensation costs in our efforts to reduce operating spend. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and project spending in our efforts to reduce operating spend. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in personnel costs, state excise tax liabilities, professional services, legal fees, share-based compensation costs, and travel in our efforts to reduce operating spend. Other Expense Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of interest expense, bank charges and gains or losses on asset sales, less interest income, and other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is comprised of interest expense and bank charges, less interest income. Interest expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 included the costs for our bridge loan.

Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage (all dollar amounts in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, Dollar 2024 2023 Change Change (unaudited) Product revenue 705 1,919 (1,214) (63) Operating expenses: Product costs 6,543 11,446 (4,903) (43) Sales and marketing 188 584 (396) (68) Research and development 236 486 (250) (51) General and administrative 7,835 8,403 (568) (7) Long-lived asset impairment 48,733 - 48,733 Operating loss 62,830 19,000 43,830 231 Other expense (2,247) (133) (2,114) 1,589 Net loss 65,077 19,133 45,944 240 
 Product Revenue Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (unaudited) Harvest of GE Atlantic salmon (mt) 415 369 46 12 Product revenue GE Atlantic salmon revenue 395 1,779 (1,384) (78) Non-GE Atlantic salmon revenue 292 124 168 135 Other revenue 18 16 2 13 Total product revenue 705 1,919 (1,214) (63) 
 The decrease in revenue during the current period was primarily the result of the decrease in the sale of GE Atlantic salmon due to the sale of the Indiana farm, partially offset by increased sales of conventional Atlantic salmon, eggs and fry from our Rollo Bay farm. The wind down of operations at the Indiana farm required harvesting predominantly below-market sized fish, which impacted the average selling price during the current period. Product Costs Product costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to the sale of the Indiana farm. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in personnel costs, marketing programs, travel, and share-based compensation costs in our efforts to reduce operating spend. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and project spending in our efforts to reduce operating spend. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were down from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in personnel costs, state excise tax liabilities, share-based compensation costs, and travel, in our efforts to reduce operating spend, partially offset by increases in legal fees.

Long-lived Asset Impairment During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of 48.7 million against the long-lived assets of the Indiana farm and certain equipment assets of the Ohio farm. We determined the impairment charge, based on the estimate of the potential market value of the asset group to be sold or available for sale, net of selling costs, compared to the current net book value of those assets. Other Expense Other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is comprised of interest expense, bank charges and gains or losses on asset sales, less interest income, and other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is comprised of interest expense and bank charges, less interest income. Interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included the costs for our bridge loan. Cash Flows The following table sets forth the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods set forth below (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, Dollar 2024 2023 Change Change (unaudited) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (12,700) (18,462) 5,762 (31) Investing activities 6,789 (66,260) 73,049 (110) Financing activities (2,788) (148) (2,640) 1,784 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (4) (1) (3) 300 Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (8,703) (84,871) 76,168 (90) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily comprised of our 65.1 million net loss, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and share-based compensation charges of 1.1 million, long-lived asset impairment charges of 48.7 million, and working capital sources of 2.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily comprised of our 19.1 million net loss and working capital uses of 1.4 million, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and share-based compensation charges of 2.0 million. Spending on operations decreased in the current period, before the recording of non-cash asset impairment charges against the Indiana farm and certain equipment assets of the Ohio farm, due to reductions in personnel, marketing programs, outside research projects, professional services, and share-based compensation. Increases in c ash provided by working capital was due to reductions in inventory and other current assets and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash Flows from Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 2.7 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment at our farm sites, and we received 9.5 million from the sale of our Indiana farm and certain equipment from our Ohio farm. During the same period in 2023, we used 66.3 million for construction activities and the purchase of equipment at our farm sites. Cash Flows from Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 6.8 million from new debt and made 9.5 million in term debt repayments. During the same period in 2023, we received 394 thousand from new debt and made 542 thousand in term debt repayments. Future Capital Requirements Since inception, we have incurred cumulative net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 500 thousand of cash and cash equivalents. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital, and there can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts, on a timely basis, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. This raises substantial doubt about our 

 17 
 Table of Contents 

ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In April 2024, we entered into a Loan Agreement with JMB Capital Partners Lending, LLC to fund working capital through a secured term loan of up to 10 million that was scheduled to mature on July 31, 2024 or, if earlier, upon the sale of certain collateral or upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Loan Agreement). Of the total loan amount, 5 million was advanced in April 2024 and 1.5 million was advanced in July 2024. The loan bore interest at a rate of 15 on its outstanding principal balance and was subject to a commitment fee equal to 5 and an exit fee equal to 8 . Of the initial loan advancement, approximately 2.8 million was used to pay the remaining outstanding balance of our term loan with First Farmers Bank Trust, upon which the 1 million of restricted cash held by us as of December 31, 2023 was no longer deemed to be restricted. The outstanding loan balance of 6.5 million was repaid on July 26, 2024 from the net proceeds of the Indiana farm sale. On July 26, 2024, we completed the sale of our Indiana farm, along with certain equipment assets from our Ohio farm for net proceeds of 9.2 million. We plan to sell our Rollo Bay farm and additional equipment assets from our Ohio farm in order to increase our cash liquidity and fund our ongoing operations. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate positive cash flows from operating activities, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of sales of non-core assets, equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of holders of our common stock will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to generate additional funds in a timely manner, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to maintain our currently planned operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to these estimates, or the policies related to them, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For a full discussion of these estimates and policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Smaller Reporting Company Status We are a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million and our annual revenue was less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The following sections provide quantitative information on our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. We make use of sensitivity analyses, which are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions. Interest Rate Risk Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with debt financing that we utilize from time to time to fund operations or specific projects. The interest on this debt is usually determined based on a fixed rate and is contractually set in advance. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1.8 million and 4.6 million, respectively, in interest-bearing debt instruments on our consolidated balance sheet. All of our interest-bearing debt is at fixed rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. The functional currency of our Canadian Subsidiary is the Canadian Dollar, and the functional currency of our U.S. and Brazil subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar. For the Canadian Subsidiary, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at the historical exchange rate, and the income statement accounts are translated at the average rate for each period during the year. Net translation gains or losses are adjusted directly to a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders equity. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based upon the evaluation described above that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are not party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our future business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. We may, from time to time, be subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the normal course of business activities. Item 1A. Risk Factors As disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on April 1, 2024, there are a number of risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risk factors are either new or have changed materially from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In evaluating our business, you should carefully review the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, and in other reports we file with the SEC. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on 

 19 
 Table of Contents 

our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. If that were to happen, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This Quarterly Report on Form 10 - Q also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below, elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our Annual Report on Form 10 - K. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for information relating to these forward-looking statements. We have a history of net losses and will likely incur future losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability. In the period from incorporation to September 30, 2024, we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately 286 million. These losses reflect our personnel, research and development, production and marketing costs. Our ability to realize revenues and the timing thereof are not certain, and achieving revenues does not assure that we will become profitable. We anticipate incurring additional losses until such time that we can generate significant increases to our revenues, and/or reduce our operating costs and losses. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to grow our business and increase our revenues. We expect our expenses to fluctuate as we transform our business. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Since inception, we have incurred cumulative net losses and negative cash flows from operations and expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 500 thousand in cash and cash equivalents. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital, and there can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts, on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date hereof. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Until such time as we reach profitability, we will require additional financing to fund our operations and execute our business plan. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
