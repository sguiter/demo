CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION 

This report includes forward-looking statements
that relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results, levels
of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Words such as, but not limited to,
 believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, plan, 
 targets, likely, aim, will, would, could, and similar
expressions or phrases identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations
and future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operation, business strategy and
financial needs. 

You should read thoroughly this report and the
documents that we refer to herein with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from and/or worse
than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements including those made in this report,
in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors also appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some examples of risk factors which may affect our business are as follows: 

our lack of significant revenues, positive cash flow and history of losses, 

market acceptance of our products and competition; 

our ability to attract and retain customers for existing and new products; 

our ability to effectively maintain and update our technology and product and service portfolio; 

our reliance on third party software and developers; 

breaches of network or IT security and presentation attacks; 

our ability to hire and retain key personnel and additional talent; 

our ability to raise capital under acceptable terms; 

our ability to maintain listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; 

our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property, or the loss of some of our intellectual property rights through costly litigation or administrative proceedings; 

our ability to operate in non-US markets; 

the impact of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; 

stock price and market volatility and the risk of securities litigation; 

legislation and government regulation; and 

general economic conditions, inflation and access to capital. 

Other sections of this report include additional
factors which could adversely impact our business and financial performance. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible
for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information under the Federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to release
publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. These
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, and you should not rely on these statements without also considering
the risks and uncertainties associated with these statements and our business.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

As used in this Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, except where the context otherwise requires, the term we, 
 us, our, authID or the Company, refers to the business of authID Inc. and its
subsidiaries. 

Overview 

authID ensures cyber-savvy enterprises
 Know Who s Behind the Device TM for every customer or employee login and transaction.
Through its easy-to-integrate, patented, biometric identity platform, authID quickly and accurately verifies a user s
identity, eliminating any assumption of who is behind a device and preventing cybercriminals from taking over
accounts. authID combines digital onboarding, biometric passwordless authentication and account recovery, with a fast,
accurate, user-friendly experience delivering identity verification in 700ms. Establishing a biometric root of trust
for each user that is bound to their accounts, or provisioned devices, authID stops fraud at onboarding, eliminates password
risks and costs, and provides the faster, frictionless, and more accurate user identity experience demanded by
operators of today s digital ecosystems. 

Our Platform 

Our Verified TM cloud-based platform
was developed with internally developed software as well as acquired and licensed technology and provides the following core services: 

Biometric Identity Verification 

Biometric Identity Authentication 

Account / Access Recovery 

FIDO Passkey binding 

Biometric Identity Verification 

Biometric identity verification establishes the
trusted identity of a user based on a variety of ground truth sources, including government-issued identity documents such as national
IDs, driver s licenses and passports or electronic machine-readable travel documents (or eMRTDs). Our Verified TM platform
detects presentation attack and spoofing threats, evaluates the authenticity of security features present on a government-issued identity
document, and biometrically matches the reference picture of the document with a live user s selfie (a photograph that the user
has taken of themselves). Usually occurring at account opening or onboarding, identity verification ensures that the enterprise knows
that the person interacting with the enterprise is who they say they are, in real time. authID s Proof TM identity verification
product eliminates the need for costly and less accurate face-to-face, in-person ID checks and instead provides a verified identity in
seconds. In a digital, online world of increasing fraud and security threats, Proof speeds up onboarding and offers our customers confidence
in the identities of consumers, employees or third-party vendors.

Biometric Identity Authentication 

Biometric identity authentication provides any
organization with a secure, convenient solution to validate that an individual is the verified account owner for various purposes including
passwordless login and performing specific transactions, or functions. The authID Verified product allows users to confirm their identity
with their facial biometric by simply taking a selfie on a mobile phone or device of their choosing (as opposed to dedicated hardware).
The solution includes a patented audit trail created for each transaction, containing the digitally signed transaction details, with proof
of identity authentication and consent. 

Account Access and Recovery 

authID s Verified biometric identity authentication
solution allows users to recover, via a facial biometric, account access that is lost or blocked due to expired credentials, lockouts,
lost or stolen devices, or compromised accounts. Because the account owner s root of trust is established in the cloud, recovery
is independent of any device or hardware. In this way, account recovery is instant, portable, and does not require the presence of or
access to a previously provisioned device in order to secure access from a different device. 

FIDO Passkey Binding 

FIDO Passkey Binding enables enterprises and their
users to bind biometrically verified user identities to FIDO2 passkeys, enabling strong authentication for device-based passwordless login
and transaction authentication that is tied to a trusted identity. This solution establishes a digital chain of trust between biometrically
verified individuals, their accounts, and their devices, thus eliminating passwords and protecting users and systems against fraud attacks. 

Key Customer Benefits 

Our solution allows our enterprise customers to: 

Verify and Authenticate
users. Customers can use the authID platform not only to verify the identity of new users, but also to authenticate those users seamlessly
on an ongoing basis to enable quick, secure logins and transaction authentications. 

Benefit from high-speed processing . Our solution returns a very low-latency response, key to enabling high-volume use cases (such as logins and high-value transactions) and providing a frictionless user experience. 

Precisely and accurately identify their consumers and employees, giving the enterprise complete confidence in who is accessing their digital assets 

Provide a seamless user experience in terms of speed and self-guided flow, so that even users who are not tech-savvy are easily able to complete the identity verification and authentication processes 

Support a wide variety of devices . Our cloud-based service is device agnostic and may be used to verify or authenticate users on any device with a camera, including shared devices, digital kiosks, etc. 

Integrate quickly and easily. We offer pre-integrated OIDC connections as well as integrations with several leading Identity and Access Management solutions. 

Offer broad identity document coverage. We can verify identities using a wide spectrum of government-issued documents from around the world.

Key Trends 

We believe that our financial results will be
impacted by several market trends in the identity verification and authentication markets, as well as expanding digital transformation
efforts across a wide range of market segments. These trends include: 

growing concerns over identity
theft, fraud and account takeover, resulting from the acceleration of digital transformation, for example online shopping and remote
working and the growth in AI assisted fraud; 

the growth in the sharing economy;
and 

the increase in electronic
payments and alternative money transfer solutions provided by both bank and non-bank entities. The key drivers for these alternative
payment methods are consumer demands for safe, convenient payment transactions, with less friction. 

Our results are also impacted by the changes in
levels of spending on identity verification, management and security methods, and thus, negative trends in the global economy and other
factors which negatively impact such spending may negatively impact the growth in our revenue from those products. The global economy
has been undergoing a period of political and economic uncertainty and stock markets are experiencing high levels of volatility, and it
is difficult to predict how long this uncertainty and volatility will continue. 

We plan to grow our business by increasing the
use of our services by our existing customers, by adding new customers through our direct salesforce, channel partners and by expanding
into new markets and innovation. If we are successful in these efforts, we would expect our revenue to continue to grow. 

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware
on September 21, 2011, and changed our name from Ipsidy Inc. to authID Inc. on July 18, 2022. Our corporate headquarters is located at
1580 North Logan Street, Suite 660, Unit 51767, Denver, CO 80203 and our main phone number is (516) 274-8700. Our website address is www.authid.ai.

Going Concern 

The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements included in this Quarterly Report have been prepared in accordance with United States GAAP assuming the Company will
continue on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the
next year following the issuance date of these financial statements. 

15 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of approximately 169.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company earned revenue from continuing operations
of approximately 0.7 million, used approximately 8.5 million to fund its operations, and incurred a net loss of approximately 9.6
million. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from the Company s stockholders
and noteholders, the ability of the Company to obtain additional debt or equity financing to continue operations, the Company s
ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, successfully locating and negotiating with other business entities for potential
acquisition and /or acquiring new clients to generate revenues and cash flows. In June 2024, the Company raised approximately 10.0 million
after expenses from existing and new stockholders through the sale of Common Stock pursuant to a registered direct offering. Going forward,
the Company plans to raise additional funds to support its operations and investments as it seeks to create a sustainable organization.
Our growth-oriented business plan to offer products to our customers will require continued capital investment and there is no guarantee
that such financing will be available, or available on acceptable terms. 

There is no assurance that the Company will ever
be profitable. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern. As there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve positive cash flows (become cash flow profitable)
and raise sufficient capital to maintain operations, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

This discussion includes information about Adjusted
EBITDA that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and
is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is included
below. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (1) interest expense
and debt discount and debt issuance costs amortization expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation
and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation expense (stock options) and (6) loss on debt extinguishment, and conversion expense on
exchange of Convertible Notes and certain other items management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Management believes
that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about
our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect
to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating
performance of our company and our management, and it will be a focus as we invest in and grow the business. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations
as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under
GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of certain charges or gains resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. 

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA
should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for
these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplement to our GAAP results.

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024
and September 30, 2023 Continuing Operations 

Revenues, net 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s
revenues were approximately 249,000 and 687,000, respectively, compared to approximately 43,000 and 118,000, respectively, in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, principally due to the recognition of revenue from new customer contracts signed in the
second half of 2023. 

General and administrative expenses 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, general and administrative expense decreased by approximately 0.9 million and
increased by 0.5 million, respectively. The decrease for the three month period was driven by lower stock-based compensation expense,
while the increase for the nine month period reflected a one-time event in 2023, representing an approximately 2.5 million reversal of
stock-based compensation in Q1 2023 on stock awards with market vesting conditions resulting from Q1 2023 terminations, which was not
repeated in 2024. This increase was partially offset by the reduction in employee-related expense due to cost savings from the 2023 restructuring
initiative. 

Research and development expenses 

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, research and development expenses increased by approximately
 0.9 million and 2.7 million, respectively. The increase was comprised of re-investment in employees and contractors following the 2023
restructuring as well as 0.8 million from the one-time reversal of stock-based compensation in Q1 2023 on stock awards with market vesting
conditions resulting from Q1 2023 terminations, which was not repeated in 2024. 

Depreciation and amortization expense 

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, depreciation and amortization expense was approximately 0.02 million and 0.08 million less,
respectively, as the Company reduced the value of certain legacy business asset values. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense includes interest expense, debt
issuance and discount amortization expense. Interest expense remained flat and increased 1.1 million, respectively, during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 principally due to the exchange of Convertible Notes for common
stock in May 2023. 

Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024
and September 30, 2023 Discontinued Operations 

On May 4, 2022, the Board approved a plan to exit
from certain non-core activities comprising the MultiPay correspondent bank, payments services in Colombia. 

17 

MultiPay business in Colombia 

In June 2023, MultiPay finalized the sale of the
Company s proprietary software to its major customer for approximately 96,000. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of approximately
 216,000 which included the release of a foreign currency translation gain of approximately 155,000. 

Although the Company exited the MultiPay business
in Colombia, it still maintains an authID customer support and operations team in Bogota which performs essential functions to support
the global operations of our Verified and Proof products. 

The Multipay entity has been dissolved as of August
2, 2024. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company has approximately 11.7 million of
cash on hand and approximately 11.2 million of working capital as of September 30, 2024. 

Cash used in operating activities was approximately
 8.5 million and 6.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash used in investing activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 18,000, compared with 17,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for purchases
of intangible assets. 

Cash provided by financing activities in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of approximately 10.0 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock, net of offering costs. 

Cash provided by financing activities in the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of approximately 6.3 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock, net of offering costs,
and 0.5 million initial drawdown net of debt issuance costs under the Company s A R Facility Agreement. 

In 2025, the Company will need to raise additional
funds to support its operations and investments as it seeks to create a sustainable organization. Our growth-oriented business plan to
offer products to our customers will require continued capital investment and there is no guarantee that such financing will be available,
or available on acceptable terms. 

There is no guarantee that our current business
plan will not change, and as a result of such change, we will need additional capital to implement such business plan. Further, assuming
we achieve our expected growth plan, of which there is no guarantee, we will need additional capital to implement growth beyond our current
business plan. 

Ukraine and the Middle East 

The war in Ukraine and the Middle East may impact
the Company and its operations in a number of different ways, which are yet to be fully assessed and are therefore uncertain. The Company s
principal concern is for the safety of the personnel who support us from those regions. The Company works with third party sub-contractors
for outsourced services, including software engineering and development, some of whom are based in Eastern Europe. The Company also works
with outsourced engineers and developers and third-party providers in other parts of the world, including the United States, Europe, India,
and Latin America. While the continuing impact of this conflict and the response of the United States and other countries to it by means
of trade and economic sanctions, or other actions is still unknown, it could disrupt our ability to work with certain contractors. The
Company has taken steps to diversify its sub-contractor base, which may in the short term give rise to additional costs and delays in
delivering software and product upgrades. 

18 

The uncertainty impacting and potential interruption
in energy and other supply chains resulting from military hostilities in Europe and the Middle East and the response of the United States
and other countries to it by means of trade and economic sanctions, or other actions, may give rise to increases in costs of goods and
services generally and may impact the market for our products as prospective customers reconsider additional capital expenditure, or other
investment plans until the situation becomes clearer. On the other hand, the threat of increased cyber-attacks from multiple threat actors,
including state-sponsored organizations may prompt enterprises to adopt additional security measures such as those offered by the Company. 

For so long as the hostilities continue and perhaps
even thereafter as the situation in Europe and the Middle East unfolds, we may see increased volatility in financial markets and a flight
to safety by investors, which may impact our stock price and make it more difficult for the Company to raise additional capital at the
time when it needs to do so, or for financing to be available upon acceptable terms. All or any of these risks separately, or in combination
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is deemed by our management to be material
to investors. 

Recent Accounting Policies 

The recent material accounting policies that may
be the most critical to understanding of the financial results and conditions are discussed in Note 1 of the unaudited financial statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to include disclosure under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the report that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 

19 

PART II 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, the Company is a party to various
legal or administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty,
we have no reason to believe the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results
of operations of the Company. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risk factors describing the major risks to our
business can be found under Item 1A, Risk Factors , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
There has been no material change in our risk factors from those previously discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted
a total of 220,000 options to certain new employees at exercise prices ranging from 6.29 to 9.61 per share. 

Mr. Mehta, a director of the Company, was granted
an option to purchase 13,282 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 7.78 per share. 12,500 of the shares vest annually in equal
amounts over a three-year period commencing in 2025 and 782 shares vested monthly in equal amounts over a three-month period commencing
March 2024. Mr. Mehta and the remaining non-employee directors were each granted options to purchase 15,627 shares of common stock at
an exercise price of 8.67 per share. 

Each non-employee director received an option
grant of 15,627 shares, on August 13, 2024, at an exercise price of 8.67, which was equal to the closing price of the common stock on
the NASDAQ Stock Market on that day. 

The Company issued 5,724 shares of common stock
in connection with the cashless exercise of stock options by employees. 

The issuance of the above securities is exempt
from the registration requirements under Rule 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or Rule 506 as promulgated under
Regulation D. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

None. 

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 

Not applicable to our operations. 

ITEM 5. 

Compensation for Non-employee Directors. 

In August 2024, the Board adopted a new policy
on compensation for non-employee directors, which is summarized as follows 

Each non-employee director will receive: 

Total annual compensation equal to 125,000, payable in cash and equity. 

Annual cash compensation of 8,000, or 10,000 if they are a committee chair, payable quarterly in arrear. 

20 

Annual equity compensation of 117,000 by way of an option grant to purchase common stock. The number of shares which will be the subject of each grant shall be determined by reference to the Black Scholes value of the grant based on the closing price of the common stock, as reported by the NASDAQ Stock Market (or such other principal securities exchange or market system on which the common stock is then listed,) on the date of the Annual Meeting, at which the director is re-elected by the stockholders to serve on the Board. Each stock option shall be a non-qualified stock option with a term of 10 years and shall become fully vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, with equal monthly vesting over a 12 month period, provided that such non-employee director remains as a director of the Company during such 12 month period. Each such option shall have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the common stock, as reported by the NASDAQ Stock Market, on the grant date. The grant date may be deferred in accordance with the Company s Policy on Granting Equity Awards, if the Annual Meeting is held during a closed trading window. 

In accordance with this new policy, each non-employee director received
an option grant of 15,627 shares, on August 13, 2024, at an exercise price of 8.67, which was equal to the closing price of the common
stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market on that day. 

Appointment of Mr. Soto. 

On September 23, 2024, Mr. Erick Soto was hired
as Chief Product Officer of the Company in consideration of an initial annual salary of 325,000. Mr. Soto and the CEO will mutually agree
as to the performance targets for Mr. Soto to earn an annual bonus of up to 20 of his annual base salary. Additionally, the Company agreed
to provide Mr. Soto with a grant of options to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock, for a period of ten years, vesting monthly over
36 months, subject to continued service. The grant date has been deferred in accordance with the Company s Policy on Granting Equity
Awards, until after the announcement of the Company s results for the period ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company also entered an Executive Retention Agreement with Mr.
Soto, pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide specified severance amounts and to accelerate the vesting on his equity awards upon
termination upon a change of control or an involuntary termination, as each term is defined in the agreement. In the event of a termination
upon a change of control or an involuntary termination, Mr. Soto is entitled to receive an amount equal to 12 months of his base salary.
In the event of a termination upon a change of control the Company agreed to accelerate the vesting of his equity awards. Further upon
termination upon a change of control or an involuntary termination, the exercise period of Mr. Soto s stock options shall be extended
so as to expire the lesser of four years after the date of termination, or the expiration of the relevant options. The Company also entered
a standard Director and Officer Indemnification Agreement with Mr. Soto.

1. Role and duties 

Non-executive
directors have the same general legal responsibilities to the Company as any other director. The Board as a whole is collectively responsible
for promoting the success of the Company by directing and supervising the Company s affairs, with a particular focus on strategy,

 parachute payments is necessary so that no portion of such amounts are subject to the excise tax under Code Section 4999,

order such that the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering such excise tax will be the

or elimination would accelerate or defer the timing of such payment in a manner that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code.

(as a short-term deferral ). The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described or referenced

subject to excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal,
state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999, results in Executive s receipt on an after-tax basis,
of the greatest amounts, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such amounts may be taxable under Code Section 4999. If a reduction
in the amounts constituting parachute payments is necessary so that no portion of such amounts are subject to the excise
tax under Code Section 4999, the reduction will occur in the following order: (i) reduction of the cash severance payments, which
will occur in reverse chronological order such that the cash payment owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering
such excise tax will be the first cash payment to be reduce; (ii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of Equity Award s which will occur
in the reverse order of the date of grant for such stock awards (i.e., the vesting of the most recently granted stock awards will be
reduced first); and (iii) reduction of continued employee benefits, which will occur in reverse chronological order such that the benefit
owed on the latest date following the occurrence of the event triggering such excise tax will be the first benefit to be reduced. If
two or more Equity Award s are granted on the same date, each Equity Award will be reduced on a pro-rata basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no such reduction or elimination shall apply to any non-qualified deferred compensation amounts (within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code) to the extent such reduction or elimination would accelerate or defer the timing of such payment in a manner that does not
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

10.7
 Section 409A of the Code . The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Section 409A
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder Section 409A ), to the extent subject
thereto, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this letter shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company
for purposes of any provision in this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits subject to Section 409A upon or
following a termination of employment until Executive would be considered to have incurred a separation from service from
the Company within the meaning of Section 409A and this Agreement shall be interpreted consistently therewith. Without limiting the foregoing,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent (a) any payments or benefits to which Executive becomes
entitled under this Agreement, or under any agreement or plan referenced herein, in connection with Executive s termination of
employment with the Company constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and (b) Executive is deemed at the time
of such termination of employment to be a specified employee under Section 409A of the Code, then such payments shall not
be made or commence until the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of Executive s
 separation from service (as such term is at the time defined in Treasury Regulations under Section 409A of the Code) from
the Company; or (ii) the date of Executive s death following such separation from service; provided, however, that such deferral
shall only be effected to the extent required to avoid adverse tax treatment to Executive, including (without limitation) the additional
twenty percent (20 tax for which Executive would otherwise be liable under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code in the absence of such
deferral. Upon the expiration of the applicable deferral period, any payments which would have otherwise been made during that period
(whether in a single sum or in installments) in the absence of this paragraph shall be paid to Executive or Executive s beneficiary
in one lump sum (without interest). Any termination of Executive s employment is intended to constitute a separation from
service as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1. It is intended that each installment of the payments
provided hereunder constitute separate and distinct payments for purposes of Section 1.409A of the Code. It is further
intended that payments hereunder satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemption from the application of Code Section 409A (and
any state law of similar effect) provided under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) (as a short-term deferral ).
The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described or referenced in this letter will be exempt from or comply
with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to any such payment, and Company s only obligation
is to comply with its obligations set forth herein. 

10.8
 Entire Agreement . This Agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding between the parties as to the subject matter
herein (whether oral or written and whether express or implied). The Executive hereby acknowledges, represents and warrants that they
have been individually represented by counsel in negotiating and signing this agreement.

In
Witness Whereof , each of the parties has executed this Agreement, in
the case of the Company, by its duly authorized officer, as of the day and year first above written.
