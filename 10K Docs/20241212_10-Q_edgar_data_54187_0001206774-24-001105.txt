the foreseeable future. Capital-based franchise taxes are recorded to administrative and general expense. State tax amounts in excess
of the capital-based franchise taxes are recorded to income tax expenses. Due to both the application of the capital-based tax and due
to the possible absence of city taxable income, the Company does not record city deferred taxes.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

W. MAYS, INC. 
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and related notes thereto contained in this report. In this discussion, the words Company , we , our 
and us refer to J.W. Mays, Inc., and subsidiaries. 

 Forward
Looking Statements: 

 The following
can be interpreted as including forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words outlook ,
 intend , plans , efforts , anticipates , believes , expects 
or words of similar import typically identify such statements. Various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are identified under the heading Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements below. Our actual results may vary significantly from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements
based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, availability of labor, marketing success, competitive conditions and the
change in economic conditions of the various markets we serve. 

 Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates: 

 Critical
accounting policies are defined as those most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and
require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amount of revenues, and expenses during the
reporting period and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Estimates are based on
historical experience, where applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. We
have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions and conditions. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates
during the three months ended October 31, 2024 from those disclosed in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2024 Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated by reference
into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended July 31, 2024. 

Results
of Operations: 

 In the three
months ended October 31, 2024, the Company reported net income of 26,657, or .01 per share. In the comparable three months ended October
31, 2023, the Company reported net loss of 192,544), or .10) per share. The increase in the 2024 three months was primarily due to
increased rent for existing tenants and several new leases combined with a net unrealized loss on marketable securities only in the 2023
three months. 

 Revenues
in the current three months increased to 5,539,129 from 5,323,801 in the comparable three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily
due to increased rent for existing tenants and several new leases; partially offset by the loss of a few tenants. 

 Real
estate operating expenses in the current three months increased to 3,750,139 from 3,692,616 in the comparable three months ended
October 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes and insurance expense; partially offset by decreases in building
maintenance costs. 

- 15 - 

 Table of Contents 

Administrative
and general expenses increased in the current three months to 1,292,753 from 1,254,573 in the comparable three months ended
October 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in legal and professional fees; partially offset by a reduction in payroll
cost. 

 Depreciation
expense in the current three months of 444,066 approximated 428,264 in the comparable three months ended October 31, 2023. 

 Other
income and interest expense improved in the current three months to (19,514) compared to (195,892) in the comparable three months
ended October 31, 2023, primarily due to a net unrealized loss on marketable securities only in the 2023 three months. 

 Liquidity
and Capital Resources: 

 Commercial
Leasing Activities 

 In
August 2024, a tenant extended its lease through June 30, 2025 with the same terms for 10,569
 square feet at the Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. 

 In
August 2024, the Company leased 2,051 square feet to an office tenant at the Company s Jamaica, New York premises for ten
years, with five separate one year renewal options. Monthly rent of approximately 5,500, with annual increases, is expected to
commence by January 1, 2025 when renovations to the premises are expected to be complete. The Company s costs of renovations
are expected to approximate 470,000, of which 235,000 will be reimbursed by the office tenant. 

 In August
2024, a tenant who occupies warehouse space at the Company s building in Circleville, Ohio, extended its lease from May 31, 2026
for additional three years to May 31, 2029. Effective November 1, 2024, the size of the leased premises expanded by 84,000 feet,
including space previously leased by another tenant whose lease expired October 31, 2024. After the lease expansion, annual base rent
for the warehouse space will be 877,440 per annum with increases annually. Brokerage commissions were 106,867. 

 Effective
October 1, 2024, the Company leased approximately 12,500 square feet at the Company s Fishkill, New York building for use as storage
space for three months expiring December 31, 2024. Total rent of 61,219 was prepaid at lease commencement and is being amortized as
revenue over the term of the lease. 

 In November
2024, a tenant who occupies 700 square feet at the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York agreed for a base rent
increase of 2,400 annually to expand their space to include an additional 130 square feet through lease expiration on January 31, 2026.

were completed in September, 2024. 

- 357,174
for tenant improvements at the Company s Jamaica, New York premises. Total improvements for this tenant should be complete prior
to January 1, 2025 and are expected to approximate 470,000, of which 235,000 will be reimbursed by the tenant. 

- 13,115
for various other improvements.

Source
of Funds; Cash Flows from Financing Activities; Company Indebtedness 

 Including
the estimated costs to complete improvements mentioned above, the Company anticipates incurring an additional 1.6 million in capital
expenditures over the next twelve months ending October 31, 2025. The Company s primary source of liquidity is 1) cash provided
by operations, and 2) borrowings. Total liquidity as of October 31, 2024 consists of cash and cash equivalents of 2,316,114. Total liquidity
includes proceeds from fixed rate borrowings as of October 31, 2024. 

 The
Company plans to negotiate terms on an existing 3,354,768 mortgage. At any time between April 1, 2025
and April 1, 2040, the bank may demand a balloon payment for the full amount outstanding. 

 Another
mortgage with a bank was fully paid off on December 1, 2024. The Company intends to explore other lending options to replace this
mortgage. 

 For a more
detailed description of the Company s indebtedness, see Note 5 - Mortgages Payable to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 We believe
our sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to meet our obligations as of October 31, 2024, and over the next 12 months. 

 Future
Liquidity 

 The Company s
ability to increase cash flows from operations, and to obtain additional sources of borrowings is dependent on many factors such as the
continuously evolving local and macroeconomic commercial real estate markets, the effects of the overall economy, fluctuating interest
rates, inflation, trends of office versus remote work practices, city state regulations, and increasing real estate tax assessments.
There is no assurance the Company will be successful in securing additional sources of financing when needed.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other sections of this Report on Form 10-Q,
and other reports and verbal statements made by our representatives from time to time may contain forward-looking statements that are
based on our assumptions, expectations and projections about us and the real estate industry. These include statements regarding our
expectations about revenues, our liquidity, or expenses and our continued growth, among others. Such forward-looking statements by their
nature involve a degree of risk and uncertainty. We caution that a variety of factors, including but not limited to the factors described
under Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 and the following, could cause business
conditions and our results to differ materially from what is contained in forward-looking statements: 

changes
 in the rate of economic growth, and interest rates both nationally and locally; 

the ability
 to obtain additional financing at reasonable costs and interest rates; 

changes
 in the financial condition of our customers; 

changes
 in the regulatory environment and particularly burdens of increasing local, state, and federal requirements and taxes; 

lease
 cancellations and particularly loss of key tenants; 

changes
 in our estimates of costs; 

loss
 of key personnel; 

war and/or
 terrorist attacks could significantly impact buildings leased to tenants; 

the continued
 availability of insurance for various policies at reasonable rates; 

outcomes
 of pending and future litigation; 

increasing
 competition by other companies; 

compliance
 with our loan covenants; 

climate
 change; 

recoverability
 of claims against our customers and others by us and claims by third parties against us; 

changes
 in estimates used in our critical accounting policies; 

cybersecurity
 threats or incidents; and 

pandemics
 and the related trends of office versus remote work practices. 
 
 Other factors
and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the formation of these forward-looking statements and the failure of such
other assumptions to be realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
Most of these factors are difficult to predict accurately and are generally beyond our control. You should consider the areas of risk
described above in connection with any forward-looking statements that may be made by us. 

 We undertake
no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
You are advised, however, to consult any additional disclosures we make in proxy statements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports
on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
