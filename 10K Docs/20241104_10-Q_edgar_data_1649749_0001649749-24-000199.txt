 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s AFS debt securities portfolio consisted of and individual securities, and of which were in an unrealized loss position, respectively. 
 The majority of the investment portfolio was either government guaranteed, an issuance of a government sponsored entity or highly rated by major credit rating agencies, and the Company has historically not recorded any credit losses associated with these investments. Municipal debt securities with market values below amortized cost at September 30, 2024 were reviewed for material credit events and/or rating downgrades with individual credit reviews performed. The issuers of these AFS debt securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities and the issuers will continue to be observed as a part of the Company s ongoing credit monitoring. As such, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, it was determined that all AFS debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis were due to noncredit-related factors. Further, it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Therefore, there was no allowance for credit losses recognized on AFS debt securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Periodically, AFS debt securities may be sold, or the composition of the portfolio realigned to improve yields, quality or marketability, or to implement changes in investment or asset/liability strategy, including maintaining collateral requirements and raising funds for liquidity purposes or preparing for anticipated changes in market interest rates.

 T he Company performed evaluations within its established qualitative framework, assessing the impact of the current economic outlook, including: continued actions taken by the Federal Reserve with regard to monetary policy, interest rates and the potential impact of those actions, potential impact of inflation on economic growth, potential negative economic forecasts, and other considerations. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans HFI as of September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023 is primarily the result of overall loan growth combined with an increased risk of potential deterioration in the CRE portfolio which was qualitatively adjusted to address risks not otherwise captured by the credit loss model. These adjustments factor in the possibility that the economy may be nearing a recession, reflected through deterioration in asset quality projected over life of the loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, all CRE asset classes are expected to be negatively impacted by slowing demand coupled with refinancing risk in the current rate environment.

 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
 The Company enters into cash flow hedging relationships using interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to the variability in future cash flows or other forecast transactions associated with its floating rate assets and liabilities. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the repricing characteristics of its floating rate subordinated debt. All components of each derivative instrument s gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Any initial and ongoing assessment of expected hedge effectiveness is based on regression analysis. The ongoing periodic measures of hedge ineffectiveness are based on the expected change in cash flows of the hedged item caused by changes in the benchmark interest rate. 
 At December 31, 2023, the Company had interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges on subordinated debt with notional values totaling and market values totaling recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
 Derivatives not designated under hedge accounting rules include those that are entered into as either economic hedges as part of the Company s overall risk management strategy or to facilitate client needs. Economic hedges are those that are not designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge for accounting purposes but are necessary to economically manage the risk exposure associated with the assets and liabilities of the Company. 
 The Company enters into derivative instruments to help its commercial customers manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with customer contracts, the Company enters into an offsetting derivative contract. The Company manages its credit risk, or potential risk of default by its commercial customers through credit limit approval and monitoring procedures. 
 The Company enters into interest rate-lock commitments on residential loan commitments that will be held for resale. These are considered derivative instruments with no hedge accounting designation, and the interest rate exposure on these commitments is economically hedged primarily with forward contracts. Gains and losses arising from changes in the valuation of the interest rate-lock commitments are recognized currently in earnings and are reflected under the line-item mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of income. 
 The Company also enters into forwards, futures and option contracts to economically hedge the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights. Gains and losses associated with these instruments are included in earnings and are reflected under the line-item mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of income.

 Netting of Derivative Instruments 
 Certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset on the consolidated balance sheets when the right of offset exists or when the instruments are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, which includes the right of the non-defaulting party or non-affected party to offset recognized amounts, including collateral posted with the counterparty, to determine a net receivable or net payable upon early termination of the agreement. Certain of the Company s derivative instruments are subject to master netting agreements, however the Company has not elected to offset such financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the Company s gross derivative positions as recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as well as the net derivative positions, including collateral pledged to the extent the application of such collateral did not reduce the net derivative liability position below zero, had the Company elected to offset those instruments subject to an enforceable master netting agreement:

 Fair value for collateral-dependent loans is determined based on the estimated value of the collateral securing the loans, less estimated selling costs and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral. For loans secured by real estate, the fair value is determined based on appraisals performed by qualified appraisers and reviewed by qualified personnel. For non-real estate collateral, fair value is determined based on various sources, including third party asset valuation and internally determined values based on cost adjusted or other judgmentally determined factors. and , respectively. The allowance for credit losses is calculated as the amount for which the loan s amortized cost basis exceeds fair value.

ITEM 2 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
 
 The following is a discussion of our financial condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, and with the accompanying unaudited notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements set forth in this Report. 
 Forward-looking statements 
 Certain statements contained in this Report that are not historical in nature may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the Company s future plans, results, strategies, and expectations, including expectations around changing economic markets. These statements can generally be identified by the use of the words and phrases may, will, should, could, would, goal, plan, potential, estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, expect, target, aim, predict, continue, seek, and other variations of such words and phrases and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon management s current expectations, estimates, and projections, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company s control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that such expectations, estimates, and projections will be achieved. Accordingly, the Company cautions shareholders and investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, (1) current and future economic conditions, including the effects of inflation, interest rate fluctuations, changes in the economy or global supply chain, supply-demand imbalances affecting local real estate prices, and high unemployment rates in the local or regional economies in which the Company operates and/or the US economy generally, (2) changes in government interest rate policies and its impact on the Company s business, net interest margin, and mortgage operations, (3) any continuation of the recent turmoil in the banking industry, including the associated impact to the Company and other financial institutions of any regulatory changes or other mitigation efforts taken by government agencies in response, (4) increased competition for deposits, (5) the Company s ability to effectively manage problem credits, (6) any deterioration in commercial real estate market fundamentals, (7) the Company s ability to identify potential candidates for, consummate, and achieve synergies from, potential future acquisitions, (8) the Company s ability to successfully execute its various business strategies, (9) changes in state and federal legislation, regulations or policies applicable to banks and other financial service providers, including legislative developments, (10) the effectiveness of the Company s cybersecurity controls and procedures to prevent and mitigate attempted intrusions, (11) the Company s dependence on information technology systems of third party service providers and the risk of systems failures, interruptions, or breaches of security, and (12) the impact of natural disasters, pandemics, and/or acts of war or terrorism, (13) events giving rise to international or regional political instability, including the broader impacts of such events on financial markets and/or global macroeconomic environments, and (14) general competitive, economic, political, and market conditions. Further information regarding the Company and factors which could affect the forward-looking statements contained herein can be found in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in any of the Company s subsequent filings with the SEC. Many of these factors are beyond the Company s ability to control or predict. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, shareholders and investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Report, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict their occurrence or how they will affect the Company. The Company qualifies all forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements .

 GAAP reconciliation and management explanation of non-GAAP financial measures 
 We identify certain financial measures discussed in this Report as being non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Report are adjusted efficiency ratio (tax-equivalent basis), tangible book value per common share, tangible common equity to tangible assets and return on average tangible common equity. 
 In accordance with the SEC s rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in our selected historical consolidated financial data may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in our selected historical consolidated financial data when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. The following reconciliation tables provide a more detailed analysis of these, and reconciliation for, each of non-GAAP financial measures. 
 Core efficiency ratio (tax-equivalent basis) 
 The core efficiency ratio (tax-equivalent basis) is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain gains, losses and other selected items. Our management uses this measure in its analysis of our performance. Our management believes this measure provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains and charges. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is the efficiency ratio.

Tangible book value per common share and tangible common equity to tangible assets 
 Tangible book value per common share and tangible common equity to tangible assets are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of goodwill and other intangibles used by management to evaluate capital adequacy. Because intangible assets, such as goodwill and other intangibles, vary extensively from company to company, we believe that the presentation of this information allows investors to more easily compare our capital position to other companies. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value per common share and our total shareholders equity to total assets. 
 The following table presents, as of the dates set forth below, tangible common equity compared with total common shareholders equity, tangible book value per common share compared with our book value per common share and common equity to tangible assets compared to total common shareholders equity to total assets :

 Return on average tangible common equity 
 Return on average tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure that uses average shareholders equity and excludes the impact of goodwill and other intangibles. This measurement is used by management to provide a depiction of our profitability without being impacted by intangible assets, as intangible assets are not directly managed to generate earnings. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is return on average common shareholders' equity. 
 The following table presents, as of the dates set forth below, reconciliations of total average tangible common equity to average shareholders equity and return on average tangible common equity to return on average shareholders equity:

 Overview of recent financial performance 
 Results of operations 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Our net income decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 10.2 million from 19.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted earnings per common share were 0.22 and 0.41 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net income represented a ROAA of 0.32 and 0.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a ROAE of 2.67 and 5.46 for the same periods. Our ROATCE for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.19 and 6.67 , respectively. See GAAP reconciliation and management explanation of non-GAAP financial measures in this Report for a discussion of tangible common equity and return on average tangible common equity. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest income increased to 106.0 million compared with 100.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 3.55 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by higher rates for loans HFI and taxable AFS debt securities offset by a smaller increase in the volume of interest-earnings assets compared to interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 24.5 million to a loss of 16.5 million, compared to 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of management s election to sell 318.6 million of AFS debt securities, which resulted in a 40.2 million net loss on investment securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 14.2 million net loss on investment securities primarily related to the sale of 76.6 million of AFS debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the section Other earnings assets for additional information on the sale of the AFS debt securities. 
 Noninterest expense decreased to 76.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 83.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense is due to decreases in salaries, commissions and employee benefits of 7.0 million primarily related to the Company s efficiency and scalability initiatives and updated methodology of deferrals for loan fees and loan origination expenses. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Our net income decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 78.2 million from 90.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Diluted earnings per common share were 1.67 and 1.94 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net income represented a ROAA of 0.83 and 0.95 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a ROAE of 7.02 and 8.86 for the same periods. Our ROATCE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 8.45 and 10.9 , respectively. See GAAP

reconciliation and management explanation of non-GAAP financial measures in this Report for a discussion of tangible common equity and return on average tangible common equity. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest income increased to 308.1 million from 306.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 3.51 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 3.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by higher interest rates mostly offset by our volume of interest-earnings assets decreasing compared to an increase in our interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 38.1 million to 17.1 million, down from 55.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a 56.4 million net loss on investment securities related to the sale of 526.4 million of AFS debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 14.2 million net loss on investment securities primarily related to the sale of 76.6 million of AFS debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the section Other earnings assets for additional information on the sale of the AFS debt securities. The decrease was partially offset by a 2.1 million increase in investment services and trust income and a 2.1 million cash life insurance benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Noninterest expense decreased to 223.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 244.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense is due to decreases in salaries, commissions and employee benefits of 16.9 million primarily related to the Company s efficiency and scalability initiatives and updated methodology of deferrals for loan fees and loan origination expenses. Additionally, the decrease is reflective of decreases in advertising, legal and professional expenses and franchise tax expense.

This decrease includes a net loss on investment securities of 40.2 million associated with the sale of 318.6 million AFS debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 14.2 million net loss on investment securities primarily related to the sale of 76.6 million of AFS debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expense decreased to 63.3 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 68.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to a decrease in salaries associated with our efficiency and scalability initiatives and updated methodology of deferrals for loan fees and loan origination expenses. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Income before taxes from the Banking segment decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 93.2 million, compared to 116.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income increased by 2.6 million to 304.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 301.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Provisions for credit losses on loans HFI and unfunded loan commitments resulted in 5.1 million of provision expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Banking segment recorded a noninterest loss of 19.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to income of 18.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease includes a net loss on investment securities of 56.4 million associated with the sale of 526.4 million AFS debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with a net loss on investment securities of 14.2 million as noted above for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest expense decreased to 
 55 

186.0 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 201.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreases in salaries, advertising, legal and professional fees and franchise tax expense. 
 Mortgage 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Activity in our Mortgage segment resulted in a pre-tax net contribution of 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 0.2 million pre-tax net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income was 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Provisions for credit losses on loans HFI and unfunded loan commitments resulted in provision expense of 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a reversal of 0.4 million of provision expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Mortgage banking income decreased 0.4 million to 11.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As noted below, mortgage banking income includes origination fees and realized gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans, change in fair value of mortgage loans and derivatives, and mortgage loan servicing fees, which includes the net change in fair value of MSRs and related derivatives. Mortgage banking income is initially driven by the recognition of interest rate lock commitments at fair value at inception. This is subsequently adjusted for changes in the overall interest rate environment offset by derivative contracts entered into to mitigate the interest rate exposure. Upon sale of the loan, the net fair value gain is reclassified as a realized gain on sale. 
 The components of mortgage banking income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Mortgage banking income Gains and fees from origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale 9,279 8,941 Net change in fair value of loans held for sale and derivatives (480) (582) Change in fair value on MSRs, net of hedging (4,490) (3,724) Mortgage servicing income 7,244 7,363 Total mortgage banking income 11,553 11,998 Interest rate lock commitment volume 381,240 373,068 Interest rate lock commitment volume by purpose ): Purchase 82.5 88.5 Refinance 17.5 11.5 Mortgage sales 327,270 325,321 Mortgage sale margin 2.84 2.75 Closing volume 317,502 328,169 Outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans serviced 10,402,118 10,875,274 
 Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 12.9 million and 14.3 million, respectively. This decrease is reflective of a decrease in salaries and employee benefits associated with our efficiency and scalability initiatives. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Activity in our Mortgage segment resulted in a pre-tax net contribution of 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 2.0 million pre-tax net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Provisions for credit losses on loans HFI and unfunded loan commitments resulted in a reversal of 0.2 million of provision expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a reversal of 0.1 million of provision expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Mortgage banking income decreased 0.3 million to 36.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 36.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Results of operations 
 Throughout the following discussion of our operating results, we present our net interest income, net interest margin and core efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis. The fully tax-equivalent basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. 
 Our tax-exempt income is converted to a tax-equivalent basis by adjusting for the combined federal and blended state statutory income tax rate of 26.06 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Net interest income 
 Net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings, generally comprising over 50 of our total revenues in a given period. Net interest income and margin are shaped by many factors, primarily the volume, term structure and mix of earning assets, funding mechanisms, and interest rate fluctuations. Other factors include accretion or amortization of discounts or premiums on purchased loans, prepayment risk on mortgage and investment related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities. Funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources. Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding, net interest income and margin. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. Treasury yield curve continued its path towards normalization and became less inverted as long-term note and bond rates decreased at a slower pace than shorter-term note rates. The curve remained inverted as of September 30, 2024, which is in contrast to the more normalized upward sloping U.S. Treasury yield curve exhibited during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Federal Funds Target Rate range was 4.75 - 5.00 and 5.25 - 5.50 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the Federal Open Market Committee s September 18, 2024 meeting, the federal funds rate was lowered 50 basis points, which was the first rate change since July 2023. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income increased to 106.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 101.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net interest income was driven by a 11.5 million increase in interest income partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 6.6 million. Further discussion of the changes to interest income and expense are discussed below. 
 57 

Interest income was 186.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 174.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 11.5 million, which was primarily driven by an increase in yields and somewhat by an increase in volume of loans HFI and taxable investment securities. 
 Interest income on loans HFI increased 4.7 million to 157.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 153.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher yields with a secondary driver of increased volume. The yield on loans HFI was 6.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, up 16 basis points from the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The components of our loan yield for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Interest income Average yield Interest income Average yield Loan HFI yield components: Contractual interest rate on loans HFI (1) 
 155,884 6.62 147,806 6.32 Origination and other loan fee income 1,779 0.08 4,345 0.19 (Amortization) accretion on purchased loans (10) 312 0.01 Nonaccrual interest collections 98 575 0.02 Total loan HFI yield 157,751 6.70 153,038 6.54 (1) Includes tax equivalent adjustment using combined marginal tax rate of 26.06 . 
 Interest income on taxable investment securities increased 7.5 million to 13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of AFS debt securities that were sold during the second half of 2023 and first nine months of 2024 to higher yielding U.S. government agency and mortgage-backed securities. The yield on taxable investment securities increased 184 basis points to 3.73 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense was 79.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.6 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was driven equally by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities which increased interest expense 3.6 million and an increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities which increased interest expense 3.0 million over the comparative time period. Increases in average balances of interest-bearing liabilities were led by brokered and internet time deposits of 140.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the issuance of brokered deposits as we took advantage of favorable relative terms available during the quarter. Notable contributors to the increase in interest expense are attributable to the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including money market and customer time deposits, which increased 2.7 million and 1.6 million, respectively, from the three months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were most significantly influenced by increases in rates paid on these balances. The average rate on money market deposits increased 15 basis points to 3.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate on customer time deposits increased 60 basis points to 3.97 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 More broadly, total cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.33 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. As interest rates on deposits increase, we tend to experience some movement between deposit types as customers seek higher interest rates and shift from noninterest-bearing deposit accounts to interest-bearing deposit products.

 (1,339) 6,211 4,872 (1) Average loans are presented gross, including nonaccrual loans and overdrafts (before deduction of allowance for credit losses on loans HFI). 
 (2) Interest income includes the effects of the tax-equivalent adjustments to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent 
 adjustment amounts included was 0.6 million and 0.8 million the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net interest income was relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, increasing 1.4 million to 310.1 million from 308.6 million. Increases in interest income of 35.1 million were largely offset by increases in interest expense of 33.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior period. The increase in interest income for the current year period was driven by an increase in yields on average earning assets incrementally offset by decreases in the average volume of interest-bearing deposits with other financial institutions. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven increases in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Interest income on loans HFI increased 26.0 million to 466.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 440.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to increasing yields. The average yield on loans HFI increased by 37 basis points period-over-period to 6.68 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 60 

from 6.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The components of our loan yield for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Interest income Average yield Interest income Average yield Loans HFI yield components: Contractual interest rate on loans HFI (1) 
 460,796 6.59 428,000 6.13 Origination and other loan fee income 4,506 0.06 11,353 0.16 Accretion on purchased loans 538 0.01 617 0.01 Nonaccrual interest collections 1,093 0.02 950 0.01 Total loans HFI yield 466,933 6.68 440,920 6.31 (1) Includes tax equivalent adjustment using combined marginal tax rate of 26.06 . 
 
 Interest income on taxable investment securities increased 15.6 million to 35.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of AFS debt securities that were sold during the second half of 2023 and first and third quarters of 2024 to higher yielding U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities. The yield on taxable investment securities increased 133 basis points to 3.22 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest income on interest-bearing deposits with other financial institutions decreased to 23.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 28.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease in volume of interest-bearing deposits with other financial institutions partially offset by higher yields. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits with other financial institutions decreased 187.0 million to 573.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 760.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-bearing deposits with other financial institutions increased 41 basis points to 5.41 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense was 231.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 33.6 million as compared to 197.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was largely attributed to a rise in the rate paid on interest-bearing deposit accounts, most notably, on money market and customer time deposit products. Interest expense on money market deposits increased 22.6 million to 112.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 89.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on customer time deposits increased 9.6 million to 41.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate on money market deposits increased 53 basis points to 3.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average rate on customer time deposits increased 99 basis points to 3.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.97 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The average balance of other borrowings increased 127.9 million to 129.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As a result, interest expense on other borrowings increased to 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The yield on other borrowings increased 275 basis points to 4.83 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.08 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due primarily of borrowings from the Bank Term Funding Program, which was paid-off at the end of this quarter. Refer to the section Borrowings for additional information on the BTFP.

 (2) Interest income includes the effects of the tax-equivalent adjustments to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. The net taxable-equivalent adjustment amounts included was 2.0 million and 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Provision for credit losses 
 The provision for credit losses charged to operating expense is an amount which, in the judgment of management, is necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level under the current expected credit loss model. The determination of the amount of the allowance is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. Refer to Note 1, Basis of presentation in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a detailed discussion regarding ACL methodology. 
 Our allowance for credit losses calculation as of September 30, 2024 resulted from management s best estimate of losses over the life of loans and unfunded commitments in our portfolio in accordance with the CECL approach. Our calculation included forecasts for projected slower GDP growth over the next two to three years and expected elevated unemployment levels. We also considered the current global economic environment, including continued pressures on supply chains (and more specifically, oil and energy) and increased uncertainty due to geopolitical turmoil and its impact 
 63 

on the U.S. economy. These factors may continue to lead to increased volatility in forecasted macroeconomic variables, a key input to our calculated level of allowance for credit losses. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 We recognized a provision for credit losses on loans HFI of 1.9 million and 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our provision for credit losses on loans HFI during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to reductions in balances outstanding for construction loans offset by growth in other classes of financing receivable in our loan portfolio. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans HFI was driven by decreased loan growth in our loans HFI combined with the economic variables signaling a possible recession in our forward-looking model partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on loans HFI due to a single commercial and industrial relationship moving to nonaccrual status during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 We also estimate expected credit losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate expected credit loss, we consider the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions. We recorded a provision expense for credit losses on unfunded commitments of 0.1 million and a reversal of provision expense of 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The reversal is due to a 9.3 million decrease in our unfunded commitments during the three months ended September 30, 2024, including a 6.7 million decrease in our construction portfolio. Commitments increased in commercial and industrial and residential real estate line of credit portfolios offset by reductions in construction and commercial real estate. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 it was determined that all AFS debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis were due to noncredit-related factors. Therefore, there was no provision for credit losses recognized on AFS debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 We recognized a provision for credit losses on loans HFI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 7.6 million and 13.6 million, respectively. The current period provision on loans HFI is due to growth in loan balances for most loan categories offset by significant decreases in construction lending. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase in the provision for credit losses on loans HFI was driven by a single commercial and industrial relationship moving to nonaccrual status during the period and the deteriorating economic forecasts. 
 We recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of 2.7 million and 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The reversal of provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is primarily due to management's concentrated effort to reduce unfunded loan commitments during the periods indicated including a 215.7 million and a 716.8 million decrease in our construction category as these projects primarily moved to permanent financing for the nine months ended nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Decreases in commitment balances for construction and commercial real estate were offset by increases in commercial and industrial and residential segments. This resulted in a 2.7 million and 11.4 million decrease in required ACL related to the unfunded commitments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, it was determined that all AFS debt securities that experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost basis were due to noncredit-related factors. Therefore, there was no provision for credit losses recognized on AFS debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Noninterest income 
 The following table sets forth the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Mortgage banking income 11,553 11,998 36,048 36,316 Investment services and trust income 3,721 3,072 10,338 8,227 Service charges on deposit accounts 3,378 2,959 9,686 9,197 ATM and interchange fees 2,840 2,639 8,598 7,664 Loss from investment securities, net (40,165) (14,197) (56,378) (14,156) (Loss) gain on sales or write-downs of other real estate owned and other assets (289) 115 (5) 465 Other income 2,465 1,456 8,786 7,491 Total noninterest (loss) income (16,497) 8,042 17,073 55,204 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Noninterest income amounted to a 16.5 million loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 24.5 million, or 305 , as compared to income of 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was driven by the net loss from investment securities. 
 Net loss from investment securities was 40.2 million and 14.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net loss from investment securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of management s election to sell 318.6 million of AFS debt securities to reinvest the proceeds of the sale into higher yielding AFS debt securities compared to a 14.2 million net loss on investment securities primarily related to the sale of 76.6 million of AFS debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the section Other earnings assets for additional information on the sale of the AFS debt securities. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Noninterest income amounted to 17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 38.1 million, or 69 , as compared to 55.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was driven by the net loss from investment securities, offset by increases in investment services and trust income and BOLI income recognized in other noninterest income. 
 Investment services and trust income increased 2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 10.3 million as compared to 8.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to fees earned from higher assets under management stemming from market value improvement and existing account growth, as well as customer acquisition efforts through a mix of financial advisors joining the Company bringing new business and the addition of new accounts by the financial advisors already at the Company. 
 Net loss from investment securities was 56.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss from investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of management s election to sell 526.4 million of AFS debt securities to reinvest the proceeds into higher yielding AFS securities compared to a 14.2 million net loss on investment securities primarily related to the sale of 76.6 million of AFS debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to the section Other earning assets for additional information on the sale of the AFS debt securities. 
 Other income increased 1.3 million to 8.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to a 2.1 million increase in BOLI income resulting from a cash life insurance benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 offset by a 0.9 million gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 associated with the change in fair value of the commercial loans held for sale portfolio that was exited during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Noninterest expense 
 The following table sets forth the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Salaries, commissions and employee benefits 47,538 54,491 138,381 155,299 Occupancy and equipment expense 6,640 6,428 19,582 18,618 Data processing 2,486 2,338 7,180 6,796 Advertising 1,947 2,124 4,977 6,258 Legal and professional fees 1,900 1,760 5,798 7,067 Amortization of core deposit and other intangibles 719 889 2,260 2,819 Other expense 14,982 14,967 45,547 47,872 Total noninterest expense 76,212 82,997 223,725 244,729 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Noninterest expense decreased by 6.8 million, or 8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 76.2 million as compared to 83.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense was attributable to a decrease in salaries, commissions and employee benefits. 
 Salaries, commissions and employee benefits expense is the largest component of noninterest expense and is comprised of salaries and wages in addition to other employee benefit costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 7.0 million, or 13 , to 47.5 million as compared to 54.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was attributable to the impact of the Company s efficiency and scalability initiatives, as well as a 2.9 million decrease from the Company applying an updated deferral methodology for loan fees and loan origination expenses. 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Noninterest expense decreased by 21.0 million, or 9 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 223.7 million as compared to 244.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense was attributable to a decrease in salaries, commissions and employee benefits, legal and professional fees, advertising expense, and franchise tax expense recognized in other noninterest expense offset slightly by a FDIC special assessment expense. 
 Salaries, commissions and employee benefits expense is the largest component of noninterest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, salaries, commissions and employee benefits expense decreased 16.9 million, or 11 , to 138.4 million as compared to 155.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was attributable to the impact of the Company s efficiency and scalability initiatives, as well as a 7.8 million decrease from the Company applying an updated deferral methodology for loan fees and loan origination expenses. 
 Advertising expense includes expenses related to sponsorships, advertising, marketing, customer relations and business development, and public relations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, advertising expense decreased 1.3 million to 5.0 million compared to 6.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to marketing rebate activity with partners earned through higher transaction volumes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Legal and professional fees decreased by 1.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 5.8 million as compared to 7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the completion of internal projects in the prior year. 
 Other noninterest expense primarily includes mortgage servicing expenses, regulatory fees and deposit insurance assessments, software license and maintenance fees and various other miscellaneous expenses. Other noninterest expense decreased 2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 45.5 million compared to 47.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a 3.1 million decrease in franchise tax expense which was partially offset by 0.5 million expense related to the FDIC special assessment.

Efficiency ratio 
 The efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is a measure of the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. This ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. For a core efficiency ratio, we exclude certain gains, losses and expenses we do not consider core to our business. 
 Our efficiency ratio was 85.1 and 68.8 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 76.2 and 67.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our core efficiency ratio, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 58.4 and 58.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 63.1 and 63.3 the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See GAAP reconciliation and management explanation of non-GAAP financial measures in this Report for a discussion of the core efficiency ratio. 
 Income taxes 
 Income tax expense was 1.2 million and 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 18.4 million and 23.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represents effective tax rates of 10.3 and 17.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 19.1 and 20.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The primary differences from the enacted rates are applicable state income taxes and certain expenses that are not deductible, reduced for non-taxable income. Refer to Note 7 Income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company s income tax expense and effective tax rates. 
 
 Financial condition 
 The following discussion of our financial condition compares balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Loan portfolio 
 The following table sets forth the balance and associated percentage of each class of financing receivable in our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated: 
 September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Committed Amount Outstanding of total outstanding Committed Amount Outstanding of total outstanding Loan Type: Commercial and industrial 3,003,498 1,688,815 18 2,982,967 1,720,733 18 Construction 1,589,883 1,079,726 11 2,123,177 1,397,313 15 Residential real estate: 1-to-4 family mortgage 1,615,696 1,612,031 17 1,569,525 1,568,552 17 Residential line of credit 1,326,977 591,049 6 1,231,038 530,912 6 Multi-family mortgage 665,959 654,188 7 627,387 603,804 6 Commercial real estate: Owner-occupied 1,392,083 1,324,208 14 1,305,503 1,232,071 13 Non-owner occupied 2,099,996 2,048,036 22 2,026,491 1,943,525 21 Consumer and other 497,397 480,076 5 437,382 411,873 4 Total loans 12,191,489 9,478,129 100 12,303,470 9,408,783 100 
 Our loans HFI portfolio is our most significant earning asset, comprising 73.4 and 74.6 of our total assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio by originating quality commercial and consumer type loans that comply with our credit policies and that produce revenues consistent with our financial objectives. Our overall lending approach is primarily focused on providing credit to our customers directly in the markets we serve. However, we are also party to loan syndications and participations from other banks (collectively, participated loans ). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, loans HFI included approximately 224.9 million and 254.6 million, respectively, related to participated loans. 
 67 

We also sell loan participations to unaffiliated third-parties as part of our credit risk management and balance sheet management strategy. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold 7.5 million and 14.5 million in loan participations, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold 24.5 million and 30.8 million in loan participations, respectively. All loans, whether or not we act as a participant, are underwritten to the same standards as all other loans we originate. We believe our loan portfolio is well-balanced, which provides us with the opportunity to grow while monitoring our loan concentrations. 
 Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Our lending activity is heavily concentrated in the geographic market areas we serve, with the highest concentration in Tennessee. This geographic concentration subjects our loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within the state. The risks created by this concentration have been considered by management in the determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on loans HFI. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10 of total loans other than our geographic exposure to Tennessee and Alabama, as well as the categories of loans disclosed in the table above. We believe our loan portfolio is diversified relative to industry concentrations across the various loan portfolio categories. For additional details related to the concentrations within our loan portfolio, refer to the industry classification and collateral property type concentration tables detailed later in this section. 
 Banking regulators have established guidelines of less than 100 of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in construction lending and less than 300 of tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses in commercial real estate lending that management monitors as part of the risk management process. The construction concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding construction and land development loans to total tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. The commercial real estate concentration ratio is a percentage of the outstanding balance of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily, and construction and land development loans to tier 1 capital plus allowance for credit losses. Management strives to operate within the thresholds set forth above.

Loan categories: 
 The principal categories of our loans held for investment portfolio are discussed below: 
 Commercial and industrial loans. 
 Commercial and industrial loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses, and farmers for working capital and operating needs and business expansions. This category also includes loans secured by manufactured housing receivables made primarily to manufactured housing communities. Commercial and industrial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. Commercial and industrial loans are generally made with operating cash flows as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and personal guarantees. 
 Construction loans. 
 Construction loans include commercial construction, land acquisition and land development loans and single-family interim construction loans to small and medium-sized businesses and individuals. These loans are generally secured by the land or the real property being built and are made based on our assessment of the value of the property on an as-completed basis and repayment depends upon project completion and sale, refinancing, or operation of the real estate. 
 1-4 family mortgage loans. 
 Our residential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans are primarily made with respect to and secured by single family homes, including manufactured homes with real estate, which are both owner-occupied and investor owned. Repayment depends primarily upon the cash flow of the borrower as well as the value of the real estate collateral. 
 Residential line of credit loans. 
 Our residential line of credit loans are primarily revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by 1-4 residential properties. Repayment depends primarily upon the cash flow of the borrower as well as the value of the real estate collateral. 
 Multi-family residential loans. 
 Our multi-family residential loans are primarily secured by multi-family properties, such as apartments and condominium buildings. Repayment depends primarily upon the cash flow of the borrower as well as the value of the real estate collateral. 
 Commercial real estate owner-occupied loans. 
 Our commercial real estate owner-occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate owner occupied properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, production facilities, health care facilities, retail centers, restaurants, churches and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate owner-occupied loans are typically repaid through the ongoing business operations of the borrower. 
 Commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans. 
 Our commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate investment properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, health care facilities, hotels, mixed-use residential/commercial, manufactured housing communities, retail centers, multifamily properties, assisted living facilities and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans are typically repaid with the funds received from the sale or refinancing of the property or rental income from such property. 
 Consumer and other loans. 
 Consumer and other loans include loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including car, boat and other recreational vehicle loans, manufactured homes (without real estate) and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans are generally secured by vehicles and other household goods, with repayment depending primarily on the cash flow of the borrower. Other loans also include loans to states and political subdivisions in the U.S. and are repaid through tax revenues or refinancing.

 Asset quality 
 In order to operate with a sound risk profile, we focus on originating loans that we believe to be of high quality. We have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. When delinquencies in our loans exist, we rigorously monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. From time to time, we may modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions, including interest rate reduction, a term extension, principal forgiveness, payment deferral, or a combination thereof, to help a borrower with a deteriorating financial condition stay current on their loan and to avoid foreclosure. Furthermore, we are committed to collecting on all of our loans. This practice leads to higher recoveries in the long-term. 
 Nonperforming assets 
 Our nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed non-earning assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 127.3 million and 86.5 million, respectively, in nonperforming assets. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped, as well as loans that are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Accrued interest receivable written off as an adjustment to interest income amounted to 0.1 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accrued interest receivable written off as an adjustment to interest income amounted to 0.5 million and 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, we had net interest recoveries on nonperforming assets previously charged off of 0.1 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.1 million and 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 73 

Nonperforming loans HFI increased by 29.9 million to 90.8 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 60.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans primarily occurred in our 1-4 family mortgage residential real estate and construction portfolios. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 30.5 million and 21.2 million, respectively, of delinquent GNMA optional repurchase loans previously sold included on our consolidated balance sheets in loans held for sale. These are considered nonperforming assets as we do not earn any interest on the unexercised option to repurchase these loans. 
 As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, other real estate owned included 0.1 million of excess land and facilities held for sale resulting from our prior acquisitions. Other repossessed assets also included other repossessed non-real estate amounting to 2.2 million and 1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The following table provides details of our nonperforming assets, the ratio of such loans and other nonperforming assets to total assets, and certain other related information as of the dates presented:

 We have evaluated our loans HFI classified as nonperforming and believe all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for credit losses on loans HFI as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Management also continually monitors past due loans for potential credit quality deterioration. Loans not considered nonperforming include loans 30-89 days past due that continue to accrue interest amounting to 40.5 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to 47.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily occurred within our construction and commercial real estate non-owner occupied portfolios.

Allowance for credit losses 
 The allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan s amortized cost basis that we do not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan s life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan s amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as we promptly charge off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. 
 We calculate our expected credit loss using a lifetime loss rate methodology. We utilize probability-weighted forecasts, which consider multiple macroeconomic variables from Moody s that are applicable to each type of loan. See Note 1, Basis of presentation, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report that was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024 for additional information regarding our methodology.

Provision for (reversal of) credit losses on loans HFI Net (charge-offs) recoveries Average loans HFI Ratio of annualized net (charge-offs) recoveries to average loans HFI (dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2023 Commercial and industrial 8,682 (189) 1,678,832 (0.01) Construction (4,446) 10 1,594,317 Residential real estate: 1-to-4 family mortgage 310 54 1,558,477 Residential line of credit 1,973 1 507,884 Multi-family mortgage 2,352 519,554 Commercial real estate: Owner occupied 2,905 (35) 1,169,680 Non-owner occupied (784) 1,833 1,925,759 0.10 Consumer and other 5,746 (2,278) 381,474 (0.60) Total 16,738 (604) 9,335,977 (0.01) The ACL on loans HFI was 156.3 million and 150.3 million and represented 1.65 and 1.60 of loans HFI as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For further information related to the change in the ACL refer to Provision for credit losses section herein and Note 3, Loans and allowance for credit losses on loans HFI in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced net charge-offs of 0.7 million, or 0.03 of average loans HFI, compared to net charge-offs of 0.6 million, or 0.02 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we experienced net charge-offs of 1.7 million, or 0.02 of average loans HFI. Our ratio of total nonperforming loans HFI as a percentage of total loans HFI increased by 31 basis points to 0.96 as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 Management has made an effort to reduce exposure to construction lending during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The reduction in construction balances and related allowance offset some of the additional allowance needed related to growth in other loan segments. 
 We also maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments, which decreased to 6.0 million as of September 30, 2024 from 8.8 million as of December 31, 2023 due to a 6.26 or 181.3 million decrease in unfunded loan commitments during the period. Notably, there was a 215.7 million decrease in unfunded loan commitments in our construction segment, which resulted in a 2.7 million decrease in required ACL related to unfunded construction commitments. Our unfunded commitments in our construction loan category decreased as a result of management's concentrated effort to reduce commitments in specific categories judged to be inherently higher risk considering the current and projected economic conditions. The decrease in ACL related to unfunded construction commitment was primarily offset by increases in our ACL related to unfunded commercial and industrial and residential line of credit commitments. 
 Loans held for sale 
 Mortgage loans held for sale consisted of 72.6 million of residential real estate mortgage loans in the process of being sold to third-party private investors or government sponsored agencies and 30.5 million of GNMA optional repurchase loans. This compares to 46.6 million of residential real estate mortgage loans in the process of being sold to third-party private investors or government sponsored agencies and 21.2 million of GNMA optional repurchase loans as of December 31, 2023.

Deposits 
 Deposits represent the Bank s primary source of funding. We continue to focus on growing core customer deposits through our relationship driven banking philosophy, community-focused marketing programs and our treasury management services. 
 Total deposits were 10.98 billion and 10.55 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 2.23 billion and 2.22 billion, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were 8.75 billion and 8.33 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Our noninterest-bearing deposits include mortgage escrow deposits which increased to 126.9 million as of September 30, 2024 from 63.6 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was slightly offset by a migration to interest-yielding products such as interest-bearing checking deposits, which increased by 249.8 million from December 31, 2023. 
 In addition to customers seeking higher rates on noninterest-bearing deposit balances, customers also migrated from money market account balances to interest-bearing checking accounts. Money market and savings deposits decreased by 106.4 million from December 31, 2023. 
 Our deposits from municipal and governmental entities, also known as public funds, decreased by 184.6 million during the period within the interest-bearing checking category. The decrease in public funds was due to management s decision to not renew certain maturing public deposits due to rising costs of these deposits. 
 Additionally, customer time deposits decreased by 91.7 million from December 31, 2023 which was largely driven by three large depositor relationship customers shifting deposits away from the bank for higher yields; however, each of the customers still maintain a relationship with us. 
 Brokered and internet time deposits increased by 368.4 million to 519.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by an issuance of brokered deposits of 369.1 million at an average coupon of 4.15 as we took advantage of favorable relative terms available during the quarter. 
 Our deposit base may include certain deposits from related parties as disclosed within Note 14, Related party transactions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 As a result of the changing interest rate environment and the shift in our deposit composition, we have experienced an increase in our cost of interest-bearing deposits and a decrease in our total deposits. Average deposit balances by type, together with the average rates per period are reflected in the average balance sheet amounts, interest paid, and rate analysis tables included in this management s discussion and analysis under the subheading Results of operations discussion.

Other earning assets 
 Securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repurchase agreements 
 We enter into agreements with certain customers to purchase investment securities under agreements to resell at specific dates in the future. This investment deploys some of our liquidity position into an instrument that improves the return on those funds. Securities purchased under agreements to resell totaled 60.2 million and 47.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Federal Funds Sold 
 Federal funds may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity. Federal funds sold totaled 37.1 million and 35.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 AFS debt securities portfolio 
 Our investment portfolio objectives include maximizing total return after other primary objectives are achieved such as, but not limited to, providing liquidity, capital preservation, and pledging collateral for certain deposit types, various lines of credit and other borrowings. The investment objectives guide the portfolio allocation among security types, maturities, and other attributes. 
 The fair value of our AFS debt securities portfolio was 1.57 billion and 1.47 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Included in the fair value of AFS debt securities were net unrealized losses of 105.2 million and 186.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Current net unrealized losses are due to interest rate increases. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 318.5 million of AFS debt securities with a weighted average yield of 2.25 and reinvested the proceeds of the sales into AFS securities with a weighted average yield of 5.25 . The sales resulted in a loss on securities of 40.2 million. We primarily sold low yielding mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. Including the reinvestment of these proceeds into higher yielding U.S. government agency and mortgage-backed securities, we purchased 457.4 million of AFS debt securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Maturities, prepayments and calls of AFS debt securities totaled 89.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 526.4 million of AFS debt securities, resulting in a loss on securities of 56.4 million. We primarily sold fixed rate, deeply discounted mortgage bonds and low yielding municipal bonds and reinvested the proceeds into U.S. government agency AFS debt securities and a blend of fixed and floating rate securities to achieve the best accretion profile for the Bank. Including the reinvestment of these proceeds, we purchased 824.0 million of AFS debt securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Maturities, prepayments and calls of AFS debt securities totaled 224.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 76.6 million of AFS debt securities, contributing to a net loss on securities of 14.2 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased 92.9 million and 93.8 million of AFS debt securities, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, maturities, prepayments and calls of AFS debt securities totaled 33.0 million and 91.4 million, respectively.

Borrowed funds 
 Deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes. However, we may also obtain advances from the FHLB, borrow from the Federal Reserve s Discount Window, one-off borrowing programs from the Federal Reserve, purchase federal funds and engage in overnight borrowing with correspondent banks, or enter into client repurchase agreements. We also use these sources of funds as part of our asset liability management process to control our long-term interest rate risk exposure, even if it may increase our short-term cost of funds. 
 Our level of short-term borrowing can fluctuate on a daily basis depending on funding needs and the sources of funds to satisfy those needs, in addition to the overall interest rate environment and cost of public funds. 
 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased 
 We enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day. These agreements are made to provide customers with comprehensive treasury management products 
 83 

as a short-term return for their excess funds. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled 19.7 million and 19.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We also maintain lines with certain correspondent banks that provide borrowing capacity in the form of federal funds purchased. Federal funds purchased are short-term borrowings that typically mature within one to ninety days. Borrowings against these lines (i.e., federal funds purchased) totaled 89.4 million as of December 31, 2023. There were no such borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 
 FHLB short-term advances 
 As a member of the FHLB system, we may utilize advances from the FHLB in order to provide additional liquidity and funding. Under these short-term agreements, we maintain a line of credit that as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 had total borrowing capacity of 1.36 billion and 1.76 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had qualifying loans pledged as collateral securing these lines amounting to 2.53 billion and 3.01 billion, respectively. There were no FHLB advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Bank Term Funding Program 
 In March 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program to make available funding to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure they have the ability to meet the needs of their depositors following the March 2023 high-profile bank failures. The program allows for advances for up to one year secured by eligible high-quality securities at par value extended at the one-year overnight index swap rate, plus 10 basis points, as of the day the advance is made. The interest rate is fixed for the term of the advance and there are no prepayment penalties. The BTFP ceased extending new borrowings on March 11, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of 130.0 million under the BTFP at a borrowing rate of 4.85 with a maturity date of December 26, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid the 130.0 million borrowings in full. 
 Subordinated debt 
 During the year ended December 31, 2003, we formed two separate trusts which issued 9.0 million and 21.0 million of floating rate trust preferred securities as part of a pooled offering of such securities. We issued junior subordinated debentures of 9.3 million, which included proceeds of common securities which we purchased for 0.3 million, and junior subordinated debentures of 21.7 million which included proceeds of common securities of 0.7 million. The trusts were created for the sole purpose of issuing 30-year capital trust preferred securities to fund the purchase of junior subordinated debentures issued by us. Both issuances were to the trusts in exchange for the proceeds of the securities offerings, which represent the sole asset of the trusts. 
 Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we placed 100.0 million of ten year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, maturing September 1, 2030. 
 Further information related to our subordinated debt as of September 30, 2024 is detailed below:

 Other borrowings 
 Other borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets includes our finance lease liability totaling 1.3 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition, other borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets include 
 84 

guaranteed rebooked GNMA loans previously sold that have become past due over 90 days and are eligible for repurchase totaling 30.5 million and 21.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Note 5, Leases and Note 10, Fair value of financial instruments within the notes to our consolidated financial statements herein for additional information regarding our finance lease and guaranteed GNMA loans eligible for repurchase, respectively. 
 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 We are expected to maintain adequate liquidity at the Bank to meet the cash flow requirements of clients who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Our Liquidity Policy is intended to cause the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity and, therefore, enhance our ability to raise funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals and lending needs and otherwise sustain our operations. We accomplish this through management of the maturities of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We believe that our present position is adequate to meet our current and future liquidity needs. 
 We continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of our short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to optimize our net interest margin. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits. 
 As part of our liquidity management strategy, we focus on minimizing our costs of liquidity and attempt to decrease these costs by growing our noninterest-bearing and other low-cost deposits, while replacing higher cost funding sources. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates and the deposit specials we offer. Increasing interest rates generally attracts customers to higher cost interest-bearing deposit products as they seek to maximize their yield. 
 Our investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets generally have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. AFS debt securities within our investment portfolio are used to secure government, public, trust and other deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings, letters of credit and derivative instruments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had pledged securities related to these items with carrying values of 1.06 billion and 0.93 billion, respectively. 
 Additional sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, FHLB borrowings, and lines of credit. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased, reverse repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. Overnight advances obtained from the FHLB are used primarily to meet day to day liquidity needs, particularly when the cost of such borrowing compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay to attract deposits. There were no FHLB advances outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow 1.36 billion through these channels with remaining capacity of 1.36 billion. As of December 31, 2023, there was 1.76 billion available to borrow against with a remaining capacity of 1.30 billion. 
 We also maintained unsecured lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling 370.0 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These are unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit typically maturing at various times within the next twelve months. Borrowings against these lines (i.e., federal funds purchased) totaled 89.4 million as of December 31, 2023. There were no such borrowings against these lines as of September 30, 2024. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had 50.0 million available through the IntraFi network, which allows us to offer banking customers access to FDIC insurance protection on deposits through our Bank which exceed FDIC insurance limits.

 (1) Includes capacity available per internal policy in the form of brokered deposits and unsecured lines of credit. 
 (2) Amounts are shown on a fully consolidated basis and exclude deposits of affiliates that are eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Company also maintains the ability to access capital markets to meet its liquidity needs. The Company may utilize various methods to raise capital, including through the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or other securities. Specific terms and prices would be determined at the time of any such offering. In the past, the Company has utilized capital markets to generate liquidity in the form of common stock and subordinated debt primarily for the purpose of funding acquisitions. 
 The Company is a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, it must provide for its own liquidity. The Company s main source of funding is dividends declared and paid by the Bank to the Company. Statutory and regulatory limitations exist that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. Management believes that these limitations will not impact the Company s ability to meet its ongoing short-term cash obligations. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, see the Item 1. Business - Supervision and regulation, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks related to our business and Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividends, each of which is set forth in our Annual Report. 
 Due to state banking laws, the Bank may not declare dividends in any calendar year in an amount exceeding the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years, without the prior approval of the TDFI. Based upon this regulation, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 191.2 million and 218.4 million of the Bank s retained earnings were available for the payment of dividends without such prior approval. In addition, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were 9.0 million and 37.5 million in cash dividends approved by the board for payment from the Bank to the holding company. Additionally, an asset dividend of an equity security amounting to 1.7 million was paid from the Bank to the holding company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were 8.5 million and 40.5 million in cash dividends approved by the board for payment from the Bank to the holding company. None of these required approval from the TDFI. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Board approved a dividend from the Bank to the holding company to be paid in the fourth quarter for 24.0 million that also did not require approval from the TDFI. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company declared shareholder dividends of 0.17 per share, or 8.0 million and 0.51 per share, or 24.1 million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company declared shareholder dividends of 0.15 per share, or 7.1 million and 0.45 per share, or 21.3 million, respectively. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Company declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of 0.17 per share, payable on November 19, 2024, to stockholders of record as of November 5, 2024. 
 86 

Shareholders equity and capital management 
 Our total shareholders equity was 1.56 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 1.45 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was primarily attributable to an increase in retained net income, net of dividends declared and unrealized loss reclassification adjustment for loss on sale of securities included in net income of 41.7 million (net of tax benefit) from December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity as of September 30, 2024 was partially off-set by dividends declared of 24.1 million and stock repurchases of 12.7 million. Book value per common share was 33.48 as of September 30, 2024 and 31.05 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Our capital management consists of providing adequate equity to support our current and future operations. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, including the TDFI, Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must maintain. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we met all capital adequacy requirements for which we were subject. See additional discussion regarding our capital adequacy and ratios within Note 12, Minimum capital requirements in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein.

 ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity 
 Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in the normal course of lending and deposit-taking activities. Management believes that our ability to successfully respond to changes in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial results. To that end, management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure. 
 The ALCO, which is authorized by our Board of Directors, monitors our interest rate sensitivity and makes decisions relating to that process. The ALCO s goal is to structure our asset/liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital in either a rising or declining interest rate environment. Profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. 
 We monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and economic value of equity using rate shock analysis. Net interest income simulations measure the short-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest in a rigorous and explicit fashion. Our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios. EVE measures our long-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. EVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time. A decrease in EVE due to a specified rate change indicates a decline in the long-term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet. For purposes of calculating EVE, a zero percent floor is assumed on discount factors. 

87 

The following analysis depicts the estimated impact on net interest income and EVE of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels for the periods presented: 
 Percentage change in: Net interest income (1) 
 Change in interest rates September 30, December 31, (in basis points) 2024 2023 +400 8.51 8.99 +300 6.90 6.81 +200 5.03 4.65 +100 2.65 2.44 -100 (2.75) (2.86) -200 (5.74) (6.54) 
 Percentage change in: Economic value of equity (2) 
 Change in interest rates September 30, December 31, (in basis points) 2024 2023 +400 (15.5) (16.6) +300 (13.2) (13.6) +200 (8.37) (8.05) +100 (3.96) (3.29) -100 3.10 1.03 -200 5.22 (0.63) 
 (1) The percentage change represents the projected net interest income for 12 months on a flat balance sheet in a stable interest rate environment versus the projected net interest income in the various rate scenarios. 
 (2) The percentage change in this column represents our EVE in a stable interest rate environment versus EVE in the various rate scenarios. 
 The results for the net interest income simulations as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulted in an asset sensitive position. The primary influence of our asset sensitivity is the floating rate structure in many of our loans held for investment as well as the composition of our liabilities which is primarily customer deposits. Our floating-rate loan portfolio is indexed to market rates and timing of repricing of loans and deposits varies in proportion to market rate fluctuations. We actively monitor and perform stress tests on our deposit betas as part of our overall management of interest rate risk. This requires the use of various assumptions based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion. Since these correlations are based on competitive pricing in the market, we anticipate that our future results will likely be different from the scenario results presented above and such differences could be material. 
 The preceding measures assume no change in the size or asset/liability compositions of the balance sheet. Thus, the measures do not reflect the actions the ALCO may undertake in response to such changes in interest rates. The scenarios assume instantaneous movements in interest rates in increments of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. As interest rates are adjusted over a period of time, it is our strategy to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions regarding characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. Key assumptions employed in the model include asset prepayment speeds, competitive factors, the relative price sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the expected life of non-maturity deposits. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ from simulated results. 
 We may utilize derivative financial instruments as part of an ongoing effort to mitigate interest rate risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations and facilitate the needs of our customers. For more information about our derivative financial instruments, see Note 9, Derivatives in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of the end of the period covered by this Report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Company s senior management. The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 2 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 On March 21, 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors re-authorized the Company s stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company may purchase up to 100 million in shares of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. The current repurchase plan will terminate either on the date on which the maximum dollar amount is repurchased under the new repurchase plan or on January 31, 2026, whichever date occurs earlier. The repurchase plan will be conducted pursuant to a written plan and is intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 The Company did not complete any share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The dollar value of shares that may yet be repurchased under the program was 87.3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 5 OTHER INFORMATION 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of the Company s directors or executive officers , modified, or any contract, instruction, or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
