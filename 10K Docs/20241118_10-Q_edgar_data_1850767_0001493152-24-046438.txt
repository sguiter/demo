 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

. The Company has an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. The
Company anticipates operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future due to, among other things, costs related to research funding,
further development of its technology and products, and expenses related to the commercialization of its products. 

Management
believes that the Company does not have sufficient cash and current assets to support its operations through at least 12 months from
the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements and will require significant additional cash resources to continue
its planned research and development activities. 

The
Company will need additional funds for promoting new products and working capital required to support research and development activities
and generate sales from its products. There can be no assurance, however, that such financing will be available when needed, if at all,
or on favorable terms and conditions. The precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time,
and will depend on a number of factors, including the quality of product development efforts, management of working capital, and the
continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of services. 

In
order to address its capital needs, including its planned research and development activities and other expenditures, the Company is
actively pursuing additional equity financing in the form of a private investment and public equity. The Company has been in ongoing
discussions with institutional investors and other parties with respect to such possible offerings. Adequate financing opportunities
might not be available to the Company, when and if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional
financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms or if the Company fails to consummate the private placement or a public offering,
the Company will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs and product portfolio expansion,
which could adversely affect its operating results or business prospects. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there
is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding in terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing
operations, if at all. After considering the uncertainties, management determined it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.

within 30 days of first regulatory approval in the U.S. or any other major market. 

The
License may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach and in addition, we may terminate the License at any time
upon 30 days notice. 

For

The
risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero- coupon issues with a remaining
term commensurate with the expected term of the award. The Company has historically been a private company and lacks company-specific
historical and implied volatility information. Management has estimated expected volatility based on similar public companies. Expected
life of the option represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding. The estimate for dividend yield is 0 because
the Company has not historically paid, and does not intend to pay, a dividend on common stock in the foreseeable future. 

As
of September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized compensation expense related to options. of this cost is subject to time-based
conditions, and is to be recognized over a period of approximately years. The remaining of unrecognized compensation expense
relates to performance-based conditions for unvested options. These costs are expected to be recognized over the required service period
once the performance condition has occurred or becomes probable. Compensation costs related to the performance stock options are evaluated
at each reporting period and subsequently adjusted for changes in the expected outcomes of the performance conditions.

In
March 2022, the Company issued common stock warrants to a non-employee under the Incentive Plan. The common stock warrants are

financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024. In addition
to our historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans,
estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that
could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. 

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended
to be covered by the safe harbor created by those sections. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions
and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as believe, 
 expect, may, will, should, would, could, seek, 
 intend, plan, goal, project, estimate, anticipate, 
 strategy, future, likely or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or other comparable

Forward-looking
statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations
and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy

and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial
condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these
forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those
indicated in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 

the
 success, cost and timing of our clinical development of our products, including the progress of, and results from, our preclinical
 and 

clinical
 trials of StemPrintER products, our discovery programs and other potential product candidates; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our product candidates, and any related restrictions, limitations or warnings
 in the label of any of our product candidates, if approved; 

our
 ability to compete with companies currently marketing or engaged in the development of treatments for indications that our product
 candidates are designed to target; 

our
 plans to pursue research and development of other future product candidates; 

the
 potential advantages of our product candidates and those being developed; 

the
 rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our product candidates; 

the
 success of our collaborations and partnerships with third parties; 

our
 estimates regarding the potential market opportunity for our product candidates; 

our
 sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and strategy; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain arrangements for manufacture of our product candidates;

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

the
 impact of government laws and regulations; and 

our
 competitive position.

on these forward-looking statements.

Overview 

We
are a clinical stage diagnostics company dedicated to improving quality of life and outcomes for the more than 18 million people worldwide
who are diagnosed with cancer each year. Our plan is to develop and commercialize a suite of novel genomic tests that support decision
making along the entire continuum of oncology care. Our focus will be the commercialization of our proprietary genomic test, StemPrintER,
for patients with early-stage breast cancer, and we estimate this market opportunity represents more than 1.3 billion in annual revenue. 

Our
primary product candidate is StemPrintER, a 20-gene prognostic assay intended to predict the risk of distant recurrence DR in luminal (ER+/HER2-negative) breast cancer patients. The assay was developed to measure the stemness of tumors, or how
much a tumor behaves like stem cells which could indicate how likely a cancer is to recur or be resistant to standard treatments, ultimately
impacting how patients are managed by their multi-disciplinary care team. StemPrintER has been validated in several clinical cohorts
and studies, the largest of which are a consecutive series of approximately 2,400 patients from the European Institute of Oncology IEO and approximately 800 patients from the TransATAC study. In the IEO cohort, StemPrintER High Risk patients SPRS High were 1.85 times more likely to have a distant recurrence compared to Low Risk SPRS Low patients (Figure 1) and in the
TransATAC cohort, SPRS High patients were 4.27 times more likely to experience a distant recurrence compared to SPRS Low Risk patients
(Figure 2). Together, these data confirm that StemPrintER is highly prognostic for outcomes in patients with breast cancer and indicate
the potential utility of the test in the oncology clinic. 

SPRS-
StemPrintER Recurrence Score; SPRS High- StemPrintER High Risk; SPRS Low- StemPrintER Low Risk 

Beyond
our initial plans for StemPrintER, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our product portfolio. First, given the broad
applicability of tumor stemness , which has been evaluated in a multitude of different cancers, we believe the StemPrint
platform will have meaningful clinical utility beyond breast cancer. As such, we will seek to validate and commercialize StemPrint for
a variety of different tumor types. Each tumor type, where applicable, would also include ancillary testing to boost our value proposition
to physicians and their patients. In addition, we plan to offer ancillary commodity testing (e.g., hereditary genetic testing, somatic
mutation testing) that augments our proprietary assays and provides additional information and value to patients and physicians throughout
the patient care continuum. 

In
order to successfully launch StemPrintER, we anticipated needing to achieve several milestones- identifying or building a laboratory
to run the test, successfully completing technology transfer from the original laboratory, obtaining CLIA certification for performing
the test and performing additional clinical utility research. We have achieved the first milestone by partnering with a commercial laboratory,
EmeritusDx, located in Lake Forest, CA,. that will be responsible for processing, testing and reporting StemPrintER results. The work
necessary to achieve the second milestone, technology transfer, is actively underway with EmeritusDx. We believe this partnership will
also expedite achievement of the third milestone- CLIA certification-as their laboratory already has a high complexity CLIA license.
This will enable us to not only report results for clinical use but alsoseek reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services. Upon completion of these milestones, we plan to initially launch StemPrintER in the US and then expand to other markets as
we evaluate clinical need and revenue opportunity.

Financial
Operations Overview 

We
have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated revenue to date. We have never been profitable and have incurred
net losses in each year since inception. We incurred net losses of 328,174 and 598,525 for the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. We incurred net losses of 1,133,001 and 1,804,644 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 7,326,772. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from expenses incurred
in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. 

Segment
Information 

As
of September 30, 2024, we viewed our operations and managed our business as one operating segment consistent with how our chief operating
decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, makes decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. As of September
30, 2024, substantially all of our assets were located in the United States. Our headquarters and operations are located in New York,
NY and London, UK.

Research
and development 

Research
and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 31,409 and 96,352, respectively, compared
to 19,951 and 50,128, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in patent related
expenses, and laboratory work and consulting. 

General
and administrative 

General
and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 296,765 and 1,036,649, respectively,
compared to 578,574 and 1,754,494, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease
of payroll related costs as a result of decreased headcount and cost saving measures, legal fees, insurance expenses and other compliance
expenses.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

Since
our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses. Our potential products are at various
phases of development. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales for several years, if at all. Pursuant to
the demerger, Tiziana transferred 1,353,373 1,000,000) in cash in January 2022 to us. In addition, subject to the terms of the
supplemental demerger agreement, Tiziana invested 2,675,940 2,000,000) in cash in March 2022 for additional shares of the Company.
Our cash flows may fluctuate and are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors. As of September 30, 2024, our cash balance
is 46,072, which is not adequate for our current planned level of operations through at least 12 months from the issuance date of these
condensed consolidated financial statements.

Operating
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of net losses, partially offset
by prepaid expenses, an increase in accounts payable, share based compensation and accrued expenses. 

Investing
Activities 

There
were no cash flows from investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to advances
from a related party, partially offset by payments on a note payable. 

Market
Capital Expenditure Commitments 

We
have no material commitment for capital expenditures. 

17 

Funding
Requirements 

We
expect that our expenses will increase and operating losses will be generated, and we have 7,654,946 of accumulated deficit as at September
30, 2024. Based on our current plans, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our operations
and capital expenditure requirements through at least 12 months from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements.
We expect to incur substantial additional expenditures in the near term to support our acceleration of activities. We expect to incur
net losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to fund our product development and clinical operations as well as commercialization
of our product candidates, will depend on the amount and timing of cash received from planned financings. Our future capital requirements
will depend on many factors, including: 

the
 costs, timing and outcomes of clinical trials and regulatory reviews associated with our product candidates; 

the
 costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution; 

the
 costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related
 claims; 

the
 emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse marketing developments; 

the
 effect on our product development activities of actions taken by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities; 

our
 degree of success in commercializing our product candidates, if and when approved; and 

the
 number and types of future products we develop and commercialize. 

A
change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly
change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Further, our operating plans may change in the
future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity
financings, debt financings, collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We do not currently have any committed
external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your
ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect
your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include
covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital
expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution
or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams,
research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional
funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our
research, product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would
otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

Further,
our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials
and other research and development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous
risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the
amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated product development programs.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

There
have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on
our consolidated financial statements or changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

For
information on recent accounting pronouncements, see our condensed consolidated financial statements - Note 2 and the related notes found
elsewhere in this quarterly report. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

There
have been no significant changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in Part II, Item 7A Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, included our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024,
the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on the evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer has concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness described below. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. 

Management
has determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of the period ended September 30, 2024
due to a lack of accounting resources resulting in inadequate monitoring controls and other oversight procedures. Our management has
determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls were ineffective due to weaknesses in our financial closing
process, inadequate segregation of duties over authorization, review and recording of transactions, lack of accounting resources, as
well as the financial reporting of such transactions. 

19 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness 

Management
intends to remediate this item in the following manner: 

i.
Recruit appropriately skilled accounting resources (the Remediation Plan 

Accordingly,
management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness. Management has begun implementing the Remediation
Plan described herein and intends to continue working on it through the year ended December 31, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
