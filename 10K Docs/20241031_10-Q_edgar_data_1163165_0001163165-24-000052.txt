 The contingent consideration arrangement requires additional consideration to be paid to TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. up to billion CAD over a term. The contingent payments represent million for every dollar that WCS pricing exceeds per barrel during the month, subject to certain production targets being achieved. The undiscounted amount we could pay under this arrangement was up to billion USD at closing. The fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date was million and estimated by applying the income approach. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we have made payments of million USD under this arrangement, included in the "Other" line within the Financing Activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

 The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for illustration purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the transaction been completed on January 1, 2022, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results of the combined entity. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of the assets acquired from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transaction. The pro forma results include adjustments which relate primarily to DD A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to oil and gas properties. We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are properly reflected.

percent shareholding interest in APLNG. At September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance of APLNG's debt was billion under various previously entered facilities. The last principal and interest payment on these facilities is due in September 2030. See Note 7 . 
 At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately billion. 
 Port Arthur LNG (PALNG) 
 In March 2023, we acquired a percent direct equity investment in PALNG, a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately billion.

billion, compared with billion at December 31, 2023 . 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the company retired million principal amount of our Notes at maturity. 
 
 Our revolving credit facility provides a total borrowing capacity of billion with an expiration date of February 2027. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the facility is not subject to redetermination prior to its expiration date. 
 Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The facility agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The facility agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors. 
 The revolving credit facility supports our ability to issue up to billion of commercial paper. Commercial paper is generally limited to maturities of 90 days and is included in short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024, and at December 31, 2023. 
 
 We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity upon downgrade of our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit ratings were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis; therefore, the VRDBs are included in the Long-term debt line on our consolidated balance sheet.

percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing September 2024 exchange rates: 
 During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be . Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately million. 
 
 In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be million billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG. 
 We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project s continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of to years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately million. 
 
 QatarEnergy LNG Guarantees 
 We have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. These guarantees have an approximate -year term with no maximum limit. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately million. 
 
 Other Guarantees 
 We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately million, which consist primarily of guarantees of the residual value of leased office buildings and guarantees of the residual value of corporate aircraft. These guarantees have remaining terms of one to and would become payable if certain asset values are lower than guaranteed amounts at the end of the lease or contract term, business conditions decline at guaranteed entities or as a result of nonperformance of contractual terms by guaranteed parties. At September 30, 2024, there was carrying value associated with these guarantees. 
 Indemnifications 
 Over the years, we have entered into agreements to sell ownership interests in certain legal entities, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. These agreements include indemnifications for taxes and environmental liabilities. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnification obligations at September 30, 2024, was approximately million. Those related to environmental issues have terms that are generally indefinite, and the maximum amounts of future payments are generally unlimited. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. See Note 8 for additional information about environmental liabilities.

million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business. 
 In 2007, ConocoPhillips was unable to reach agreement with respect to the empresa mixta structure mandated by the Venezuelan government s Nationalization Decree. As a result, Venezuela s national oil company, Petr leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates, directly assumed control over ConocoPhillips interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project. In response to this expropriation, ConocoPhillips initiated international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the ICSID. On September 3, 2013, an ICSID arbitration tribunal ("Tribunal") held that Venezuela unlawfully expropriated ConocoPhillips significant oil investments in June 2007. On January 17, 2017, the Tribunal reconfirmed the decision that the expropriation was unlawful. In March 2019, the Tribunal unanimously ordered the government of Venezuela to pay ConocoPhillips approximately billion in compensation for the government s unlawful expropriation of the company s investments in Venezuela in 2007. On August 29, 2019, the Tribunal issued a decision rectifying the award and reducing it by approximately million. The award now stands at billion plus interest. The government of Venezuela sought annulment of the award, which automatically stayed enforcement of the award. On September 29, 2021, the ICSID annulment committee lifted the stay of enforcement of the award. The annulment proceedings are underway. 
 In 2014, ConocoPhillips filed a separate and independent arbitration under the rules of the ICC against PDVSA under the contracts that had established the Petrozuata and Hamaca projects. The ICC Tribunal issued an award in April 2018, finding that PDVSA owed ConocoPhillips approximately billion under their agreements in connection with the expropriation of the projects and other pre-expropriation fiscal measures. In August 2018, ConocoPhillips entered into a settlement with PDVSA to recover the full amount of this ICC award, plus interest through the payment period, including initial payments totaling approximately million within a period of days from the time of signing the settlement agreement. The balance of the settlement was to be paid quarterly over a period of four and a half years. Per the settlement, PDVSA recognized the ICC award as a judgment in various jurisdictions, and ConocoPhillips agreed to suspend its legal enforcement actions. ConocoPhillips sent notices of default to PDVSA on October 14 and November 12, 2019, and to date PDVSA has failed to cure its breach. As a result, ConocoPhillips has resumed legal enforcement actions. To date, ConocoPhillips has received approximately million in connection with the ICC award. ConocoPhillips has ensured that the settlement and any actions taken in enforcement thereof meet all appropriate U.S. regulatory requirements, including those related to any applicable sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela. 
 In 2016, ConocoPhillips filed a separate and independent arbitration under the rules of the ICC against PDVSA under the contracts that had established the Corocoro Project. On August 2, 2019, the ICC Tribunal awarded ConocoPhillips approximately million plus interest under the Corocoro contracts. ConocoPhillips is seeking recognition and enforcement of the award in various jurisdictions. ConocoPhillips has ensured that all the actions related to the award meet all appropriate U.S. regulatory requirements, including those related to any applicable sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela.

of the lawsuits and will vigorously defend against them. On October 17, 2022, the Fifth Circuit affirmed remand of the lead case to state court, and the subsequent request for rehearing was denied. On February 27, 2023, the Supreme Court denied a certiorari petition from the defendants regarding the Fifth Circuit ruling. Accordingly, the federal district courts have issued remands to state court. Because Plaintiffs SLCRMA theories are unprecedented, there is uncertainty about these claims (both as to scope and damages), and we continue to evaluate our exposure in these lawsuits. 
 In October 2020, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) ordered the prior owners of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease P-0166, including ConocoPhillips, to decommission the lease facilities, including two offshore platforms located near Carpinteria, California. This order was sent after the current owner of OCS Lease P-0166 relinquished the lease and abandoned the lease platforms and facilities. BSEE s order to ConocoPhillips is premised on its connection to Phillips Petroleum Company, a legacy company of ConocoPhillips, which held a historical percent interest in this lease and operated these facilities but sold its interest approximately years ago. ConocoPhillips continues to evaluate its exposure in this matter. 
 
 In July 2021, a federal securities class action was filed against Concho, certain of Concho s officers, and ConocoPhillips as Concho s successor in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. On October 21, 2021, the court issued an order appointing Utah Retirement Systems and the Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as lead plaintiffs (Lead Plaintiffs). On January 7, 2022, the Lead Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint alleging that Concho made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business and operations in violation of the federal securities laws and seeking unspecified damages, attorneys fees, costs, equitable/injunctive relief and such other relief that may be deemed appropriate. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on March 8, 2022. On June 23, 2023, the court denied defendants motion as to most defendants including Concho/ConocoPhillips. We believe the allegations in the action are without merit and are vigorously defending this litigation.

days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We may require collateral to limit the exposure to loss including letters of credit, prepayments and surety bonds, as well as master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due to us. 
 Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was million and million, respectively. For these instruments, collateral was posted at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. If our credit rating had been downgraded below investment grade at September 30, 2024, we would have been required to post million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.

percent working interest in Surmont completed in 2023. Contingent consideration consists of total payments up to approximately billion CAD over a term ending in the fourth quarter of 2028. The contingent payments represent million for every dollar that the monthly WCS average pricing exceeds per barrel. The terms include adjustments related to not achieving certain production targets. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we made payments of approximately million USD to TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. under this arrangement. These payments are included in the "Other" line within the Financing Activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The fair value of the remaining contingent consideration as of September 30, 2024, is calculated using the income approach and is largely based on the estimated commodity price outlook using a combination of external pricing service companies' and our internal price outlook (unobservable input) and a discount rate consistent with those used by principal market participants (observable input). The impact of other unobservable inputs on the fair value as of September 30, 2024, was not significant.

The change in the effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to a shift in our mix of income among taxing jurisdictions as well as the release of tax reserves and the recognition of a Malaysia tax benefit occurring in the three-month period ending September 30, 2023.

 Business Environment and Executive Overview 
 ConocoPhillips is one of the world s leading E P companies based on production and reserves, with operations and activities in 13 countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; global LNG developments; oil sands in Canada; and an inventory of global exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at September 30, 2024, we employed approximately 10,300 people worldwide and had total assets of 97 billion. 

Pending Acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation 
 In May 2024, we announced a definitive agreement (the Merger Agreement) to acquire Marathon Oil Corporation (Marathon Oil) in an all-stock transaction (the Marathon Oil acquisition), inclusive of Marathon Oil's debt of approximately 5.3 billion at June 30, 2024. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each company, Marathon Oil stockholders will receive 0.255 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each Marathon Oil share. We expect that the Marathon Oil acquisition will add high-quality, low cost of supply, development opportunities to our existing U.S. onshore portfolio and additional LNG capacity to our global LNG portfolio. On August 29, 2024, Marathon Oil announced that its stockholders had approved the transaction. We anticipate closing late in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 In May 2024, as part of our Marathon Oil acquisition announcement, we stated that we expected at least 500 million in synergies, within the first full year following the close of the transaction. We now expect to reflect synergies that significantly exceed our initial 500 million guidance. Concurrent with our Marathon Oil acquisition announcement, we detailed a plan to repurchase over 7 billion of shares in the first full year following the closing of the transaction and over 20 billion of shares in total over the first three years, based on commodity prices at the time of the announcement. Through this plan we expect to retire the equivalent amount of newly issued equity from the transaction in two to three years. Further, in conjunction with the Marathon Oil acquisition announcement, we announced a plan to dispose of approximately 2 billion of assets across the portfolio pursuant to ongoing high-grading and optimization efforts.

Management s Discussion and Analysis Table of Contents 

Overview 
 At ConocoPhillips, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile, and our view is that a successful business strategy in the E P industry must be resilient in lower price environments, while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. As such, we are unhedged, remain committed to our disciplined investment framework and continually monitor market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with geopolitical tensions and conflicts, OPEC Plus supply updates, global demand for our products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, inflation and supply chain disruptions. 
 The macro-environment of the global energy industry, including the energy transition, continues to evolve. We believe ConocoPhillips will continue to play an essential role by executing on three objectives: responsibly meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and progressing toward our net-zero operational emissions ambition. We call this our Triple Mandate, and it represents our commitment to create long-term value for our stakeholders. 
 
 Our Triple Mandate and our foundational principles guide our differential value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles. Our foundational principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance. 
 
 In the third quarter, we announced further growth to our global LNG portfolio. In July, we entered into an 18-year agreement securing regasification capacity at the Zeebrugge LNG terminal in Belgium which includes regasification services for approximately 0.75 MTPA of LNG beginning in 2027. In July, we also entered into a long-term LNG sales agreement for approximately 0.5 MTPA into Asia starting in 2027. These agreements provide additional access to both the European and Asian natural gas markets. 
 
 We continue to optimize our portfolio geared towards our returns-focused value proposition. In October, we signed an agreement to acquire additional working interests in both the Kuparuk River Unit and the Prudhoe Bay Unit in Alaska. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 3. 
 
 In October, we declared a fourth-quarter ordinary dividend of 0.78 per share, representing an increase of 34 percent which incorporates the prior VROC equivalent of 0.20 per share. We also reconfirmed our 2024 planned return of capital to shareholders of at least 9 billion. Additionally in October, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our existing share repurchase program authorization by the lesser of 20 billion or the number of shares issued in the Marathon Oil transaction. 
 
 Production was 1,917 MBOED in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 111 MBOED from the same period a year ago. After adjusting for impacts from closed acquisitions and dispositions, third-quarter 2024 production increased by 47 MBOED or three percent from the same period a year ago. 
 
 Third-quarter 2024 production resulted in 5.8 billion of cash provided by operating activities. We returned 1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and 0.9 billion through our ordinary dividend and a VROC. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaling 7.1 billion and long-term investments in debt securities of 1.0 billion. 
 
 Also in the third quarter of 2024, we re-invested 2.9 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and investments, with over half of the expenditures related to flexible, short-cycle unconventional plays in the Lower 48 segment, where our production has access to both domestic and export markets.

Management s Discussion and Analysis 
 Table of Contents 

Business Environment 
 Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related returns on and of capital to our shareholders. Dynamics that could influence world energy markets and commodity prices include, but are not limited to, global economic health, supply or demand disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest, global pandemics, military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC Plus and other major oil producing countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial, operational and ESG priorities that underpin our value proposition. 
 Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with price levels for crude oil and natural gas, which are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control. The following graph depicts the trend in average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas: 

Brent crude oil prices averaged 80.18 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of eight percent compared with 86.76 per barrel in the third quarter of 2023. WTI at Cushing crude oil prices averaged 75.10 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of nine percent compared with 82.26 per barrel in the third quarter of 2023. Oil prices were lower in the third quarter of 2024 due to slower global demand growth relative to the third quarter of 2023 and higher supplies from non-OPEC Plus countries. 
 Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged 2.15 per MMBTU in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 15 percent compared with 2.54 per MMBTU in the third quarter of 2023. Henry Hub prices decreased due to excess North American natural gas storage levels following a mild 2023-2024 winter. Lower 48 segment realized natural gas prices decreased to 0.18 per MCF in the third quarter of 2024 driven by lower regional prices related to pipeline capacity constraints. 
 Our realized bitumen price averaged 47.32 per barrel in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 18 percent compared with 57.85 per barrel in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was driven by widening WCS differentials in Canada, lower heavy oil refinery demand on the U.S. Gulf Coast and impacts associated with lower sales volumes from Surmont due to a planned turnaround at one of our central processing facilities. 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our total average realized price was 54.18 per BOE compared with 60.05 per BOE in the third quarter of 2023.

 Total Company Production 
 
 We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on a worldwide basis. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our operations were producing in the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, China, Malaysia, Qatar and Libya. 
 Total production in the third quarter of 2024 was 1,917 MBOED, an increase of 111 MBOED or six percent from the same period a year ago. Total production in the nine-month period of 2024 was 1,921 MBOED, an increase of 120 MBOED or seven percent from the same period a year ago. Production increases include: 
 New wells online in the Lower 48, Alaska, Australia, Canada, China, Libya and Norway. 
 Our Surmont acquisition, which closed in October 2023. See Note 3. 
 Production increases were partially offset by: 
 Normal field decline. 
 Planned turnaround activity across our global operations. 
 After adjusting for impacts from closed acquisitions and dispositions, third-quarter 2024 production increased by 47 MBOED or three percent from the same period a year ago. After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, production in the nine-month period of 2024 increased 55 MBOED or three percent from the same period a year ago.

 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Sales and other operating revenues 13,041 14,250 40,509 41,412 Gain (loss) on dispositions (2) 108 86 200 Purchased commodities 4,747 5,543 14,939 16,297 Production and operating expenses 2,261 1,995 6,440 5,660 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,390 2,095 6,935 6,047 Taxes other than income taxes 476 536 1,567 1,624 
 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 1,209 million in the third quarter of 2024 and decreased 903 million in the nine-month period of 2024, respectively. Decreases in the third quarter were due to lower realized prices of 865 million, partially offset by higher volumes of 404 million. Decreases in the nine-month period of 2024 were due to lower realized natural gas prices of 642 million, partially offset by higher volumes of 1,368 million. Additional decreases to revenues in both the three- and nine-month periods of 2024 resulted from the timing of sales as compared with the corresponding periods of 2023. 
 Gain (loss) on dispositions decreased 110 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 114 million in the nine-month period of 2024 primarily due to the absence of the divestiture of an equity investment in our Lower 48 segment. 
 Purchased commodities for the three- and nine-month periods of 2024 decreased 796 million and 1,358 million, respectively. The third quarter of 2024 decrease was driven by lower gas and crude prices, partially offset by higher crude volumes. The nine-month period of 2024 decrease was driven by lower gas prices, partially offset by higher crude volumes. 
 Production and operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods of 2024 increased 266 million and 780 million, respectively, due to higher lease operating expenses, transportation related costs and well work activities in our Lower 48 and Alaska segments, higher volumes primarily in our Canada and Lower 48 segments as well as higher expenses associated with the Surmont turnaround in our Canada segment. 
 
 DD A expenses for the three- and nine-month periods of 2024 increased 295 million and 888 million, respectively, mainly due to higher rates in our Lower 48 and Alaska segments and higher volumes primarily in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.

 The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. As of September 30, 2024, Alaska contributed 14 percent of our consolidated liquids production and two percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Alaska reported earnings of 267 million and 973 million in the three- and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively, compared with earnings of 448 million and 1,236 million in the three- and nine-month periods of 2023, respectively. 
 
 Earnings in the third quarter of 2024 included lower revenues resulting from lower realized prices of 68 million, lower volumes of 16 million. Decreases to earnings in the third quarter of 2024 included higher DD A expenses of 36 million due to higher rates as a result of prior year-end downward reserve revisions and higher production and operating expenses of 33 million driven by higher lease operating expenses and well work activity. The decreases to earnings were partially offset by lower taxes other than income taxes of 38 million due to lower taxes driven by increased capital expenditures. 
 
 Earnings in the nine-month period of 2024 included lower revenues resulting from lower volumes of 55 million, partially offset by higher realized prices of 80 million. Decreases to earnings in the nine-month period of 2024 included higher DD A expenses of 123 million due to higher rates as a result of year-end downward reserve revisions, higher production and operating expenses of 83 million driven by higher well work activity and lease operating expenses. The decreases to earnings were partially offset by lower taxes other than income taxes of 47 million due to lower taxes driven by increased capital expenditures. 
 
 Production 
 Average production decreased 3 MBOED and 4 MBOED in the three- and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively. Decreases to production were primarily due to normal field decline, partially offset by new wells online. 
 
 Planned Acquisition 
 In October, we signed an agreement to acquire additional working interests in both the Kuparuk River Unit and the Prudhoe Bay Unit. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 3.

 The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states, producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico and commercial operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Lower 48 reported earnings of 1,241 million and 3,881 million in the three- and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively, compared with earnings of 1,781 million and 4,863 million in the three- and nine-month periods of 2023, respectively. 
 Earnings in the third quarter of 2024 included lower revenues resulting from lower overall realized prices of 494 million, partially offset by higher volumes of 190 million. Decreases to earnings in the third quarter of 2024 included higher DD A expenses of 118 million, driven by higher volumes of 64 million and higher rates of 52 million, the absence of a gain from the divestiture of an equity investment of 100 million and higher production and operating expenses of 40 million driven by increased transportation related costs of 30 million. 
 Earnings in the nine-month period of 2024 included lower revenues resulting from lower overall realized prices of 433 million, partially offset by higher volumes of 287 million. Decreases to earnings in the nine-month period of 2024 included higher DD A expenses of 323 million, driven by higher volumes of 166 million and higher rates of 160 million, higher production and operating expenses of 235 million, driven by increased transportation related costs of 93 million and increased lease operating expenses of 74 million, and the absence of a gain from the divestiture of an equity investment of 100 million. 
 Production 
 Average production increased 64 MBOED and 38 MBOED in the three- and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively. Increases to production were primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken. 
 Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.

 Earnings in the third quarter of 2024 included lower revenues resulting from lower realized prices of 49 million, partially offset by higher volumes of 104 million driven by our increased working interest in Surmont. Additional decreases to revenues resulted from the timing of sales as compared with the corresponding period of 2023. Decreases to earnings in the third quarter of 2024 included the absence of a 92 million third-quarter 2023 tax benefit recognized upon the closing of a Canada Revenue Agency audit, higher production and operating expenses of 89 million, driven by 61 million related to our increased working interest in Surmont and 50 million in expenses associated with a third quarter planned turnaround at Surmont, and higher DD A expenses of 40 million. 
 Earnings in the nine-month period of 2024 included higher revenues resulting from higher volumes of 666 million, driven by our increased working interest in Surmont, and higher realized prices of 76 million. Decreases to earnings in the nine-month period of 2024 included higher production and operating expenses of 231 million, driven by 160 million related to our increased working interest in Surmont and 61 million in expenses associated with a third quarter planned turnaround at Surmont, higher DD A expenses of 156 million, driven by higher volumes, and the absence of a 92 million third-quarter 2023 tax benefit recognized upon the closing of a Canada Revenue Agency audit. 
 Production

 The Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, Qatar, Libya and commercial and terminalling operations in the U.K. As of September 30, 2024, our Europe, Middle East and North Africa operations contributed nine percent of our consolidated liquids production and 17 percent of our consolidated natural gas production. 
 Net Income (Loss) 
 Europe, Middle East and North Africa reported earnings of 298 million and 853 million in the three- and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively, compared with earnings of 253 million and 882 million in the three- and nine-month periods of 2023, respectively. 
 Earnings in the third quarter of 2024 included higher revenues resulting from higher volumes of 31 million, partially offset by lower realized prices of 11 million primarily impacted by lower crude prices. 
 Earnings in the nine-month period of 2024 included lower revenues resulting from lower realized prices of 72 million primarily impacted by lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher volumes of 54 million. Decreases to earnings included lower foreign exchange gains of approximately 37 million and higher DD A expenses of 34 million. 
 Consolidated Production 
 Average consolidated production increased 16 MBOED and 11 MBOED in the three- and nine-month periods of 2024, respectively. Increases to production were primarily due to new wells online and improved performance in both Norway and Libya. 
 Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline and curtailed production in Libya due to the force majeure at Es Sider terminal. Force majeure was lifted in early October. 
 Exploration Activity 
 In the nine-month period of 2024, we charged approximately 40 million before-tax as dry hole expenses primarily for two partner operated exploration wells in the Alvheim area in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the Busta suspended discovery well on license PL782S that was drilled in 2019.

 At September 30, 2024, we had total liquidity of 12.3 billion, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of 5.2 billion, short-term investments of 1.6 billion and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of 5.5 billion. In addition, we have 1.0 billion of long-term investments in debt securities. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operating activities, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the Significant Changes in Capital section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, acquisitions, dividend payments and debt obligations. 

Significant Changes in Capital 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 15.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 14.7 billion for the corresponding period of 2023. The increase is primarily due to changes in operational working capital, driven by lower Norway tax payments and deferral of certain 2024 U.S. income tax payments, alongside higher production, primarily from the Lower 48 and the Surmont 50 percent working interest acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023, partly offset by lower commodity prices and lower distributions from equity affiliates. 
 Our short-term and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. 
 The level of production volumes, as well as product and location mix, impacts our cash flows. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; impacts of a global pandemic; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively manage for these factors, production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although generally this variability has not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices. 
 To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. See the Capital Expenditures and Investments section.

Investing Activities 
 For the first nine months of 2024, we invested 8.8 billion in capital expenditures and investments. Our 2024 operating plan capital expenditures are currently expected to be approximately 11.5 billion. Our 2023 capital expenditures and investments were 11.2 billion. See the Capital Expenditures and Investments section. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we signed a purchase and sale agreement for approximately 300 million, subject to customary adjustments, to acquire additional working interests in both the Kuparuk River Unit and the Prudhoe Bay Unit in Alaska. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 3. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we invested 0.7 billion in LNG projects, including Port Arthur Liquefaction Holdings, LLC (PALNG), QatarEnergy LNG NFE(4) (NFE4) and QatarEnergy LNG NFS(3) (NFS3). 
 
 We invest in short-term and long-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns. These investments include time deposits, commercial paper and debt securities classified as available for sale. Short-term funds needed to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities less than one year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year. 
 Investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 included net purchases of 599 million of investments. We had net purchases of 205 million of short-term investments and net purchases of 394 million of long-term investments . See Note 13. 
 Financing Activities 
 We have a revolving credit facility totaling 5.5 billion with an expiration date of February 2027. The credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to 500 million or as support for our commercial paper program. With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to 5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our debt balance at September 30, 2024 was 18.3 billion compared with 18.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The current portion of debt, including future payments for finance leases, is 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, the company retired 461 million principal amount of our 2.125 Notes at maturity. Debt payments are expected to be made using current cash balances and cash provided by operating activities. 
 The current long-term debt credit ratings are: 
 
 Fitch: A with a stable outlook 
 S P: A- with a stable outlook 
 Moody's: " A2 " with a " stable " outlook 
 
 See Note 5 for additional information on debt and the revolving credit facility. 
 Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had direct bank letters of credit of 236 million and 340 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit. 
 Shelf Registration 
 We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate number of various types of debt and equity securities.

 We believe in delivering value to our shareholders through our return of capital framework. The framework is structured to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases. In connection with the pending transaction with Marathon Oil, share repurchases were restricted for a period of time pursuant to SEC regulations. These restrictions ended after the Marathon Oil stockholder approval on August 29, 2024 and share repurchases were subsequently resumed. We anticipate achieving at least 9 billion return of capital in 2024. See Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we paid ordinary dividends of 1.74 per share and VROC payments of 0.60 per share. In the first nine months of 2023, we paid ordinary dividends of 1.53 per share and VROC payments of 1.90 per share. 
 
 In October 2024, we declared an increase to our quarterly ordinary dividend from 0.58 per share to 0.78 per share, representing a 34 percent increase, effectively rolling the amount of the prior quarter VROC into the ordinary dividend. VROC remains a discretionary option in elevated price environments. The dividend is payable December 2, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 11, 2024. 
 
 In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our existing authorization of 45 billion by a total of the lesser of 20 billion or the number of shares issued in the Marathon Oil transaction, such that the Company is not to exceed 65 billion in aggregate purchases. Repurchases are made at management s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 414.2 million shares and 32.3 billion. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 30.8 million shares for a cost of 3.5 billion. 
 
 See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Contingencies 
 We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. See Note 8 . 
 Legal and Tax Matters 
 We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including, but not limited to, matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations and climate change. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. 
 Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. 
 Environmental 
 We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. For a discussion of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations, including those with associated remediation obligations, see the Environmental section in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages 56 58 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operations. As of September 30, 2024, there were 15 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. 
 For remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada, our consolidated balance sheet included a total environmental accrual of 209 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 184 million at December 31, 2023. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. 
 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations. 
 See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors "We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations," in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 8 for information on environmental litigation. 
 Climate Change 
 Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws and regulations focusing on GHG or methane emissions reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations, see the Climate Change section in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on pages 58 59 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Company Response to Climate-Related Risks 
 In 2020, we adopted a climate-related risk framework with an ambition to reduce our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions to net-zero by 2050. The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement. 
 An important component of our Climate Risk Strategy is the Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (the 'Plan'). The Plan outlines how we intend to play a valued role in the energy transition by executing on our Triple Mandate to: reliably and responsibly meet energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and progress toward our net-zero operational emissions ambition. The Plan also outlines how we intend to apply our strategic capabilities and resources to meet the challenges posed by climate change in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that balances the interests of our stakeholders. 
 Key elements of the Plan include: 
 Maintaining strategic flexibility 
 Building a resilient asset portfolio with a focus on low cost of supply and low GHG intensity to meet transition pathway energy demand. 
 Committing to capital discipline through use of a fully burdened cost of supply, including cost of carbon, as the basis for capital allocation. 
 Track the energy transition through a comprehensive scenario planning process to calibrate and understand alternative energy transition pathways and test the resilience of our corporate strategy to climate risk. 
 Reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
 Setting targets for emissions over which we have ownership and control, with an ambition to become a net-zero company for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. 
 Addressing Scope 3 (end-use) emissions 
 Advocating for a well-designed, economy-wide price on carbon and engaging in development of other policy and legislation to address end-use emissions. 
 Working with our suppliers and commercial partners to reduce emissions along the value chain. 
 Contributing to an orderly transition 
 Building an attractive LNG portfolio as an important component of responsibly meeting energy transition demand due to its lower GHG emissions than coal used for electricity generation. 
 Evaluating potential investments in emerging energy transition and low-carbon technologies. 
 Our Plan does not include a Scope 3 (end-use) emissions target. We recognize that end-use emissions must be reduced to meet global climate objectives. However, it is our view that supply-side constraints through Scope 3 targets for North American and European upstream oil and gas producers would be counterproductive to climate goals. In the absence of policy measures that address global demand, Scope 3 targets would shift production to other global operators, potentially eroding energy security and increasing emissions. This is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating for a well-designed, economy-wide price on carbon and engaged in development of other policies or legislation that could address end-use emissions from high-carbon intensity energy use. We have also expanded policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include energy efficiency, end-use emissions policy and regulatory action, such as support for the direct regulation of methane.

In support of addressing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, since 2023, we made progress in several key areas: 
 Improved our GHG target framework by accelerating our GHG emissions intensity reduction target to 50-60 percent by 2030 from a 2016 baseline for both gross operated and net equity emissions. 
 Achieved the Gold Standard Pathway for emissions reporting in the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 Initiative. 
 Continued methane emissions reductions activities in support of our near-zero methane emissions intensity (1.5 kilogram carbon dioxide equivalent per BOE) and introduced data quality improvements. 
 Remained on schedule to meet a target of zero routine flaring by the end of 2025, five years sooner than the World Bank Initiative's goal of 2030. 
 Our emissions reduction efforts and net-zero ambition are supported by our multi-disciplinary Low-Carbon Technology organization. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors "Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on GHG emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products," and "Broader investor and societal attention to and efforts to address global climate change may limit who can do business with us or our access to financial markets and could subject us to litigation," in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 8 for information on climate change litigation.

 Other than the risk factors set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Marathon Oil 
 
 Our ability to complete the Marathon Oil acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory clearances, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition not to be completed. 
 On May 28, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire Marathon Oil. The Marathon Oil acquisition is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement. These closing conditions include, among others: 
 The expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act) and certain non-U.S. antitrust approvals; and 
 The absence of any governmental order or law that makes consummation of the Marathon Oil acquisition illegal or otherwise prohibited. 
 On July 11, 2024, both ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (Second Request) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in connection with the FTC's review of the merger. Issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act until 30 days after both companies have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is terminated sooner by the FTC. 
 No assurance can be given that the regulatory clearances be obtained or that the other required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required clearances are obtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals and clearances, including whether any required conditions will materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. Any delay in completing the Marathon Oil acquisition could cause the combined company not to achieve, or to be delayed in achieving, some or all of the expected benefits and synergies from the acquisition. We can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 The termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact our business. 
 If the Marathon Oil acquisition is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the Marathon Oil acquisition, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following: 
 We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price; 
 We may experience negative reactions from our commercial and vendor partners and employees; and 
 Despite our rights to receive termination fees under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay certain costs relating to the Marathon Oil acquisition, such as financial advisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the Marathon Oil acquisition is completed, and such termination fees, if any, we receive may be insufficient to cover all such expenses. 
 
 Whether or not the Marathon Oil acquisition is completed, the pendency of the Marathon Oil acquisition could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. 
 Whether or not the Marathon Oil acquisition is completed, the pendency of the Marathon Oil acquisition could cause disruptions in our business. Specifically: 
 Our and Marathon Oil s current and prospective employees will experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect the two companies abilities to retain key managers and other employees; 
 Uncertainty regarding the completion of the Marathon Oil acquisition may cause our and Marathon Oil s commercial and vendor partners or others that deal with us or Marathon Oil to delay or defer certain business decisions or to decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Marathon Oil, which could negatively affect our respective revenues, earnings and cash flows; and

The attention of our and Marathon Oil s management may be directed toward the completion of the Marathon Oil acquisition, as well as integration planning, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to our business. 
 
 We have and will continue to divert significant management resources in an effort to complete the Marathon Oil acquisition and are subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business. If the Marathon Oil acquisition is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit. 
 
 The market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Marathon Oil acquisition. 
 If the Marathon Oil acquisition is consummated, ConocoPhillips will issue shares of ConocoPhillips common stock to former Marathon Oil stockholders. Former Marathon Oil stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of ConocoPhillips common stock that they will receive in the Marathon Oil acquisition, and ConocoPhillips stockholders may decide to reduce their investment in ConocoPhillips as a result of the changes to ConocoPhillips investment profile as a result of the Marathon Oil acquisition. Other Marathon Oil stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of ConocoPhillips common stock that they receive in the Marathon Oil acquisition. Such sales of ConocoPhillips common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for ConocoPhillips common stock. 
 
 Combining our business with Marathon Oil s may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and 
 the combined company may fail to achieve the expected benefits and synergies of the Marathon Oil acquisition, which may adversely affect the combined company s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company s common stock. 
 The success of the Marathon Oil acquisition will depend on, among other things, the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings. The combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and Marathon Oil s businesses and realizing the expected benefits and synergies of the Marathon Oil acquisition. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Marathon Oil acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 The Marathon Oil acquisition involves the combination of two companies which currently operate, and until the completion of the Marathon Oil acquisition will continue to operate, as independent public companies. There can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both companies; the loss of commercial and vendor partners; the disruption of our, Marathon Oil s or both companies ongoing businesses; inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; unexpected integration issues; higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the Marathon Oil acquisition, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. 
 An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Marathon Oil acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company. 
 In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations and technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Marathon Oil acquisition and the integration of Marathon Oil s business. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the business, may offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. If we and Marathon Oil are not able to adequately address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.

 There were no repurchases of common stock from company employees in connection with the company's broad-based employee incentive plans. 
 
 In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 32.3 billion of shares. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our existing authorization of 45 billion by a total of the lesser of 20 billion or the number of shares issued in the Marathon Oil transaction, such that the Company is not to exceed 65 billion in aggregate purchases. Repurchases are made at management s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Except as limited by applicable legal requirements, repurchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plan are held as treasury shares. In connection with the pending transaction with Marathon Oil, share repurchases were restricted for a period of time during 2024, pursuant to SEC regulations. These restrictions ended after the Marathon Oil stockholder approval on August 29, 2024, and share repurchases were subsequently resumed. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
