underperforming UK Company-owned restaurants and franchised locations closed during the first nine months of 2024. Due to indicators of potential impairment associated with the UK Company-owned and franchised restaurant closures, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of the assets related to the closing UK restaurants were not recoverable. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, we recognized impairment charges of million and million for the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the asset groups. Fair values were determined based on an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model, primarily using estimated sublease income considering market rental rates. Management judgment is involved in determining the estimated fair value and includes uncertainties that under different assumptions and circumstances could drive material changes in the fair value determination. 
 During the second and third quarters of 2024, the Company also completed the refranchising of formerly Company-owned restaurants to primarily existing franchisees, which resulted in a loss on sale of million during the nine months ended September 29, 2024. We have completed nearly all of the strategic restaurant closures in the UK market and the Company s efforts are turning towards growth opportunities and mitigating closure-related costs as we complete optimization of the portfolio.

Certain administrative and capital costs are allocated to segments based upon predetermined rates or estimated resource usage. We account for intercompany sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties and eliminate the activity in consolidation. 
 Our reportable segments are business units that provide different products or services. Separate management of each segment is required because each business unit is subject to different operational issues and strategies. No single external customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 Papa John s International, Inc. (referred to as the Company, Papa John s, Papa Johns or in the first-person notations of we, us and our operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain international markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under the trademark Papa John s. Papa Johns began operations in 1984. As of September 29, 2024, there were 5,908 Papa John s restaurants in operation, consisting of 550 Company-owned and 5,358 franchised restaurants operating in 49 countries and territories. Our revenues are derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and beverage products to the general public by Company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties, and sales of franchise and development rights. Additionally, we derive revenues from sales to franchisees of various items including food and paper products from our Domestic Quality Control Centers QC Centers ), operation of our International QC Center in the United Kingdom UK ), contributions received by Papa John s Marketing Fund PJMF which is our national marketing fund, information systems equipment, and software and related services. We believe that in addition to supporting both Company and franchised profitability and growth, these activities contribute to product quality and consistency throughout the Papa Johns system. 
 In discussions of our business, Domestic is defined as within the contiguous United States, North America includes Canada, and International includes the rest of the world other than North America. 
 
 Recent Developments and Trends 
 The Company has focused on executing strategic priorities and building a foundation for long-term success, while navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment. In this current economic cycle, consumers have become more deliberate in managing their overall ticket and are showing a preference for brands that are offering compelling value. As such, we are shifting our efforts and investments to focus on initiatives that improve our price/value perception and improve our digital and loyalty experience to increase conversion and reduce friction within the customer experience. 
 While we are making progress against our strategic initiatives in 2024, as described below, we anticipate the challenging sales trends we experienced in the third quarter to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year and into 2025. 
 North America Strategic Initiatives 
 Product innovation and marketing strategy: In the second quarter, the approved contribution rate increase to PJMF became effective, while local marketing spend remains optional. This strategy shift was intended to increase the productivity of franchisees marketing contributions by leveraging the scale that national investments deliver. Additionally, in the first half of 2024 we launched an all-new brand platform Better Get You Some that was part of our deepened commitment to, and investment in, our new marketing strategy. These investments were focused on improving audience segmentation, building consumer loyalty and driving cultural relevance. In the third quarter, we evolved our messaging and promotions to showcase our better ingredients, better pizza at appropriately-valued price points to improve our overall value perception. We believe if we maintain an appropriate balance of value offerings and premium products, it will lead to improving sales trends over time. 
 Digital and loyalty strategy: Most of our sales occur through digital channels and we are actively identifying opportunities to more quickly access information, streamline the ordering journey and improve the overall user experience. In the third quarter, we rolled out an App update that improves call to actions and navigation, elevates imagery and more prominently features loyalty rewards. 
 Domestic commissary growth strategy: Our previously-announced change in the Domestic Commissary profit model was implemented during the first quarter, with the fixed operating margin that Domestic QC Centers charge increasing to 5 paired with increased rebate opportunities for franchisees. The operating income of the North America Commissary business has also increased, reflecting benefits for both franchisees as well as the Commissary. We also continue to pursue productivity efficiencies throughout the supply chain through improved operations and supplier relationships.

International Transformation Plan 
 In December 2023, the Company announced international transformation initiatives International Transformation Plan designed to evolve our business structure to deliver an enhanced value proposition to our International customers and franchisees, ensure targeted investments and efficient resource management, and better position our largest markets, including the UK, for long-term profitable growth and brand strength. Total estimated pre-tax costs associated with the International Transformation Plan are expected to be approximately 25 million to 35 million (inclusive of the 21.7 million incurred through the third quarter of 2024), which the Company currently expects to be recognized in 2024 and 2025. See Note 9. Restructuring of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 
 During 2024, the Company has made significant progress in executing the International Transformation Plan, with specific actions around UK Optimization as follows: 
 During the second quarter, we completed the planned closure of 43 underperforming UK Company-owned restaurants and successfully refranchised 40 formerly Company-owned restaurants to existing franchisees. 
 During the third quarter, we refranchised an additional 20 formerly Company-owned restaurants to primarily existing franchisees, with only 13 Company-owned restaurants remaining in operation in the UK. We have also continued evaluating and right-sizing the UK franchise base, resulting in the closure of 11 franchised locations during the third quarter and 30 total franchised locations during the first nine months of 2024. As a result of these actions, we saw year-over-year improvement in the profitability of the UK market in the third quarter, and we continue to optimize the region through exiting leases and other contracts as well as transforming our operations to increase efficiency and effectiveness. 
 We have completed nearly all of the strategic restaurant closures in the UK market and the Company s efforts are turning towards growth opportunities and mitigating closure-related costs as we complete optimization of the portfolio. 

Global Restaurant Sales and Unit Information 
 Comparable sales represents sales for the same base of restaurants for the same fiscal periods. Comparable sales growth (decline) represents the change in year-over-year comparable sales. Global system-wide restaurant sales represents total restaurant sales for all Company-owned and franchised restaurants open during the comparable periods, and Global system-wide restaurant sales growth (decline) represents the change in global system-wide restaurant sales year-over-year. Comparable sales, Comparable sales growth (decline), Global system-wide restaurant sales and Global system-wide sales growth (decline) exclude franchisees for which we suspended corporate support. 
 Equivalent units represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given period, adjusted for restaurants opened, closed, acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis. 
 We believe Domestic Company-owned, North America franchised, and International Comparable sales growth (decline) and Global system-wide restaurant sales information is useful in analyzing our results since our franchisees pay royalties and marketing fund contributions that are based on a percentage of franchise sales. Comparable sales and Global system-wide restaurant sales results for restaurants operating outside of the United States are reported on a constant dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Franchise sales also generate commissary revenue in the United States and in certain international markets. Comparable sales growth (decline) and Global system-wide restaurant sales information is also useful for comparison to industry trends and evaluating the strength of our brand. Management believes the presentation of Global system-wide restaurant sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, provides investors with useful information regarding underlying sales trends and the impact of new unit growth without being impacted by swings in the external factor of foreign currency. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in the Company s revenues.

Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 The following table sets forth the various components of Revenues from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Increase (Decrease) (In thousands) September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 QTD YTD Revenues: Domestic Company-owned restaurant sales 168,672 177,195 518,103 532,841 (4.8) (2.8) North America franchise royalties and fees 33,831 35,041 103,937 105,824 (3.5) (1.8) North America commissary revenues 210,389 204,887 611,873 624,433 2.7 (2.0) International revenues 33,024 42,927 113,433 108,998 (23.1) 4.1 Other revenues 60,891 62,762 181,271 192,295 (3.0) (5.7) Total revenues 506,807 522,812 1,528,617 1,564,391 (3.1) (2.3) 
 The comparability of results between 2024 and 2023 is impacted by transactions that have changed the composition of restaurants in the UK during the periods presented. In the second and third quarters of 2023, the Company acquired 118 formerly franchised restaurants in the UK (the UK franchisee acquisitions ). In the second and third quarters of 2024, the Company completed the closure of 43 Company-owned restaurants in the UK and also refranchised 60 formerly Company-owned restaurants in the UK. After prior disposals of two mobile restaurants, the Company operated 13 UK Company-owned restaurants during the third quarter of 2024. These transactions impact the composition of International revenues and the results of the International segment during the periods presented. See Note 9. Restructuring of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions. 
 Total revenues decreased 16.0 million, or 3.1 , to 506.8 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and decreased 35.8 million, or 2.3 , to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to each prior year comparable period. 
 Domestic Company-owned restaurant sales decreased 8.5 million, or 4.8 , for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and decreased 14.7 million, or 2.8 , for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to each prior year comparable period. The decreases were primarily due to declines in comparable sales of 6.7 and 4.6 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, due to lower transaction volumes. The comparable sales declines were partially offset by increased equivalent units of 3.8 and 2.2 for the same respective periods. 
 North America franchise royalties and fees decreased 1.2 million, or 3.5 , for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and decreased 1.9 million, or 1.8 , for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to each prior year comparable period. The decreases are primarily due to comparable sales declines of 5.3 and 3.4 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, partially offset by growth in equivalent units and lower royalty waivers in 2024 as compared to 2023. Equivalent units increased 3.5 and 2.7 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, as compared to each prior year comparable period. 
 North America franchise restaurant sales decreased 3.9 to 720.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year comparable period. North America franchise restaurant sales decreased 2.5 to 2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the prior year comparable period. North America franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company revenues; however, our North America franchise royalties are derived from these sales. The main drivers in the lower franchise restaurant sales were the North America comparable sales declines, partially offset by equivalent unit growth noted above. 
 North America commissary revenues increased 5.5 million or 2.7 for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and decreased 12.6 million, or 2.0 for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to each prior year 
 27 

comparable period. The increase for the three months ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to higher commodity prices during the quarter, particularly cheese and chicken, partially offset by lower volumes. The decline for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was due to a combination of lower commodity prices during the first half of the year and lower volumes. North America commissary revenues during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 also benefited from the previously-disclosed increase to the fixed operating margin charged to Domestic QC Centers that took effect during the first quarter of 2024. 
 International revenues decreased 9.9 million, or 23.1 , for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and increased 4.4 million, or 4.1 for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to each prior year comparable period. As mentioned above, the UK franchisee acquisitions in 2023 and the UK restaurant closures and refranchising transactions in the second and third quarters of 2024 impacted the comparability of International revenues earned in each period. The net change in revenue related to the UK franchisee acquisitions was a decrease of approximately 9.0 million and an increase of approximately 6.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, representing sales and royalties attributable to this group of restaurants compared to prior year. Excluding the impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions, International revenues would have decreased 0.9 million and 1.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, due primarily to comparable sales declines of 2.8 and 1.8 , respectively. 
 International franchise restaurant sales increased 8.3 million to 297.6 million and decreased 15.4 million to 864.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively. As mentioned above, the UK franchisee acquisitions in 2023 and the UK refranchising transactions in the second and third quarters of 2024 impacted the comparability of International franchise restaurant sales. Excluding the impact of the UK franchisee acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations, International franchise restaurant sales would have increased 5.7 million, or 2.0 , and increased 26.6 million, or 3.1 , for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively. International franchise restaurant sales are not included in Company revenues; however, our international royalty revenue is derived from these sales. 
 Other revenues, which primarily includes our national marketing funds and online and mobile ordering business, decreased 1.9 million, or 3.0 , and decreased 11.0 million, or 5.7 , for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year comparable periods. Our results for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2023 included revenues of 4.8 million and 14.7 million, respectively, related to Preferred Marketing, our formerly wholly-owned print and promotions company which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2023. This decrease was offset during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 by a 3.5 million and 7.7 million increase in marketing fees, respectively, due primarily to a planned increase in the national marketing fund contribution percentage that went into effect during the quarter and an increased in franchised locations.

 Total costs and expenses were 441.6 million or 87.1 of total revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to 490.9 million or 93.9 of total revenues for the prior year comparable period. Total costs and expenses for the three months ended September 29, 2024 include a pre-tax gain on sale of two Domestic QC Centers of approximately 41.3 million, net of transaction costs, which was recorded within General and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, total costs and expenses were 1,401.4 million, or 91.7 of total revenues, as compared to 1,459.8 million, or 93.3 of total revenues for the prior year comparable period. The changes in total costs and expenses, as percentages of revenues, were primarily due to the following: 
 Domestic Company-owned restaurant expenses were 142.4 million, or 84.4 of related revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to expenses of 145.4 million, or 82.1 of related revenues for the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024 Domestic Company-owned restaurant expenses were 419.2 million, or 80.9 of related revenues as compared to expenses of 436.9 million, or 82.0 of related revenues for the prior year comparable period. The increase of 2.3 as a percentage of revenues during the third quarter was due mainly to higher food ingredient costs, particularly cheese and chicken. The 1.1 decrease as a percentage of revenues during the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to lower insurance expenses related to improved auto liability claims experience, lower utility costs, and lower advertising spend in the first half of the year. 
 29 

North America commissary expenses were 193.8 million, or 92.1 of related revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to 189.6 million, or 92.5 of related revenues for the prior year comparable period. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024 North America commissary expenses were 561.3 million, or 91.7 of related revenues as compared to 576.4 million, or 92.3 of related revenues for the prior year comparable period. The expense, as a percentage of related revenues, decreased 0.4 and 0.6 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, primarily due to an increase to the fixed operating margin charged to Domestic QC Centers that took effect during the first quarter of 2024 and lower commodity prices for cheese during the first half of the year . 
 International expenses were 19.0 million, or 57.5 of related revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 29.8 million, or 69.4 of related revenues for the prior year comparable period. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, International expenses were 74.4 million, or 65.6 of related revenues as compared to expenses of 67.5 million, or 62.0 of related revenues for the prior year comparable period. As mentioned above, the UK franchisee acquisitions in 2023 and the UK restaurant closures and refranchising transactions in the second and third quarters of 2024 impacted the comparability of International expenses earned in each period. International expenses increased in the first six months of 2024 when compared to the prior year comparable period as a result of the UK franchisee acquisitions, which added operating costs related to Company-owned restaurants. The Company is only operating 13 UK Company-owned restaurants beginning in the third quarter of 2024, leading to a decrease in related expenses. 
 Other expenses were 55.5 million, or 91.2 of related revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 57.6 million, or 91.8 for the prior year comparable period. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, Other expenses were 164.3 million, or 90.6 of related revenues as compared to expenses of 177.7 million, or 92.4 of related revenues for the prior year comparable period. The decrease primarily reflects 4.7 million and 14.2 million of expenses incurred for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2023 related to Preferred Marketing, our formerly wholly-owned print and promotions company, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and Administrative G A expenses were 13.6 million, or 2.7 of revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 52.2 million, or 10.0 of revenues for the prior year comparable period. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, G A expenses were 129.7 million or 8.5 of revenues compared to 154.4 million or 9.9 of revenues for the prior year comparable period. G A expenses consisted of the following:

 Depreciation and amortization expense was 17.3 million, or 3.4 of revenues for the three months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 16.4 million, or 3.1 of revenues for the prior year comparable period. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, depreciation and amortization expense was 52.5 million, or 3.4 of revenues as compared to 46.8 million, or 3.0 of revenues for the prior year comparable period. The increases of 0.9 million and 5.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, were primarily due to higher depreciation expense related to our investments in technology platforms. 
 Operating Income by Segment 
 Operating income is summarized in the following table on a reporting segment basis. Adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP measure, is also presented below. See Non-GAAP Measures for a reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. We believe this non-GAAP measure is important for comparability purposes.

 ___________________________________ 
 (a) See Non-GAAP Measures below for a detail of the adjustments in each period and for a reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. 
 Operating income was 65.2 million and 127.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, as compared to 31.9 million and 104.6 million for the prior year comparable periods, an increase of 33.4 million and 22.6 million, respectively. Adjusted operating income was 29.3 million and 110.9 million for the three and 
 31 

nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, as compared to 33.6 million and 109.7 million for the prior year comparable periods, respectively, representing a decrease of 4.3 million and increase of 1.2 million, respectively. The fluctuations in adjusted operating income in 2024 compared to 2023 were primarily due to the following: 
 Domestic Company-owned restaurants decreased 6.4 million and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024. The decreases were primarily due to lower revenues from 6.7 and 4.6 declines in comparable sales for the respective periods and higher food ingredient costs during the third quarter of 2024, specifically cheese and chicken. For the most part, these food cost increases were not passed onto customers due to our focus on value perception. These factors were partially offset by lower insurance, utility costs, and commodity costs in the first half of 2024. 
 North America franchising decreased 0.4 million and increased 0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024. The variances are primarily driven by a 3.5 and 2.7 increase in equivalent units and a decrease in comparable sales of 5.3 and 3.4 for the respective periods as well as lower royalty waivers in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 North America commissaries increased 1.6 million and 4.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, primarily due to the increase in the commissary fixed operating margin, which became effective in 2024, partially offset by anticipated franchisee rebates. 
 International increased 0.4 million and decreased 4.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024. As mentioned above, we have closed 43 of the UK Company-owned restaurants and refranchised an additional 60 restaurants under the International Transformation Plan during 2024, resulting in operations of only 13 Company-owned restaurants in the UK beginning in the third quarter of 2024. These shifts in Company-owned restaurants favorably impacted International adjusted operating income during the third quarter. The year-to-date decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by operating losses attributable to the UK Company-owned restaurants, including higher depreciation expense, during the periods where we were operating more restaurants. International adjusted operating income was also negatively impacted by comparable sales declines of 2.8 and 1.8 for the respective periods. 
 All Others, which primarily includes our online and mobile ordering business and our marketing funds, increased 0.5 million and 1.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 primarily due to prior year losses incurred by Preferred Marketing, our formerly wholly-owned print and promotions company, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Unallocated corporate expenses increased 0.9 million for three months ended September 29, 2024 and decreased 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024. The decrease during the year-to-date period was primarily due to the reversal of stock compensation expense for unvested equity compensation awards from leadership transitions incurred primarily during the first three months of 2024, which was partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to our investments in technology support initiatives.

Items Below Operating Income 
 The following table sets forth the various items below Operating income from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Increase (Decrease) (In thousands, except per share amounts) September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 QTD YTD Operating income 65,229 31,868 127,173 104,576 33,361 22,597 Net interest expense (10,629) (11,378) (32,588) (31,674) 749 (914) Income before income taxes 54,600 20,490 94,585 72,902 34,110 21,683 Income tax expense 12,812 4,539 25,347 16,546 8,273 8,801 Net income before attribution to noncontrolling interests 41,788 15,951 69,238 56,356 25,837 12,882 Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 20 (90) (551) (351) 110 (200) Net income attributable to the Company 41,808 15,861 68,687 56,005 25,947 12,682 Basic earnings per common share 1.28 0.49 2.10 1.69 0.79 0.41 Diluted earnings per common share 1.27 0.48 2.09 1.68 0.79 0.41 
 Net Interest Expense 
 Net interest expense decreased 0.7 million and increased 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended September 29, 2024 was due primarily to lower average outstanding debt during the quarter. The increase for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 was due to higher average outstanding debt during the nine months ended September 29, 2024. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) 
 Our effective income tax rate was 23.5 and 26.8 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, as compared to an income tax rate of 22.2 and 22.7 for the prior year comparable periods. The higher effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 was driven by impairment charges related to the International Restructuring that created unrecognized tax losses and prevented the Company from generating foreign tax credits as well as a tax shortfall generated by stock option exercises and vesting of restricted shares in 2024. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 Income before income taxes 54,600 20,490 94,585 72,902 Income tax expense 12,812 4,539 25,347 16,546 Effective tax rate 23.5 22.2 26.8 22.7 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Net income included losses of less than 0.1 million and income of 0.6 million attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, as compared to income of 0.1 million and 0.4 million for the prior year comparable periods. 
 Diluted Earnings Per Common Share 
 Diluted earnings per common share was 1.27 and 2.09 for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, as compared to 0.48 and 1.68 for the prior year comparable periods, representing increases of 0.79 and 0.41, respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, a non-GAAP measure, was 0.43 and 1.71 for the three 
 33 

and nine months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per common share of 0.53 and 1.80 for the prior year comparable periods, representing respective decreases of 0.10 and 0.09. See Non-GAAP Measures for additional information. 
 34 

Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per common share. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they reflect metrics that our management team and Board utilize to evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per common share are operating income, net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share, respectively. These non-GAAP measures should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company s performance than the Company s U.S. GAAP results. The table below reconciles our GAAP financial results to our non-GAAP financial measures.

 In addition, we present free cash flow in this report, which is a non-GAAP measure. Please see Liquidity and Capital Resources Free Cash Flow for a discussion of why we believe free cash flow provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations, and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. 
 36 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the PJI Revolving Facility ). Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, and returning value to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and/or share repurchases. Our capital priorities are: 
 investing for growth 
 maintaining a strong balance sheet, and 
 returning capital to shareholders 
 The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity, along with cash generated by operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements, cash dividends, interest payments and share repurchases over the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Cash Flows 
 The table below summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 55,884 126,936 Investing activities 7,448 (57,654) Financing activities (86,584) (79,139) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 215 (24) Change in cash and cash equivalents (23,037) (9,881) 
 Operating Activities 
 Total cash provided by operating activities was 55.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to 126.9 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease of 71.1 million primarily reflects lower net income after considering the gain on sale of QC Center properties as well as unfavorable working capital changes in the first nine months of 2024, principally related to the following: 
 Higher tax payments in 2024 due to higher income before income taxes, compared to lower prior year tax payments stemming from the application of 2022 overpayments towards 2023 tax payments; 
 Changes in the assets and liabilities of the advertising funds over the comparable periods related to the timing of cash receipts as compared to spending on advertising expense; and 
 Higher accrual balances at December 31, 2023 related to the 53rd week of our 2023 fiscal year, which resulted in higher cash outflows in 2024. 
 Investing Activities 
 Total cash provided by investing activities was 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to cash used in investing activities of 57.7 million for the same period in 2023. The cash generated from investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of 46.7 million from the sale of two Domestic QC Centers, lower capital expenditures and net repayments received on notes to franchisees in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to net issuances of notes to franchisees in 2023. We also received a 2.3 million investment distribution related to our deferred compensation plan during the first nine months of 2024. 
 Our capital expenditures consisted primarily of capital investments for existing restaurants and new restaurant locations as well as investments in technology platforms. We estimate that our capital expenditures during 2024 will be approximately 75 million to 85 million. This estimate includes the acquisition of sites and construction costs for new Company-owned 
 37 

restaurants that have opened or that we expect to open during 2024. We intend to fund our capital expenditures with cash generated by operations and borrowings under our PJI Revolving Facility, as necessary. 
 Financing Activities 
 Total cash used in financing activities was 86.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 compared to 79.1 million for the same period of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, the principal financing outflows were related to dividend payments of 45.4 million, net repayments of 37.2 million on the PJI Revolving Facility, 6.8 million in payments related to financing leases, and 3.5 million in tax payments on equity compensation award issuances. These outflows were offset by net borrowings of 5.7 million from the PJMF revolving line of credit (the PJMF Revolving Facility ). There were no share repurchases in the first nine months of 2024. 
 In the first nine months of 2023, cash used for financing activities primarily reflects the impact of share repurchases of 210.3 million, which were financed through 185.8 million in net borrowing from the PJI Revolving Facility. Other financing outflows in the first nine months of 2023 included 43.6 million in dividend payments, 6.3 million in tax payments on equity award issuances and 6.0 million in payments related to financing leases. 
 Debt 
 Our outstanding debt as of September 29, 2024 was 732.4 million, which was comprised of 400.0 million principal amount of our 3.875 senior notes (the Notes and 332.4 million outstanding under the PJI Revolving Facility and the PJMF Revolving Facility. Remaining availability under the PJI Revolving Facility was approximately 273.2 million as of September 29, 2024. 
 Our Credit Agreement, dated September 14, 2021 and amended May 30, 2023 (as amended, the Credit Agreement ), contains affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, require customary reporting obligations and restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, the consummation of certain mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and similar transactions, the making of investments, equity distributions and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. The Company is also subject to certain financial covenants, as shown in the following table, that could restrict or impose constraints on the liquidity of our business: 
 Permitted Ratio Actual Ratio as of September 29, 2024 Leverage ratio Not to exceed 5.25 to 1.0 3.0 to 1.0 Interest coverage ratio Not less than 2.00 to 1.0 3.2 to 1.0 
 Our leverage ratio is defined as outstanding debt divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the most recent four fiscal quarters. Our interest coverage ratio is defined as the sum of Consolidated EBITDA and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters divided by the sum of consolidated interest expense and consolidated rental expense for the most recent four fiscal quarters. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 29, 2024. 
 In addition, the Indenture governing the Notes contains customary covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; make loans and investments; sell assets; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 
 The PJMF Revolving Facility consists of a 30.0 million revolving line of credit pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement, dated September 30, 2015 and most recently amended on September 30, 2024. Debt outstanding under the PJMF Revolving Facility was approximately 5.7 million as of September 29, 2024. The PJMF operating results and the related debt outstanding do not impact the financial covenants under the Company s Credit Agreement.

Refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information. 
 Share Repurchases 
 As part of our long-term growth and capital allocation strategy, we may elect to invest in share repurchases to provide ongoing value and enhanced returns to our shareholders. On October 28, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with an indefinite duration for up to 425.0 million of the Company s common stock. As of September 29, 2024, approximately 90.2 million remained under the share repurchase authorization. 
 The following table summarizes our repurchase activity under this program for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023: 
 (In thousands, except average price per share) Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Aggregate Cost of Shares Purchased Maximum Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 90,160 September 24, 2023 90,160 (In thousands, except average price per share) Total Number of Shares Purchased (a) 
 Average Price Paid per Share Aggregate Cost of Shares Purchased (b) 
 Maximum Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 90,160 September 24, 2023 2,523 83.10 209,640 90,160 
 (a) The shares repurchased during the nine months ended September 24, 2023 included 2,176,928 shares repurchased on March 1, 2023 from certain funds affiliated with, or managed by, Starboard Value LP at a price of 82.52 per share for aggregate consideration of 179.6 million. 
 (b) Aggregate cost of shares purchased for the nine months ended September 24, 2023 excluded 2.8 million of transaction costs directly attributable to share repurchases, including a 1 excise tax incurred under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Of these costs, 2.1 million were classified as non-cash financing activities during the nine months ended September 24, 2023. 
 The Company utilizes a written trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, from time to time to facilitate the repurchase of shares of our common stock under this share repurchase program. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock either through a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or otherwise. 
 Dividends 
 The Company paid aggregate cash dividends to common stockholders of 45.4 million 1.38 per share) and 43.6 million 1.30 per share) for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, respectively. On October 29, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of 0.46 per common share (approximately 15.2 million in the aggregate), which will be paid on November 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (from the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) less the purchases of property and equipment. We view free cash flow as an important financial measure because it is one factor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company s performance than the Company s GAAP measures. 
 39 

The Company s free cash flow was as follows for the nine month periods of 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 September 24, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 55,884 126,936 Purchases of property and equipment (46,931) (50,905) Free cash flow 8,953 76,031 
 Cash Requirements 
 There have been no material changes in our cash requirements other than in the ordinary course of business since the end of 2023. Refer to Contractual Obligations presented within Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding our cash requirements. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other Company communications that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Generally, the use of words such as expect, intend, estimate, believe, anticipate, will, forecast, outlook , plan, project, or similar words identify forward-looking statements that we intend to be included within the safe harbor protections provided by the federal securities laws. Such forward-looking statements include or may relate to projections or guidance concerning business performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, earnings per share, share repurchases, the current economic environment, commodity and labor costs, currency fluctuations, profit margins, supply chain operating margin, net unit growth, unit level performance, capital expenditures, restaurant and franchise development, restaurant acquisitions, restaurant closures, labor shortages, labor cost increases, changes in management, inflation, royalty relief, franchisee support and incentives, the effectiveness of our menu innovations and other business initiatives, investments in product and digital innovation, marketing efforts and investments, liquidity, compliance with debt covenants, impairments, strategic decisions and actions, changes to our national marketing fund, changes to our commissary model, dividends, effective tax rates, regulatory changes and impacts, investments in and repositioning of the UK market, International restructuring plans, timing and costs, International consumer demand, adoption of new accounting standards, and other financial and operational measures.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on our PJI Revolving Facility and PJMF Revolving Facility. We attempt to minimize interest rate risk exposure by fixing our interest rate through the utilization of interest rate swaps, which are derivative financial instruments. Our swaps are entered into with financial institutions that participate in the PJI Revolving Facility. By using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we expose ourselves to credit risk due to the possible failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. The market risks associated with our debt obligations as of September 29, 2024 have not changed from those reported in Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 8. Debt of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt obligations and derivative instruments. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from our operations outside of the United States, which can adversely impact our revenues, net income and cash flows. Our International operations principally consist of distribution sales to franchised Papa Johns restaurants located in the UK, operation of Company-owned restaurants in the UK, and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our International franchisees. Approximately 6.5 and 7.4 of our revenues were derived from these operations for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, as compared to 8.2 and 7.0 for the prior year comparable period. 
 41 

We have not historically hedged our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of approximately 0.1 million and a favorable impact of 1.6 million on International revenues for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and a favorable impact of 2.3 million and an unfavorable impact of 0.7 million on International revenues for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2023, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of approximately 0.5 million and 1.7 million on operating income for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and an unfavorable impact of approximately 0.3 million and 0.8 million on operating income for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2023, respectively. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 In the ordinary course of business, the food and paper products we purchase, including cheese (our largest ingredient cost), are subject to seasonal fluctuations, weather, availability, demand and other factors that are beyond our control. We have pricing agreements with some of our vendors, including forward pricing agreements for a portion of our cheese purchases for our Domestic Company-owned restaurants, which are accounted for as normal purchases; however, we still remain exposed to ongoing commodity volatility, and increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have not historically entered into other financial instruments that would be accounted for as hedging instruments to manage this risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no change made in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

 Page 6 

a. Specified Investments . The Company, from time to time, shall determine the investments which the Participants may select to have the amounts in their Participant Accounts deemed invested, including without limitation, notional Company stock as described in Investment Alternatives ). The Company shall have the right to change the Investment Alternatives in its sole discretion. 
 b. Company Notional Stock . The Company may provide a Participant the right to invest some part or all of his or her Participant Account in notional Company stock (a Stock Account ). The value of such notional stock shall be the market closing price of shares of common stock of the Company traded on the NASDAQ exchange on the date of allocation, as determined in Section 8.2. Once allocated to the Participant Account, notional Company stock may not thereafter be invested in any other Investment Alternative, and shall continue to be so invested until an applicable distribution event. In the event of any change in the outstanding stock of the Company by reason of a stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or the like, the Committee may make equitable adjustments in the number of notional shares then held in a Participant's Account. 
 8.2. Selection of Investment Alternatives. 
 a. Participants, at the time a deferral election is made under this Plan, shall specify on the Election Form the Investment Alternatives in which the amounts subject to such deferral election are to be invested. Participants may elect to have all of the amount subject to a deferral election deemed invested in one Investment Alternative or in multiple Investment Alternatives. All selections of Investment Alternatives shall be in whole percentages. Except as provided in Section 8.1(b), the Investment Alternatives selected may be changed by the Participant from time to time, as authorized by the Committee. 
 b. If an Investment Alternative selection is not made at the time of a deferral election, or such selection is otherwise ineffective, affected deferrals will be credited with a rate of return equivalent to the Money Market Fund. 
 8.3. Notional Earnings on Deemed Investments. The notional earnings on a Participant's deemed investments will be credited to the Participant's Accounts as earned. If a Participant changes the Investment Alternatives in which any amount in their Participant Account is deemed invested, such change will be treated as a deemed sale of the former Investment Alternative and the notional profit or loss resulting therefrom, debited or credited to the Participant Account as of the effective date of the deemed sale. 
 9. PAYMENT OF PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTS. 
 Page 7 

9.1. Limitation on Payment of Participant Accounts. No payment may be made from any Participant Account except as provided in this Section 9. 
 9.2. Payment Upon Separation from Service. 
 a. Definition of Separation from Service . Provided that such term shall be interpreted within the meaning of regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A, the term Separation from Service means the date on which a Participant retires, dies or otherwise incurs a termination of employment with the Company provided that military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence that does not exceed six (6) months (or if longer, so long as the individual remains employed under Company policy or retains a right to reemployment with the Company under an applicable statute or by contract) shall not be treated as a Separation from Service. If the period of leave exceeds six (6) months and the individual does not remain employed under Company policy or retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following such six month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave is due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for at least six (6) continuous months, and such impairment causes the individual to be unable to perform his or her regular (or similar) employment duties, a twenty-nine (29) month period of absence is substituted for such six (6) month period. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of separation from service is intended to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the definition set forth in Code 409A. Upon a sale or other disposition of the assets of the Company to an unrelated purchaser, the Administrative Committee reserves the right, to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A to determine whether Participants providing services to the purchaser after and in connection with the purchase transaction have experienced a Separation from Service. 
 b. Form of Payment . 
 1. Lump Sum Payment . A Participant may elect to have amounts subject to a deferral election paid in a lump sum due to a Separation from Service as of (i) the end of the calendar quarter in which the Participant incurs the Separation from Service (and no later than sixty (60) days thereafter), or (ii) as of the first day of any Plan Year occurring up to five (5) years after Separation from Service. 
 Page 8 

2. Installment Payments . A Participant may elect to have amounts subject to a deferral election paid in quarterly installments for a period of five (5), ten (10) or fifteen (15) years due to a Separation from Service. A Participant may elect for the first installment to commence as of the first day of any calendar quarter occurring up to five (5) years after Separation from Service. If a Participant dies prior to receiving all of the installments to which the Participant is entitled, the remaining installments shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary.

A request for reconsideration under this Section must be filed by written notice within sixty (60) days (one-hundred and eighty (180) days in the case of a Disability claim) after receipt by the claimant of the notice of denial under Section 14.2. 
 
 14.4 Review of Appeal. Upon receipt of an appeal the Plan Administrator shall promptly take action to give due consideration to the appeal. Such consideration may include a hearing of the parties involved, if the Plan Administrator feels such a hearing is necessary. In preparing for this appeal the claimant shall be given the right to review pertinent documents and the right to submit in writing a statement of issues and comments. After consideration of the merits of the appeal the Plan Administrator shall issue a written decision which shall be binding on all parties. The decision shall specifically state its reasons and pertinent Plan provisions on which it relies and the other content requirements of Section 14.2. The Plan Administrator's decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days (forty-five (45) days in the case of a Disability claim) after the appeal is filed, except that the Plan Administrator may extend the period of time for making a determination with respect to any claim for 
 Page 13 

a period of up to sixty (60) days or forty-five (45) days in the case of a Disability claim, provided that the Plan Administrator determines that such an extension is necessary because of special circumstances and notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial sixty (60) day period or forty-five (45) days in the case of a Disability claim, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a decision. 
 14.5 Designation. The Plan Administrator may designate any other person of its choosing to make any determination otherwise required under this Section. Any person so designated shall have the same authority and discretion granted to the Plan Administrator hereunder. 
 14.6 Failure to Follow Disability Claims Procedures In the case of a claim for Disability benefits, if the Plan fails to strictly adhere to all the requirements of this claims procedure with respect to a Disability claim, the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the Plan, and shall be entitled to pursue any available remedies under ERISA Section 502(a) on the basis that the Plan has failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure that would yield a decision on the merits of the claim, except where the violation was (i) de minimis (ii) non-prejudicial (iii) attributable to good cause or matters beyond the Plan's control (iv) in the context of an ongoing good-faith exchange of information and (v) not reflective of a pattern or practice of noncompliance. The claimant may request a written explanation of the violation from the Plan, and the Plan must provide such explanation within ten (10) days, including a specific description of its basis, if any, for asserting that the violation should not cause the administrative remedies to be deemed exhausted. If a court rejects the claimant's request for immediate review on the basis that the Plan met the standards for the exception, the claim shall be considered as re-filed on appeal upon the Plan's receipt of the decision of the court. Within a reasonable time after the receipt of the decision, the Plan shall provide the claimant with notice of the resubmission. For purposes of the Plan, a Participant shall be considered to have incurred a Disability if (1) the Participant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months (ii) the Participant is, by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months, receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Company or (iii) determined to be totally disabled by the Social Security Administration.

 15.2. Amendment or Termination. The Plan may be amended, modified or terminated by the Board (or its delegate) at any time or from time to time.

 15.6. Offsets. Amounts otherwise payable under the Plan to the Participant and the Participant's Beneficiaries may be offset by amounts owed to the Company by the Participant if the debts were incurred in the ordinary course of the service relationship between the Company and the Participant, the entire offset in any year does not exceed 5,000, and the offset is taken at the same time and in the same amount as the debt would have been due and collected from the Participant. 
 Page 15

 15.9. General Limitation of Liability. Subject to applicable laws, the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect from time to time, the Plan Administrator, the Administrative Committee, each employee, officer, director, delegate, and agent of the Company, and all persons formerly serving in such capacities shall not be liable for any actions arising in connection with the exercise of their duties and responsibilities with respect to the Plan unless such liability is due to that person's own willful misconduct. 
 15.10. Code Section 409A. The Plan is intended to constitute a plan of deferred compensation that meets the requirements for the deferral of income taxation under Code Section 409A. It is intended that the provisions of the Plan comply with Code Section 409A and all provisions of the Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A.

 15.11. Governing Law. To the extent not preempted by ERISA, the Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conf1ict of law rules.
