of investment company taxable income, as defined in the Code, and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. Distributions declared prior to the filing of the previous year s tax return and paid up to twelve months after the previous tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year in determining the distributions paid in such tax year. The Company intends to make sufficient distributions to maintain its ability to be subject to be taxed as a RIC each year. The Company will be subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company distributes, in a timely manner as required by the Code, an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) of its respective net ordinary income earned for the calendar year and (2) of its respective capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in the calendar year, plus any net ordinary income or capital gain net income not distributed in previous years. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than -percent) that each such tax position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes will be included in income tax expense, if any. The Company did not record any tax provision in the current period. However, management s conclusions regarding tax positions taken may be subject to review and adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, examination by tax authorities, on-going analysis of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

 There were no significant changes in valuation approach or technique as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately held entities where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. The income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments and any other end of term fees, as applicable. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates are factors such as risk of default, interest rate risk, and changes in credit quality. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increases or decreases in the valuation multiples in isolation may result in higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively, and increases or decreases in the discount rate in isolation may result in lower or higher fair value measurement, respectively.

The unrealized appreciation or depreciation associated with unfunded portfolio company commitments is recorded in the financial statements and reflected as an adjustment to the valuation of the related security in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The par amount of the unfunded portfolio company commitments is not recognized by the Company until the commitment is funded. The credit agreements of the unfunded portfolio company commitments contain customary lending provisions which are subject to the portfolio company s achievement of certain milestones. In instances where the underlying company experiences material adverse effects that would impact the financial condition or business outlook of the company, there is relief to the Company from funding obligations for previously made commitments. Unfunded portfolio company commitments may expire without being drawn upon, and therefore, do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company.

The following table reflects distributions declared, per share that have been declared by our Board for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 : 

Distributions to the Company s stockholders are recorded on the record date as set by the Company s Board. The Company intends to make distributions to its stockholders that will be sufficient to enable the Company to qualify and maintain its status as a RIC. The Company intends to distribute approximately all of its net investment income on a quarterly basis and substantially all of its taxable income on an annual basis, except that the Company may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment. The Company has adopted a DRIP that provides for reinvestment of any distributions declared on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. The Company applies the following in implementing the DRIP. The Company uses only newly-issued shares of its common stock to implement the DRIP. The number of shares issued to a stockholder that has not elected to have its distributions in cash shall be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such participant by the net asset value per share as of the last day of the Company s fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date such distribution was declared (the Reference NAV provided that in the event a distribution is declared on the last day of a fiscal quarter, the Reference NAV shall be deemed to be the net asset value per share as of such day.

Portfolio Asset Quality 
 Our Investment Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 6 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), which takes into account factors such as the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. 

Loan Rating 
 
 Summary Description 

1 
 
 Investments that are performing at or above expectations. No issues or foreseen issues on performance, covenants, liquidity, etc. The credit is expected to be repaid or prior to maturity through available cash flow or to be refinanced. 

2 
 
 Investments that are performing substantially within our expectations, with the risks remaining neutral or favorable. All new loans are initially rated 2. The credit is expected to be repaid or prior to maturity through available cash flow or to be refinanced by a third party. 

3 
 
 Investments that are performing below our expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where we expect no loss of investment return or principal. 

4 
 
 Investments that are performing below our expectations and for which risk has increased since the original investment. Although the loan is underperforming, there is not a high likelihood of any loss of principal or interest but there may be a possibility for equity returns, one-time fees or capitalized interest (if applicable) to be implied. 

5 
 
 Investments that are performing substantially below our expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. Typically, the borrower will be in default, or the loan will have been modified to address a default or the loan may be past due. 

6 
 
 Investments that are performing poorly; it is unlikely that the enterprise or asset values currently exceed the debt and/or material reduction in enterprise value is reasonably foreseen. 

The Investment Adviser focuses on downside protection by leveraging existing rights available under the credit documents; however, for investments that are significantly underperforming, which may need to be restructured, the Investment Adviser s workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Investment Committee.

Taxation as a RIC 
 We have elected to be treated, and intend to be qualified annually thereafter, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each tax year, an amount equal to at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. 
 Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98 of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2 of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we previously did not incur any U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions.

 The Board, including a majority of the directors that are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, most recently approved the renewal of the Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement on May 10, 2024. Such approvals were made in accordance with, and on the basis of an evaluation satisfactory to the Board as required by, Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act and applicable rules and regulations thereunder, including a consideration of, among other factors, (i) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided under the agreement, (ii) the investment performance of the personnel who manage investment portfolios with objectives similar to the Company s, (iii) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives and (iv) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the agreement. 
 Administration Agreement 
 On June 29, 2021, we entered into an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement with Commonwealth Credit Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (in such capacity, the Administrator ), under which the Administrator will provide administrative services for us, including arranging office facilities for us and providing office equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services at such facilities. The Board, including a majority of the directors that are not interested persons as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, most recently approved the renewal of the Administration Agreement on May 
 49 

10, 2024. Such approvals were made in accordance with, and on the basis of an evaluation satisfactory to the Board as required by, Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act and applicable rules and regulations thereunder. 
 Co-Investment Relief 
 The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from entering into negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent an order from the SEC. On August 2, 2021, the SEC granted the Company exemptive relief (the Order that allows it to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates Affiliated Funds in a manner consistent with its investment objective, positions, policies, strategies, and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with the conditions of the Order. On August 29, 2024, the Company filed an application for an order which amends certain terms of the Order pursuant to Sections 17(d) and 57(i) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder, permitting certain joint transactions otherwise prohibited by Sections 17(d) and 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act. 
 Pursuant to the Order, the Company is permitted to co-invest with its affiliates if among other things, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Company s Independent Directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or the Company s stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s stockholders and is consistent with the Company s investment objective and strategies. In addition, to the extent that our assets are treated as plan assets under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), we will only co-invest in the same issuer with certain funds or entities managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates, so long as their and our respective investments are at the same level of such issuer s capital structure; provided, that in no event will we co-invest with any other fund or entity in contravention of the 1940 Act. 
 Distributions and Dividends 
 Distributions declared for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 17.31 million and 45.59 million, respectively. 
 
 The following table reflects cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital, if any, per share that have been declared by our Board for the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively:

We intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders in amounts sufficient to qualify as and maintain our status as a RIC. We intend to distribute approximately all of our net investment income on a quarterly basis and substantially all of our taxable income on an annual basis, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment. 
 Borrowings 
 We are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities not represented by senior securities to total borrowings, equals at least 150 after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. As a result, in addition to the foregoing 1940 Act restriction on leverage, we do not currently expect to borrow in excess of the lesser of 20 of our Aggregate Committed Capital and 130 million. We may in the future, though, determine to utilize a greater amount of leverage, including for investment purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we had 105,500 par value of outstanding borrowings and our asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings was 614 , compliant with the minimum asset coverage level of 150 generally required for a BDC by the 1940 Act.

Goldman Credit Facility 
 On August 11, 2021, Commonwealth Credit Partners BDC, Inc. (the Company ), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Goldman Credit Facility") as the borrower and Goldman Sachs Bank USA Goldman Sachs as the lender. The Goldman Credit Facility is structured as a revolving credit facility secured by the Capital Commitments of the Company s subscribed investors and certain related assets. On September 27, 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended, pursuant to which the maximum loan amount was increased to the lesser of 130 million and the Borrowing Base as defined below. 
 The Goldman Credit Facility is uncommitted and matures on the earlier of (i) the date on which either the Company or lender provide written notice of termination to the other party and (ii) the date that is 30 days prior to the last date on which the Company may issue capital drawdowns to its investors. Under the Goldman Credit Facility, the Company is permitted to borrow up to the lesser of 130 million and the Borrowing Base. The Borrowing Base is based upon the unfunded capital commitments of certain subscribed investors in the Company that have been approved by Goldman Sachs and meet certain criteria. The advance rate for such investors is currently 90 but may be subject to modification. The Goldman Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. 
 The Goldman Credit Facility bears interest at a rate of Term SOFR plus 2.82 per annum. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The following table shows our payment obligations for repayment of debt and other contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

(1) As of September 30, 2024, we had 24.5 million in unused borrowing capacity under the Goldman Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base limits. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 Commitments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into future funding commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments on revolving credit lines and delayed draw loans of 56.7 million. We maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy unfunded commitments, including cash on hand, undrawn capital commitments from our investors, and available borrowings to fund such unfunded commitments. Please refer to Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail of these unfunded commitments. 
 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On 
 51 

an on-going basis, we will evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters described below. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 While our significant accounting policies are also described in Note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we believe the following accounting policies require the most significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 The Investment Adviser values our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act. For purposes of the 1940 Act, the Board has designated the Investment Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. The Board provides oversight of the Investment Adviser s fair value determinations of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in good faith, including investments that are not publicly traded, those whose market prices are not readily available. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. 
 Given that the Company's assets are currently treated as "plan assets" under the ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, one or more independent valuation firms (each a "Valuation Agent") will be engaged to independently value the Company's investments, in consultation with the Investment Adviser. The Company's quarterly valuation procedures, which are the procedures that will be followed by such Valuation Agent to the extent the Company's assets are treated as "plan assets" under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the code, are set forth in more detail below: 
 1) Investments for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at such market quotations based on the closing price indicated from independent pricing services. 

2) Investments for which indicative prices are obtained from various pricing services and/or brokers or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process, as described below, to determine whether the quote(s) obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP. 

a) Bond quotes are obtained through independent pricing services. Internal reviews are performed by the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, to ensure that the quote obtained is representative of fair value in accordance with GAAP and if so, the quote is used. If the Valuation Agent is unable to sufficiently validate the quote(s) internally and if the investment s par value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below); and 
 b) For investments other than bonds, the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, look at the number of quotes readily available and perform the following: 
 i) Investments for which two or more quotes are received from a pricing service are valued using the mean of the mean of the bid and ask of the quotes obtained. If quotes from pricing services differ by +/- five points or if the spread between the bid and ask for a quote is greater than 10 points, the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will evaluate the reasonableness of the quote, and if the quote is determined to not be representative of fair value, the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, will use one or more of the methodologies outlined below to determine fair value; 
 ii) Investments for which one quote is received from a pricing service are validated by the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser. The personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, analyze the market quotes obtained using an array of valuation methods (further described below) to validate the fair value. For assets where a supporting analysis is prepared, the Valuation Agent will document the selection and appropriateness of the indices selected for yield comparison and a conclusion documenting how the yield comparison analysis supports the proposed mark. The quarterly portfolio company monitoring reports which detail the qualitative and quantitative performance of the portfolio company will also be included. If the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser, is unable to sufficiently validate the quote internally and if the investment s par value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, the investment is valued similarly to those assets with no readily available quotes (see (3) below). 
 52 

3) Investments for which quotations are not readily available through exchanges, pricing services, brokers, or dealers are valued through a multi-step valuation process: 

a) Each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the personnel of the Valuation Agent, in consultation with the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser; and 
 b) Preliminary valuation conclusions will then be documented and discussed with our senior management. 
 The income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments and any other end of term fees, as applicable. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates are factors such as risk of default, interest rate risk, and changes in credit quality. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. 
 For investments in revolving credit facilities and delayed draw commitments, the cost basis of the funded investments purchased is offset by any costs/netbacks received for any unfunded portion on the total balance committed. The fair value is also adjusted for the price appreciation or depreciation on the unfunded portion. As a result, the purchase of commitments not completely funded may result in a negative fair value until it is called and funded. 
 The values assigned to investments are based upon available information and do not necessarily represent amounts which might ultimately be realized, since such amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual positions are liquidated. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period and the fluctuations could be material. 
 In the event Benefit Plan Investors do not hold 25 or more of our outstanding Shares, or our Shares are listed on a national securities exchange, then (i) personnel of the Investment Adviser will undertake the roles to be performed by the personnel of the Valuation Agent, as described above and (ii) if an investment falls into category (3) above for four consecutive quarters and if the investment s par value or its fair value exceeds a certain materiality threshold, then at least once each fiscal year, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which we do not have a readily available market quotation will be reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by our Board. 
 For all valuations, the Valuation Committee of our Board, which consists solely of directors who are not interested persons of the Company, as such term is used under the 1940 Act (the Independent Directors ), will review these preliminary valuations and our Board, a majority of whom are Independent Directors, will discuss the Investment Adviser s valuations; provided, however, that to the extent our assets are treated as plan assets under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, the Valuation Agent will determine valuations using only those valuation methodologies reviewed and approved by the Valuation Committee and our Board, and our Board, absent manifest error, will accept such valuations prepared by the Valuation Agent in accordance therewith. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Discount and premium on investments purchased are accreted/amortized over the expected life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount OID and market discounts or premiums are capitalized and amortized into interest income using the effective interest method. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income. The Company may have loans in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest provision. PIK interest is accrued and recorded as income at the contractual rates, if deemed collectible. The PIK interest is added to the principal balance on the capitalization date and is generally due at maturity or when deemed by the issuer. 
 Fee Income 
 Fee income, such as structuring fees, loan monitoring, amendment, syndication, commitment, termination, and other loan fees are recognized as income when earned, either upon receipt or amortized into fee income. Upon the re-payment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan fees are recorded as fee income. 
 53 

Non-accrual 
 Investments may be placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due and/or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Accrued interest is generally reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment of the ultimate outcome. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. 
 
 A summary of our non-accrual assets as of September 30, 2024 is provided below. 
 
 Kent Water Sports Holdings, LLC. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we placed certain of our investments in Kent Water Sports Holdings, LLC, on non-accrual status, as reflected in the Schedule of Investments. As a result, under GAAP, we will not recognize interest income on such investments in Kent Water Sports Holdings, LLC for financial reporting purposes. As of September 30, 2024, the cost of these non-accrual investments in Kent Water Sports Holdings, LLC was 12,977 and the fair value of such investments was 4,024. 
 
 VardimanBlack Holdings, LLC. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we placed certain of our investments in VardimanBlack Holdings, LLC, on non-accrual status, as reflected in the Schedule of Investments. As a result, under GAAP, we will not recognize interest income on such investments in VardimanBlack Holdings, LLC for financial reporting purposes. As of September 30, 2024, the cost of these non-accrual investments in VardimanBlack Holdings, LLC was 2,908 and the fair value of such investments was 3,784. 
 Net Realized Gain or Loss and Net Change in Unrealized Gain or Loss 
 Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on the sale of investments is calculated using the specific identification method. Net change in unrealized gain or loss will reflect the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized gain or loss, when a gain or loss is realized. 
 ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to certain financial market risks, such as interest rate fluctuations. Because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in SOFR are not offset by a corresponding increase in the spread over SOFR that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, including with respect to our income incentive fee, or a decrease in the interest rate of our floating interest rate liabilities tied to SOFR. As of September 30, 2024, 100 of investments at fair value represent floating-rate investments with a reference rate floor and none of our debt investments at fair value represent fixed-rate investments. Additionally, our Goldman Credit Facility is also subject to floating interest rates and are currently paid based on floating SOFR rates. 
 The following table estimates the potential changes in net cash flow generated from interest income and expenses, should interest rates increase by 100, 200 or 300 basis points, or decrease by 100 or 200 basis points. Interest income is calculated as revenue from interest generated from our portfolio of investments held as of September 30, 2024. Interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our outstanding revolving credit facility and subscription line. For our Goldman Credit Facility, we use the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2024. Interest expense on this balance is calculated using the interest rate as of September 30, 2024, adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates, as shown below. 
 
 Assuming that the interim and unaudited Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our interest rate sensitivity as of such date, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.

Because we may borrow money to make investments, our net investment income may be dependent on the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of increasing interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which may reduce our net investment income. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
