of approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, operating
activities used cash of approximately million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The condensed consolidated
financial statements included in this report have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations
and the realization of assets and the repayment of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

shares of our common stock under the ATM Facility with aggregate net proceeds to us of million, after payment of commissions
to Ladenburg and other expenses of million. 

In the future, we may require
additional sources of capital to continue operations and to implement our strategy. If our operations do not become cash flow positive,
we may be forced to seek equity investments or debt arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such
additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, we may
be unable to adequately fund our business plans, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition. If funds are available through the issuance of equity or debt securities, the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible
into equity could dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall, and the issuance of debt securities
could impose restrictive covenants on us that could impair our ability to engage in certain business transactions. 

Discontinued Operations 

As described in the
Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company s plan to phase out TSM manufacturing meets the criteria to be
reported as discontinued operations. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are presented
separately in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and results of discontinued operations are reported as a separate component
of net loss in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, for all periods presented, resulting in changes to the
presentation of certain prior period amounts. Cash flows from discontinued operations are not reported separately in the condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows. 

 Refer
to Note 2 for additional discussion of discontinued operations. All other notes to these consolidated financial statements present the
results of continuing operations and exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented unless otherwise stated. 

and was not renewed. 

The Company concluded that, in aggregate, the termination of TSM manufacturing
met the criteria for discontinued operations. As a result, this business has been reclassified to discontinued operations in these condensed
consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. 

Assets and Liabilities of Discontinued Operations 

Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are presented separately
in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these balances consisted
of assets and liabilities of the Company s Products business. Pronode Technologies AB is expected to be merged into Neonode Technologies
AB before the end of the year, upon receipt of regulatory approval.

Forward Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, adopted pursuant to the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not purely historical may be forward-looking. For example, statements in this Quarterly
Report regarding our plans, strategy and focus areas are forward-looking statements. You can identify some forward-looking statements
by the use of words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, goal, 
 plan, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions
and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations and financial position. A
number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking
statements, including, but not limited to our history of losses since inception, our dependence on a limited number of customers, our
reliance on our customers ability to design, manufacture and sell products that incorporate our touch technology, the length of
a product development and release cycle, our and our customers reliance on component suppliers, the difficulty in verifying royalty
amounts owed to us, our ability to remain competitive in response to new technologies, our dependence on key members of our management
and development team, the costs to defend, as well as risks of losing, patents and intellectual property rights, our ability to obtain
adequate capital to fund future operations, and general economic conditions, including inflation, or other effects related to future pandemics
or epidemics, or geopolitical conflicts such as the ongoing war in Ukraine or the Gaza Strip. For a discussion of these and other factors
that could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements, please see the discussion under Risk
Factors and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and
in our publicly available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements reflect our analysis only as
of the date of this Quarterly Report. Because actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking
statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. We do not undertake responsibility
to update or revise any of these factors or to announce publicly any revision to forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. 

The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item
1 of this Quarterly Report and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K. All information in the following discussion and analysis present the results of continuing operations and exclude
amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented unless otherwise stated. 

Neonode Inc., collectively
with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this Form 10-Q as Neonode , we , us , our ,
 registrant , or Company . 

Overview 

Our company provides advanced
optical sensing solutions for touch, contactless touch, and gesture sensing. We also provide software solutions for machine perception
that feature advanced machine learning algorithms to detect and track persons and objects in video streams for cameras and other types
of imagers. We base our contactless touch, touch, and gesture sensing products and solutions using our zForce technology platform and
our machine perception solutions on our MultiSensing technology platform. We market and sell our solutions to customers in many different
markets and segments including, but not limited to, office equipment, automotive, industrial automation, medical, military and avionics. 

Licensing 

We license our zForce technology
to Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs and automotive Tier 1 suppliers who embed our technology into products that they
develop, manufacture and sell. Since 2010, our licensing customers have sold approximately 95 million devices that use our patented technology. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had 37 valid technology license agreements with global OEMs, Original Design Manufacturers ODMs and automotive Tier
1 suppliers. 

Our licensing customer base
is primarily in the automotive and printer segments. Ten of our licensing customers are currently shipping products that embed our technology.
We anticipate current customers will continue to ship products with our technology in 2024 and in future years. We also expect to expand
our customer base with a number of new customers who will be looking to ship new products incorporating our zForce and MultiSensing technologies
as they complete final product development and release cycles. We typically earn our license fees on a per unit basis when our customers
ship products using our technology, but in the future, we may use other business models as well. 

15 

Non-recurring Engineering Services 

We also offer non-recurring
engineering NRE services related to application development linked to our TSMs and our zForce and MultiSensing technology
platforms on a flat rate or hourly rate basis. 

Typically, our licensing customers
require engineering support during the development and initial manufacturing phase for their products using our technology, while our
TSM customers require hardware or software modifications to our standard products or support during the development and initial manufacturing
phases of their products using our technology. In both cases we can offer NRE services and earn NRE revenues. 

Global Conflicts 

The ongoing war in Ukraine
has impacted the global economy as the United States, the UK, the EU, and other countries have imposed broad export controls and financial
and economic sanctions against Russia (a large exporter of commodities), Belarus, and specific areas of Ukraine, and may continue to impose
additional sanctions or other measures. Russia may impose its own counteractive measures. We do not procure materials directly from Ukraine
or Russia, but the war in Ukraine may further exacerbate ongoing supply chain disruptions that are occurring across the globe. In addition,
the war in Israel and Gaza and the possible expansion of such war has created political and potential economic uncertainty in the Middle
East. While the precise effects on global economies from the Israel-Hamas war, the war in Ukraine and related sanctions remain uncertain,
there has been significant volatility in the financial markets, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and an increase in energy and
commodity prices globally. Should the wars continue or escalate, there may be various economic and security consequences including, but
not limited to, additional supply shortages of different kinds; further increases in prices of commodities; significant disruptions in
logistics infrastructure and telecommunications services; and risks relating to the unavailability of information technology systems and
infrastructure. The resulting impacts on the global economy, financial markets, inflation, interest rates, and unemployment, among others,
could adversely impact economic and financial conditions.

Revenues 

All of our sales for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were to customers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. 

Total revenues were 0.8 million and 2.5 million for the three and
nine months ended September 30 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 3.1 million for the same periods in 2023, respectively.
The decrease in total revenues of 0.2 and 21.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to
the same periods in 2023, are explained by lower license fees offset by higher non-recurring revenues. 

18 

License Fees 

Revenues from license fees were 0.7 million and 2.1 million for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 3.1 million for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 12.6 and 31.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,
as compared to the same periods in 2023, were mainly due to lower demand for our legacy customers products within printer and passenger
car touch applications offset by revenues from new licensing customers. 

Non-recurring Engineering 

Revenues from non-recurring
engineering were 107,000 and 335,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4,000 and 29,000
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Most of our non-recurring engineering revenues are related to application
development and proof-of-concept projects related to our TSMs or to our zForce and MultiSensing technology platforms. The increase of
2,575.0 and 1,055.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 was
the result of TSM licensing projects and the new MultiSensing project with a commercial vehicle OEM. 

The following tables presents
the net revenues by market and revenue stream for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Gross Margin 

Our total gross margin was
97.1 and 97.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 100.0 and 99.7 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Our cost of revenues includes
the direct cost of production of certain customer prototypes, costs of engineering personnel, engineering consultants to complete the
engineering design contracts. 

Research and Development 

Research and development R D expenses were 0.8
million and 2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 2.7 million
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. R D expenses primarily consist of personnel-related costs in
addition to external consultancy costs, such as testing, certifying and measurements, along with costs related to developing and building
new product prototypes. The R D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were in line with the same periods
in 2023. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing expenses were 0.5 million and 1.8 million for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.5 million and 1.8 million for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 6.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023 was primarily related to lower payroll and related costs offset by higher professional fees. The decrease of 2.6 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to lower payroll and related costs offset by
higher professional fees and advertising costs. 

Our sales and marketing activities
focus on OEM, ODM and Tier 1 customers who will license our technology. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses were 0.7 million and 2.7 million
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8 million and 2.5 million for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 2.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same
period in 2023 was primarily related to lower professional fees. The increase of 6.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the same period in 2023 was primarily related to payroll and related expense. 

Other Income 

Other income was 0.2 million
and 0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively compared to 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The other income for the periods was mainly related to interest income earned. 

Income Taxes 

Our effective tax rate was 1.0 and (0.2) for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to (3.4) and (2.8) and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.
The negative tax rate is due to withholding taxes from sales and the decrease is due to lower license revenue during 2024. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded a net loss
from continuing operations of 1.1 million and 4.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and
 1.1 million and 3.5 million for the same periods in 2023. 

20 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity is dependent
on many factors, including sales volume, operating profit and the efficiency of asset use and turnover. Our future liquidity will be affected
by, among other things: 

licensing of our technology; 

operating expenses; 

timing of our OEM customer product shipments; 

timing of payment for our technology licensing agreements; 

gross profit margin; and 

ability to raise additional capital, if necessary. 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had cash and cash equivalents of 17.6 million, as compared to 16.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Based on our current cash position,
and assuming currently planned expenditures and level of operations, we believe we have sufficient capital to fund operations for the
twelve-month period subsequent to the date of this Report. 

Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was 17.7
million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 16.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 

Net cash used in operating activities for combined continuing and discontinued
operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 4.4 million and was primarily the result of a net loss of 4.9 million and
approximately 0.4 million in non-cash operating expenses, comprised of stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization,
amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets and inventory impairment loss and changes in operating assets and liabilities of 28,000.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately 5.8 million and was primarily
the result of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of offering costs. 

Accounts receivable and unbilled revenues for combined continuing and
discontinued operations decreased by approximately 105,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. This was mainly due
to the timing of receipts of customer payments. 

Inventory for discontinued
operations decreased by approximately 132,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, mainly
as a result of increased sales of TSMs to customers and decreased purchases after the factory closure. 

Accounts payable, accrued payroll and employee benefits, and accrued
expenses for combined continuing and discontinued operations decreased approximately 115,000 during the nine months ended September 30,
2024 compared to December 31, 2023, due to various payroll related expenses. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities of 7.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was the result of issuance of common stock under the B. Riley
ATM Facility (as defined below). 

We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows
from operations since our inception. The Company incurred net losses for combined continuing and discontinued operations of approximately
 1.1 million and 4.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 1.3 million and 4.2
million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately 222.5 million
and 217.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, operating activities used cash of approximately
 4.4 million and 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

21 

The condensed consolidated
financial statements included herein have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations and the
realization of assets and the repayment of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Management evaluated the significance of the
Company s operating loss and negative cash flows from operations and determined that the Company s current operating plan
and sources of liquidity would be sufficient to alleviate concerns about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management
has prepared an operating plan and believes that the Company has sufficient cash to meet its obligations as they come due for a year from
the date the financial statements were issued. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1,423,441 of
our common stock under the ATM Facility with aggregate net proceeds to us of 5.8 million, after payment of commissions to Ladenburg and
other expenses of 0.2 million. 

In the future, we may require
sources of capital in addition to cash on hand and our Ladenburg ATM Facility to continue operations and to implement our strategy. If
our operations do not become cash flow positive, we may be forced to seek equity investments or debt arrangements. Historically, we have
been able to access the capital markets through sales of common stock and warrants to generate liquidity. Our management believes it could
raise capital through public or private offerings if needed to provide us with sufficient liquidity. 

No assurances can be given,
however, that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available
on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, no assurance can be given that stockholders will approve an increase in the
number of our authorized shares of common stock if needed. The issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity could
dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall, and the issuance of debt securities could impose restrictive
covenants that could impair our ability to engage in certain business transactions. 

The functional currency of
our foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency, the Swedish Krona, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won and the Taiwan Dollar.
They are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Any increase or decrease in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar compared to
the Swedish Krona, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won or Taiwan Dollar will impact our future operating results. 

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any transactions,
arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources
other than the operating leases incurred in the normal course of business. 

We have no special purpose
or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support. We do not engage in
leasing, hedging, research and development services, or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face
of the consolidated financial statements. 

Operating Leases 

Neonode Inc. now operates
solely through a virtual office in California. 

On December 1, 2020, Neonode
Technologies AB entered into a lease for 6,684 square feet of office space located at Karlav gen 100, Stockholm, Sweden. The lease
agreement has been extended and is valid through November 2024. It is extended on a yearly basis unless written notice is provided nine
months prior to the expiration date. 

On December 1, 2015, Pronode
Technologies AB entered into a lease agreement for 9,040 square feet of workshop located at Faktorv gen 17, Kungsbacka, Sweden. The
facility lease terminated on September 30, 2024 and was not renewed. 

For total rent expense for
combined continuing and discontinued operations, we recorded 127,000 and 376,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,
respectively, compared to 120,000 and 365,000, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

22 

Non-Recurring Engineering Development Costs 

On April 25, 2013, we entered
into an Analog Device Development Agreement with an effective date of December 6, 2012 (the NN1002 Agreement with Texas
Instruments TI pursuant to which TI agreed to integrate our intellectual property into an ASIC, which is used in our licensed
technology. Under the terms of the NN1002 Agreement, we agreed to pay TI 500,000 of non-recurring engineering costs at the rate of 0.25
per ASIC for each of the first 2 million ASICs sold. As of September 30, 2024, we had made no payments to TI under the NN1002 Agreement. 

At-the-Market Offering Program 

On
May 10, 2021, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the B. Riley Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities,
Inc. B. Riley Securities with respect to an at the market offering program (the B. Riley ATM Facility ),
under which we may, from time to time, in our sole discretion, issue and sell through B. Riley Securities, acting as sales agent, up to
 25 million of shares of our common stock, in any method permitted that is deemed an at the market offering as defined in
Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

On
May 29, 2024, we terminated the B. Riley Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities. 

On
June 4, 2024, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the Ladenburg Sales Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann
 Co. Inc. Ladenburg with respect to an at the market offering program (the Ladenburg ATM Facility ),
under which we may, from time to time, in our sole discretion, issue and sell through Ladenburg, acting as agent or principal, up to approximately
 10 million of shares of our common stock. 

Pursuant
to the Ladenburg Sales Agreement, we may sell the shares through Ladenburg by any method permitted that is deemed an at the market 
offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Ladenburg will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent
with its normal trading and sales practices to sell the shares from time to time, based upon instructions from us (including any price
or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions the Company may impose). We will pay Ladenburg a commission of 3.0 of the
gross sales price per Share sold under the Ladenburg Sales Agreement. 

We
are not obligated to sell any shares under the Ladenburg Sales Agreement. The offering of the shares pursuant to the Ladenburg Sales Agreement
will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the issuance and sale, through or to Ladenburg, of all of the shares of our common stock
subject to the Ladenburg Sales Agreement and (ii) termination of the Ladenburg Sales Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

Subsequent
to the filing of our Form 10-K on February 28, 2024, the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates
was approximately 26.7 million. Pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, since the aggregate market value of our outstanding
common stock held by non-affiliates was below 75.0 million at the time of such Form 10-K filing, the aggregate amount of securities that
we are permitted to offer and sell was reduced to 12,909,525, which was equal to one-third of the aggregate market value of our common
stock held by non-affiliates as of June 3, 2024. On June 4, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus, dated May 16, 2024,
to the Form S-3 (File No. 333-279252) that reflects the sale restrictions pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 and to register
for sale of up to 10,366,156 of our common stock through the Ladenburg ATM Facility. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1,423,441 shares of our common stock, respectively, under
the Ladenburg ATM Facility with aggregate net proceeds to us of 5.8 million, after payment of commissions to Ladenburg and other expenses
of 0.2 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold an aggregate of zero and 903,716 shares of our common
stock, respectively, under the B. Riley ATM Facility with aggregate net proceeds to us of 7,9 million, after payment of commissions to
B. Riley Securities and other expenses of 0.2 million.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our contracts with customers
may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer, particularly when one of our customers contracts with us
for a product and related engineering services fees for customizing that product for our customer. Determining whether products and services
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. Judgment may
also be required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation identified, although we generally
structure our contracts such that performance obligations and pricing for each performance obligation are specifically addressed. We currently
have no outstanding contracts with multiple performance obligations; however, we recently negotiated a contract that may include multiple
performance obligations in the future. 

Judgment is also required
to determine when control of products passes from us to our distributors, as well as the amounts of product that may be returned to us.
Our products are sold with a right of return, and we may provide other credits or incentives to our customers, which could result in variability
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. At the end of each reporting period, we use product returns history and additional
information that becomes available to estimate returns and credits. We do not recognize revenue if it is probable that a significant reversal
of any incremental revenue would occur. 

Finally, judgment is required
to determine the amount of unbilled license fees at the end of each reporting period. 

See Note 3 Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1) for further
discussion of critical accounting policies and discussion of estimates. 

There have been no other changes
from the critical accounting policies as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023. 

Patent Assignment 

On May 6, 2019, the Company
assigned a portfolio of patents to Aequitas Technologies LLC Aequitas ), an unrelated third party. The assignment provides
the Company the right to share the potential net proceeds generated from possible licensing and monetization program that Aequitas may
enter into. Under the terms of the assignment, net proceeds mean gross proceeds less out of pocket expenses and legal fees paid by Aequitas.
The Company s share would also be net of the Company s own fees and expenses, including a brokerage fee payable by the Company
in connection with the original assignment to Aequitas. 

As reflected in publicly available court filings, on June 8, 2020,
Neonode Smartphone LLC, an unrelated third party that is a subsidiary of Aequitas Aequitas Sub ), filed complaints against
Apple Inc. Apple (assigned docket number 6:20-cv-00505-ADA), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Samsung Electronics
America, Inc. (collectively, Samsung (assigned docket number 6:20-cv -00507-ADA; see also 6:23-cv-00204-ADA), in the Western
District of Texas alleging infringement of two patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,095,879 and 8,812,993. 

U.S. Patent No. 8,095,879 

In November 2020, Samsung
and Apple filed a petition for inter partes review of certain challenged claims in U.S. Patent No. 8,095,879, assigned proceeding number
IPR2021-00144. As reflected in publicly available records, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB denied the petition in June 2021. Apple and Samsung filed a request for rehearing, which was ultimately granted on December 3, 2021, and
inter partes review was instituted. The court case against Apple was subsequently transferred to the Northern District of California in
November 2021 and assigned docket number 3:21-cv-08872, which was subsequently stayed pending the PTAB s decision. The case against
Samsung in the Western District of Texas was likewise stayed pending PTAB ruling. 

Meanwhile, in June 2021, Google
LLC Google filed a separate petition with the PTAB seeking inter partes review of certain challenged claims in U.S. Patent
No. 8,095,879, assigned proceeding number IPR2021-01041. As reflected in publicly available records, the PTAB granted the petition in
January 2022 

The PTAB found in favor of
Aequitas Sub and against Apple and Samsung in December 2022 in connection with the inter partes review proceedings, ruling that none of
the challenged claims were unpatentable. The PTAB similarly held in favor of Aequitas Sub and against Google in January 2023. Apple and
Samsung appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the Federal Circuit in February 2023 (assigned
docket number 23-1464, and Google filed its appeal in the Federal Circuit in March 2023 (assigned docket number 23-1638. On July 18, 2024,
the Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB s rulings, found in favor of Aequitas Sub and against Google and Apple/Samsung, and held that
none of the challenged claims in U.S. Patent No. 8,095,879 are unpatentable. 

As reflected in publicly
available court records, on July 14, 2023, the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas entered its final claim
constructions in the Samsung case, and based on those claim constructions, entered judgment in favor of Samsung and against Aequitas
Sub. Aequitas Sub filed an appeal with the Federal Circuit in August 2023 (assigned docket number 23-2304), and oral argument was held
on June 6, 2024 As reflected on the public court docket, on August 20, 2024, the Federal Circuit issued its written opinion, reversing
and remanding the case to the Western District of Texas for further proceedings. Specifically, the Federal Circuit held that claim 1
of the 879 patent was not indefinite. Mandate issued returning the case to the Western District of Texas on September 26, 2024. 

24 

The case against Apple remains
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The stay has not yet been lifted, and on October
17, 2024, the parties indicated that they will soon jointly request that the California case continue to be stayed until resolution of
the Samsung case pending in the Western District of Texas (case number 20-cv-00507-ADA). 

U.S. Patent No. 8,812,993 

Based on information in public records, in November
2020, Samsung and Apple collectively sought inter partes review of certain claims in U.S. Patent No. 8,812,993 (assigned proceeding number
IPR2021-00145). In June 2022, the PTAB invalidated U.S. Patent No. 8,812,993, which Aequitas Sub appealed to the Federal Circuit in August
2022 (assigned docket number 22-2134). The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB s decision on June 11, 2024.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management,
including our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that
evaluation, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024 due to a material weakness in our internal control over financing
reporting described below. 

Material Weakness 

We identified a material weakness
in the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting in the Control Activities component of the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) framework related to a lack of information technology general controls to prevent the risk
of management override. Specifically, we identified system limitations that do not facilitate proper segregation of duties within multiple
systems and a lack of mitigating business process level controls to address the risk of management override of controls over the preparation
and review of manual journal entries and in key accounting processes. 

While this deficiency did
not result in any material misstatements of our consolidated interim or annual financial statements, it does represent a material weakness
in our internal control over financial reporting. 

Remediation Efforts to Address the Material
Weakness 

We are committed to maintaining
a strong internal control environment and will implement corrective actions to support the remediation of the material weakness noted
above. This includes, but is not limited to, providing training to process and control owners, enhancing relevant policies, procedures,
guidelines and documentation templates, implementing new controls and improving documentation supporting existing controls, and enhancing
segregation of duties. 

We will not be able to fully
remediate this material weakness until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and we have concluded, through
testing, that the newly implemented and enhanced controls are operating effectively. Our management will continue to monitor the effectiveness
of our remediation plans in future periods and will make changes we determine to be appropriate. 

In designing and evaluating
disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required
to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the identification of the material weakness described above,
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 and in connection with the identification of the material
weakness discussed above, we are taking the remediation steps outlined herein to improve our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not a party to any
pending legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary
course of business, including, but not limited to, employee, customer and vendor disputes. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Except as described herein, there have been no material changes from
the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

We have identified a material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting which may, if not effectively remediated, result in additional material misstatements in
our financial statements. 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. As disclosed in Controls and Procedures in Part I, Item 4 of this Report, management identified a
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to insufficient segregation of duties and the lack of information
technology general controls to prevent the risk of management override, which we are currently working to remediate. 

A material weakness is defined
as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result
of the material weakness, our management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Our management is actively engaged in developing a remediation plan
designed to address this material weakness. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Company s internal control are discovered or occur in the future, the Company s
financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate its financial results.
