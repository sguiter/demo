 single customer re presented more than 10 of the Company's receivables. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company attempts to minimize this exposure by entering into contracts with counterparties that are believed to be of high credit quality. Collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk is usually not obtained. The credit standing of counterparties is regularly monitored. INTEREST RATE RISK The Company is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents, bank indebtedness, revolving credit facility, term loan and long-term debt. The Company s objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. The Company may manage this interest rate exposure through the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, whereby it agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. COST RISK Cash flow hedges: The Company is exposed to price volatility for raw materials and energy used in its manufacturing process. The Company manages its exposure to cost risk primarily through the use of supplier contracts. The Company purchases natural gas at the prevailing market price at the time of delivery. To reduce the impact on cash flow and earnings due to pricing volatility, the Company may utilize derivatives to fix the price of forecasted natural gas purchases. The changes in the fair value on qualifying instruments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent effective, and reclassified into Cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Current contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted purchases of natural gas over the next months. The natural gas derivative contracts were effective as of September 30, 2024.

 . Such derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value on qualifying instruments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent effective, and reclassified into Sales or Cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The foreign exchange derivative contracts were effective as of September 30, 2024. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures establish a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. Level 1	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2	Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3	Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 (a) Fair values of the Company s derivatives are classified under Level 2 (inputs that are observable; directly or indirectly) as it is measured as follows: 

 -	For currency derivatives: Foreign currency forward and option contracts are valued using standard valuation models. Interest rates, forward market rates and volatility are used as inputs for such valuation techniques. -	For natural gas contracts: Fair value is measured using the discounted difference between contractual rates and quoted market future rates. (b) Fair value of the Company s long-term debt is measured by comparison to market prices of its debt. The Company s long-term debt is not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt due within one year is million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

 (c) The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt is million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

 (d) The Company estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration by using a model based on the assumptions that a settlement would be reached and that a certain percentage of the deposits would be recovered after a certain period, which requires management s estimates. 

Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, receivables from related party, bank indebtedness, trade and other payables and payables to related party approximate their fair values.

 million, consisting of million of current income tax expense and a deferred income tax expense of million. This compares to an income tax expense of million in the third quarter of 2023, consisting of million of current income tax expense and a deferred income tax expense of million. The Company made payments, net of income tax refunds, of million during the third quarter of 2024. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was compared to - for the third quarter of 2023. In each interim quarter the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate and, if the estimated annual tax rate changes, makes a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was unfavorably impacted by such a cumulative adjustment. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was also unfavorably impacted by such a cumulative adjustment, mainly due to a change in the mix of earnings or loss between jurisdictions, the inclusion of a full valuation allowance on deferred interest expenses, certain losses with no corresponding tax benefit, and additional U.S. taxes from the sale of Canadian mills. For the first nine months of 2024, the Company s income tax expense was million, consisting of a current income tax expense of million and a deferred income tax expense of million. This compares to an income tax benefit of million in the first nine months of 2023, consisting of a current income tax expense of million and a deferred income tax benefit of million. The Company received refunds, net of income tax payments, of million during the first nine months of 2024. The effective tax rate was - compared to an effective tax rate of in the first nine months of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was unfavorably impacted by interest expense with no tax benefit, foreign exchange items, and additional U.S. tax expense on foreign operations. This was partially offset by additional research and experimentation tax credits. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was impacted by the reversal of the valuation allowance on tax loss carryforwards due to management s assessment that the future income would be sufficient to utilize the losses prior to expiration. This was partly offset by the inclusion of a full valuation allowance on deferred interest expenses, certain losses with no corresponding tax benefit, U.S. taxes from the sale of Canadian mills, and transaction costs with minimal tax benefit. In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting which agreed to a two-pillar framework to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy and profit shifting. In December 2021, the OECD published the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules ("GloBE Rules") designed to ensure that multinational enterprises are subject to tax at an effective minimum tax rate of in each jurisdiction where they operate. The GloBE Rules have been enacted or are in the process of being enacted into the domestic law of the majority of countries wherein the Company operates. For the first nine months of 2024, the GloBE Rules did not impact the Company s financial results. The Company continues to evaluate their impact on future periods.

 million and million recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily related to environmental remediation related to closed sites. The amount of these liabilities represents management s estimate of the ultimate settlement based on an assessment of relevant factors and assumptions and could be affected by changes in facts or assumptions not currently known to management for which the outcome cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The Company also has asset retirement obligations of million recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily consisting of liabilities associated with landfills, sludge basins and the dismantling of retired assets. These liabilities are included in Trade and other payables and Other liabilities and deferred credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the Company has asset retirement obligations with indeterminate settlement dates. The fair value of these liabilities cannot be estimated due to the lack of sufficient information to estimate the settlement dates of the obligation. The Company will recognize liability in the period in which sufficient information becomes available. These asset retirement obligations relate mainly to disposal of potentially hazardous materials that may be required if the Company undergoes major maintenance, renovation or demolition, and to closure of retention ponds that may be required if it ceases its operations. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and/or various state agencies have notified the Company that it may be a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund , and similar state laws with respect to other hazardous waste sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against the Company. The Company continues to take remedial action under its Care and Control Program at its former wood preserving sites, and at a number of operating sites, due to possible soil, sediment or groundwater contamination. CONTINGENCIES In the normal course of operations, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions mostly related to contract disputes, patent infringements, environmental and product warranty claims, and labor issues. While the final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at September 30, 2024, cannot be predicted with certainty, it is management s opinion that their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. INDEMNIFICATIONS In the normal course of business, the Company offers indemnifications relating to the sale of its businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, compliance with laws, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in the sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At September 30, 2024 , the Company is unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded a significant expense in the past.

DOMTAR CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 (IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED) (UNAUDITED) NOTE 13 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED) 

 t recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as it does not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications. CLIMATE CHANGE AND AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS Various national and local laws and regulations relating to climate change have been established or are emerging in jurisdictions where the Company currently has, or may have in the future, manufacturing facilities or investments. In 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy ACE rule. The ACE rule was legally challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Court vacated the ACE rule and, the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, but the court stayed its mandate as to the Clean Power Plan repeal to avoid reinstating that now outdated rule. However, on June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit s decision, holding that the Clean Power Plan was an extraordinary case of an agency claiming transformative power over a major question of policy without a clear statement from Congress. The decision does not completely bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector but prohibits the EPA from imposing standards based on generation shifting away from coal-fired power plants to natural gas plants and renewable resources. On May 23, 2023, the EPA proposed a new climate change rule for existing power plants and repealed the ACE rule. The new rule requires, by 2030, all existing coal-fired power plants operating beyond 2039 to choose between carbon capture and sequestration by 2032, natural gas-co-firing by 2030, or retirement before 2032. The new rule also applies to all new gas combustion turbines which are categorized by operating level. Units that operate greater than of their operating capacity in a year require carbon capture and sequestration. Units that operate less have an emission limit or the requirement to use lower emitting fuels. These new climate rules have been challenged in the D.C. Circuit, and the challengers have also filed applications to the Supreme Court for a stay during the litigation, which remains pending. Existing combustion turbines will be addressed in a future rule making, which EPA is expected to propose before the end of 2024. These climate change rules are expected to drive additional coal plant retirements, increase electricity pricing and result in electricity reliability concerns. However, the Company does not expect to be disproportionately affected compared with other pulp and paper producers located in the states where the Company operates. The province of Quebec has a greenhouse gas GHG cap-and-trade system with reduction targets. Ontario has its GHG Emission Performance Standards regulation and the province of British Columbia has its own carbon tax programs. The Company does not expect its facilities to be disproportionately affected by these measures compared to the other pulp and paper producers located in these provinces. The Government of Canada has established a federal carbon pricing system that took effect in 2019. The Federal program is a backstop and takes effect if a province does not have a carbon pricing program or if a provincial program is not rigorous enough to meet federal requirements. The EPA finalized amendments revising certain aspects of its Industrial Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standard MACT ), or Boiler MACT in 2022. The revised rule responded to two court decisions that remanded certain issues for further review by the EPA, and it includes revisions to 34 different emission limitations that could apply to some of the Company s facilities. Although the EPA has indicated that a small number of facilities may need to reduce emissions further compared to the current limits, the EPA does not expect additional costs to be significant. On September 3, 2024, EPA s rule amendments were partially set aside by the D.C. Circuit because they failed to properly distinguish between new and existing sources. As a result, EPA is expected to revise its Boiler MACT rules again in the near future. The Company does not expect its facilities to be disproportionately affected compared to other U.S. pulp and paper producers.

Ongoing Administrative Reviews Following Commerce s completion of the Canadian softwood lumber investigation and the first, second, third, fourth and fifth administrative reviews, the sixth administrative review remains pending. On March 5, 2024, Commerce published a notice initiating the sixth administrative review of the countervailing duty and anti-dumping orders on softwood lumber products from Canada; in decisions published on April 9, and 19, 2024, the Company was not selected as a mandatory respondent in the countervailing and anti-dumping proceedings, respectively. Ongoing Appellate Reviews On December 14, 2017 and January 4, 2018, the Company filed complaints supporting appellate reviews of the final results of Commerce s countervailing and anti-dumping investigations on softwood lumber from Canada, respectively, before a binational panel formed pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement or United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, as the case may be Panel ). The Panel issued its decision in the anti-dumping appellate review on October 5, 2023, finding that Commerce's methodology was inconsistent with applicable legal principles and ordering a remand to Commerce, as the Company now awaits Commerce's decision on remand. The hearing for the countervailing appellate review took place from September 27 to 29, 2023. On May 6, 2024, the Panel issued its decision on the countervailing appellate review and remanded to Commerce on certain issues. On January 6, 2021 and January 19, 2021, the Company filed its complaints supporting appellate Panel reviews of the final results in the countervailing and anti-dumping first administrative reviews. The Company filed similar complaints with respect to the second administrative reviews on January 12, 2022, and with respect to the third administrative reviews on September 16, 2022. On May 8, 2023, the Company filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade ("CIT") a complaint supporting an appellate review of Commerce's final results in the sunset review of the anti-dumping order. On October 12, 2023, the Company joined the complaint filed by Canadian parties supporting an appellate Panel review of the final results in the countervailing fourth administration review, and also filed a summons before the CIT to initiate an appellate review of the final results in the anti-dumping fourth administrative review. All appellate reviews described above remain pending.

As of September 30, 2024, a total of million of cash deposits million of countervailing and million of anti-dumping duties) on estimated softwood lumber duties were paid. Of this amount, million of deposits million of countervailing and million of anti-dumping duties) were paid at acquisition date and were included in the purchase price allocation (refer to Note 3 Acquisition and sale of businesses ). These deposits are measured, since the acquisition, using a model based on the assumptions that a settlement would be reached and that a certain percentage of the deposits would b e recovered after a certain period of time. Deposits are remeasured with that model every reporting date and the variation is recorded under Other operating income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

FIBREK ACQUISITION Effective , the Company completed the final step of the transaction pursuant to which it acquired the remaining of the outstanding Fibrek Inc. shares, following the approval of Fibrek s shareholders on July 23, 2012, and the issuance of a final order by the Quebec Superior Court in Canada (the Quebec Superior Court approving the arrangement on July 27, 2012. Certain former shareholders of Fibrek exercised rights of dissent in respect of the transaction, asking for a judicial determination of the fair value of their claim under the Canada Business Corporations Act. On September 26, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court rendered a decision fixing the fair value of the shares of the dissenting shareholders at C per share, or million (C million) in aggregate, plus interest and an additional indemnity, for a total estimated at million (C million) payable in cash. Of this amount, million (C million) was payable immediately and paid on October 2, 2019. The Company has appealed the decision, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal in a judgment dated February 2, 2024, fixing the fair value of the shares of the dissenting shareholders at C per share, or million (C million) in aggregate, plus interest and the additional indemnity for a revised total amount of million (C million), and therefore ordering the Company to pay a balance of million (C million), which was paid on February 7, 2024.

SUPERFUND SITE On May 17, 2023, the EPA issued a General Notice of Liability and Demand for Reimbursement of Response Costs Expended at the Barite Hill/Nevada Goldfields Superfund Site (the Notice of Liability to the Company. The Notice of Liability states that the EPA believes that the Company may be liable under Sections 106 and 107(a) of the Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA for costs the EPA has incurred at the Barite Hill/Nevada Goldfields Superfund Site (the Site ). The approximate total response costs identified by the EPA in the Notice of Liability through January 19, 2023 was approximately million. The Company believes that the EPA may also seek to hold it responsible for future remediation costs at the Site. The Company is currently assessing its defenses to liability at the Site. The Company recognized a provision of million, with respect to the EPA s cause of action for past costs described in the Notice of Liability, as an environmental liability in Other liabilities in the purchase price allocation. See Note 3 Acquisition and sale of businesses for more information. MENOMINEE FIRE Prior to the Acquisition, on October 6, 2022, a fire in a third-party owned warehouse that the Company leases adjacent to its Menominee recycled pulp mill damaged and, in some cases, destroyed, the warehouse, as well as certain of the Company s property, plant and equipment and inventories, which resulted in the temporary idling of the mill. The mill was restarted during the first quarter of 2023, operating at a limited capacity. The fire incident resulted in third-party damages in addition to damages to the Company's Menominee mill. At this time, five claims have been filed in Michigan State Court against the Company, including a complaint by the owner of the warehouse alleging damages in an amount in excess of million, which has been settled for a negligible amount ; and a separate complaint filed by a co-tenant in the warehouse and its insurer alleging damages in an amount in excess of million. The Company currently does not believe it is probable that it will incur any material uninsured loss related to third party claims, nor could any possible loss contingency be reasonably estimable at the present time. The Company maintains insurance coverage, subject to customary deductibles and limits. Anticipated insurance recoveries related to losses and incremental costs incurred, in excess of the deductible, are recognized when receipt is probable. The anticipated insurance recoveries related to the fire, in excess of the net book value of the damaged operating assets and related to business interruption, will not be recognized until all contingencies related to the claim have been resolved.

 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 Sale of El Dorado, Arkansas sawmill 
 On April 30, 2024, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Resolute El Dorado Inc., entered into an asset purchase agreement with Anthony Forest Products Company, LLC, an affiliate of Canfor Corporation (the Purchaser to sell our sawmill located in El Dorado, Arkansas, to the Purchaser for a purchase price of 73 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments.

Paper Excellence group of companies owned both Domtar and Catalyst. 
 The acquisition of Catalyst from Paper Excellence was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control, which requires that Catalyst s related assets and liabilities be transferred at their historical carrying amounts on the acquisition date and requires retrospective combination of entities as if the combination had been in effect since the inception of common control, which was November 30, 2021. Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 3 Acquisition and sale of businesses for more information on the acquisition of Catalyst.

combination of entities as if the combination had been in effect since the inception of common control, which was November 30, 2021. Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 3 Acquisition and sale of businesses for more information on the acquisition of SPI. 
 Paper Excellence completes the acquisition of Resolute Forest Products Inc. through Domtar Corporation 
 On March 1, 2023, Paper Excellence completed the acquisition of Resolute Forest Products Inc. ("Resolute") through Domtar (referred to as the "Acquisition"). The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was 1.696 billion, less cash acquired of 480 million and including the contingent value right on softwood lumber duty deposit refunds. The purchase price allocation reflects a gain of 225 million recorded under Other operating (income) loss, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The Resolute businesses manufacture and market a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products and paper. Total net sales for Resolute during its most recent pre-acquisition year ended December 31, 2022, were 3.8 billion. Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 3 Acquisition and sale of businesses for additional information. 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recognized nil and 57 million, respectively, of transaction related costs associated to the Acquisition, which include advisor and legal fees, as well as the accelerated vesting of certain long-term incentive awards of Resolute. These costs are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the line item entitled Transaction costs. 
 As a condition to obtain the approval of the Acquisition from the Canadian Competition Bureau, we were required to commit to the divestiture of our Dryden, Ontario pulp mill (Domtar) and Thunder Bay, Ontario pulp and paper mill (Resolute), within a short period of time following the Acquisition. Each mill was to be sold to an independent purchaser approved by the Commissioner. On August 1, 2023, we completed the sale of the Dryden pulp mill and related assets for a purchase price of 186 million. On August 1, 2023, we completed the sale of the Thunder Bay pulp and paper mill and related assets for a purchase price of 231 million. The results of operations of the Dryden disposal group were not classified as discontinued operations as the mill was part of the pre-existing assets of Domtar. For the Thunder Bay pulp and paper mill, at the time of the Acquisition on March 1, 2023, the sale of the mill met the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings are included within Earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive income (loss) for the period from March 1, 2023, to September 30, 2023. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows was not reclassified to reflect discontinued operations. The assets and liabilities related to both mills for periods prior to the sale, were presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 4 Discontinued Operations for additional information on the Discontinued Operations. 
 Domtar was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Acquisition, which was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase consideration allocated to Resolute s assets and liabilities is based upon their fair values at the acquisition date. Following the Acquisition date, the operating results of the Resolute business have been included in our consolidated financial statements. Our first nine months of 2023 reflects Resolute financial results for the seven months from March 1, 2023 to September 30, 2023. These financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance.

As a result, during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we recorded 3 million and 8 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation, under Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) (third quarter and first nine months of 2023 2 million and 21 million, respectively, of write-off of property, plant and equipment, under Impairment of long-lived assets on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss)).

 Conversion of Kingsport 
 We have entered the linerboard market with the conversion of our Kingsport facility. The mill is designed to produce and market approximately 600,000 tons annually of high-quality recycled linerboard and medium, providing us with a strategic footprint in a growing adjacent market. This mill is part of our Paper and Packaging business unit. The conversion was fully completed in June 2023. For the first six months of 2023, we recorded 63 million, under Asset conversion costs on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

 OVERVIEW 
 We design, manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of fiber-based products including paper, market pulp, wood products and tissue, which are marketed in over 80 countries. We are the largest integrated manufacturer and marketer of uncoated freesheet paper and uncoated mechanical papers in North America as well as a leading global producer of newsprint, fluff, recycled and softwood pulp. We own or operate manufacturing facilities, including pulp and paper mills, tissue facilities and sawmills, as well as power generation assets in the U.S. and Canada. Our paper and tissue manufacturing operations are supported by converting and forms manufacturing operations. 
 Organizational structure 
 Our organizational structure is comprised of Business Units and a Corporate function. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our internal reporting and reportable segments changed as a result of organizational changes, which are intended to advance and support our long-term growth plans by streamlining and synergizing our North American businesses. Subsequently, we manage and report our operating results through three reportable segments: Paper and Packaging, Pulp and Tissue and Wood Products. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. In addition, in the second quarter of 2023, we completed the acquisition of SPI and in the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed the acquisition of Catalyst, which both require retrospective combination of entities as if the combination had been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the financial information for Domtar, SPI and Catalyst has been combined from the inception of common control which was November 30, 2021, and we have reflected this structure for all historical periods presented for our Paper and Packaging segment. 
 Paper and Packaging : We design, manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of fiber-based products including communication papers, specialty and packaging papers as well as fluff and softwood pulp. We are the largest integrated manufacturer and marketer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. We are also an important supplier of specialty and packaging papers. 
 46 

Pulp and Tissue: We design, manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of fiber-based products including market pulp, tissue, and paper. We are the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America, a leading global producer of newsprint, and a fluff, recycled and softwood pulp producer in North America. 
 Wood Products: We are a large North American producer of lumber and other wood products for the residential construction and home renovation markets, as well as for specialized structural and industrial applications. 
 Our segment measure of profit (operating income (loss) from continuing operations) is used by management to evaluate performance and make operational decisions. Management believes that this measure allows for a better understanding of cost trends, operating efficiencies, prices and volume. Business segment operating income (loss) is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity losses, interest expense, and non-service components of net periodic benefit cost. Corporate expenses are allocated to our segment with the exception of certain discretionary charges and credits, which we present under Corporate and Other and do not allocate to the segments. 
 HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we reported operating income from continuing operations of 120 million, compared to operating loss from continuing operations of 97 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The increase of 217 million to an operating income from continuing operations is principally driven by higher pulp production, higher average selling prices for our pulp products as well as lower input costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices for our paper products. In the third quarter of 2023, we recognized 63 million of closure and restructuring costs mostly related to the idling of our Espanola pulp and paper mill, compared to 2 million in the third quarter of 2024. 
 These and other factors that affected the quarter-to-quarter comparison of financial results are discussed in the quarter-to-quarter analysis and segment analysis. 
 HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 For the first nine months of 2024, we reported operating income from continuing operations of 121 million, compared to operating loss from continuing operations of 34 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 The first nine months of 2023 includes seven months of operations of Resolute following its acquisition on March 1, 2023, while the first nine months of 2024 included nine months of operations of Resolute. The increase of 155 million to an operating income from continuing operations is principally driven the inclusion of nine months, rather than seven months, of the results of Resolute, lower input costs, higher pulp production and lower maintenance costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices for the majority of our products. In addition, in the first nine months of 2023, we recognized 70 million of closure and restructuring costs mostly related to the idling of our Espanola pulp and paper mill, 67 million of transaction costs mostly due to our Resolute acquisition, as well as asset conversion costs of 63 million related to our Kingsport mill conversion, compared to 24 million of closure and restructuring costs in the first nine months of 2024 mostly related to paper machine closures in the first nine months of 2024. 
 These and other factors that affected the quarter-to-quarter comparison of financial results are discussed in the quarter-to-quarter analysis and segment analysis. 
 Economic conditions and uncertainties 
 The markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers. Most of our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers as well. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition for these products is based primarily on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand. For our pulp and paper products, we also compete on the basis of product quality, breadth of offering and service solutions. Furthermore, we compete against electronic transmission and document storage alternatives. As a result of such competition, we are experiencing ongoing decreasing demand for most of our existing paper products. The pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide. Competition is primarily on the product quality and competitively priced pulp products. 
 OUTLOOK 
 For the balance of 2024, we expect the demand and pricing for paper to remain stable and expect some downward price pressure for pulp with demand relatively stable. We will continue to closely monitor our inventory levels and balance our production with demand. For our wood products business, we saw improvement in lumber demand and prices over the last few weeks and we expect this trend to carry on into the balance of the year. We remain positive on the medium and long-term housing fundamentals due to recent decreases in mortgage rates and the housing shortage in both U.S. and Canada. Overall, we anticipate costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, to remain stable. Our near-term focus continues to be on controlling costs and generating cash flow.

Third quarter of 2024 compared to Third quarter of 2023 
 Analysis of Sales 
 Sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 41 million, or 2 , when compared to sales in the third quarter of 2023. This increase in sales is mostly due to an increase in our net average selling prices for our pulp products, partially offset by lower average selling prices for our paper and wood products. Our paper volume was impacted by our paper machine closures at our Crofton and Espanola facilities earlier in 2024 and at Ashdown in early July 2024. Our pulp sales volume was impacted by the sale of our Dryden pulp mill in the third quarter of 2023 and the closure of our Espanola pulp mill in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Analysis of change in Operating Income (Loss) from continuing operations 
 Operating income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 217 million when compared to operating loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2023. This increase is principally driven by higher production and lower input costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices for the majority of our paper and wood products. Our paper volume was impacted by our paper machine closures at our Crofton and Espanola facilities earlier in 2024 and at Ashdown in early July 2024. Our pulp sales volume was also impacted by the sale of our Dryden pulp mill in the third quarter of 2023. 
 First nine months of 2024 compared to first nine months of 2023 
 Analysis of Sales 
 Sales in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 113 million, or 2 , when compared to sales in the first nine months of 2023. The inclusion of three months of sales of Resolute in the first quarter of 2024 compared to one month of sales in the first quarter of 2023, resulted in an increase in sales of 371 million. Excluding the impact of two additional months of sales of Resolute in our first nine months of 2024 when compared to our first nine months of 2023, our sales decreased by 258 million, mostly due to a decrease in our net average selling prices for the majority of our products, as well as a decrease in our paper sales volume, in part due to our paper machine closures at our Crofton, Espanola and Ashdown facilities. Our pulp sales volume was also impacted by the sale of our Dryden pulp mill in the third quarter of 2023 and the closure of our Espanola pulp mill in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Analysis of change in Operating Income from continuing operations 
 Operating income from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2024 increased by 155 million when compared to the first nine months of 2023. The inclusion of three months of operations of Resolute in the first quarter of 2024 compared to one month of operations in the first quarter of 2023, resulted in an increase in operating income from continuing operations of 33 million. Excluding the operations of Resolute in the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, operating income from continuing operations amounted to 122 million in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 122 million compared to operating income from continuing operations of nil in the first nine months of 2023. This increase is principally driven by higher pulp production, lower input costs, partially offset by lower average selling prices for the majority of our products as well as lower volume in our paper products. Our paper volume was impacted by our paper machine closures at our Crofton and Espanola facilities earlier in 2024 and at Ashdown in early July 2024. Our pulp sales volume was impacted by the sale of our Dryden pulp mill in the third quarter of 2023 and the closure of our Espanola pulp mill in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, in the first nine months of 2024, we recognized 24 million of closure and restructuring costs compared to 70 million in the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2023, we recognized asset conversion costs of 63 million related to the conversion of our Kingsport facility compared to nil in the first nine months of 2024, due to the start-up of our Kingsport operations in the second half of 2023. In the first nine months of 2023, we recognized 44 million of transaction costs related to our acquisition of Resolute compared to nil in the first nine months of 2024, under Corporate and Other, excluding costs expensed by Resolute. 
 OTHER FACTORS 
 Interest Expense, net 
 We incurred 61 million of net interest expense in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 4 million compared to net interest expense of 65 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense decreased mainly due to lower debt levels for the three months period in 2024 compared to 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, we had capitalized interest of 1 million, compared to 2 million in the third quarter of 2023. See section Capital Resources below for more information on our debt structure following our Acquisition on March 1, 2023. 
 We incurred 177 million of net interest expense in the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 1 million compared to net interest expense of 176 million in the first nine months of 2023. Interest expense increased due to slightly higher floating rates for SOFR as well as slightly higher average debt levels for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, we had capitalized interest of 5 million, compared to 6 million in the first nine months of 2023. See section Capital Resources below for more information on our debt structure following our Acquisition on March 1, 2023.

Non-Service Components of net periodic benefit cost 
 For the third quarter of 2024, our non-service components of net periodic benefit cost were a benefit of 5 million, an increase of 3 million when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 6 Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans for additional information. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our non-service components of net periodic benefit cost were a benefit of 16 million, an increase of 6 million when compared to the first nine months of 2023. Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 6 Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans for additional information. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the third quarter of 2024, we had income tax expense of 121 million, consisting of 49 million of current income tax expense and deferred income tax expense of 72 million. This compares to income tax expense of 35 million in the third quarter of 2023, consisting of 10 million of current income tax expense and deferred income tax expense of 25 million. We made payments, net of income tax refunds, of 2 million during the third quarter of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 189 compared to -22 for the third quarter of 2023. In each interim quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and, if there are changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was unfavorably impacted by such a cumulative adjustment. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was also unfavorably impacted by such a cumulative adjustment, mainly due to a change in the mix of earnings or loss between jurisdictions, the inclusion of a full valuation allowance on deferred interest expenses, certain losses with no corresponding tax benefit, and additional U.S. taxes from the sale of Canadian mills. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our income tax expense was 25 million, consisting of current income tax expense of 5 million and deferred income tax expense of 20 million. This compares to income tax benefit of 30 million in the first nine months of 2023, consisting of current income tax expense of 16 million and deferred income tax benefit of 46 million. We received refunds, net of income tax payments, of 18 million during the first nine months of 2024. Our effective tax rate was -63 compared to an effective tax rate of 15 in the first nine months of 2023. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was unfavorably impacted by interest expenses with no corresponding tax benefits, foreign exchange items and additional U.S. tax expense on foreign operations. This was partially offset by additional research and experimentation tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was impacted by the reversal of the valuation allowance on tax loss carryforwards due to management s assessment that the future income would be sufficient to utilize the losses prior to expiration. This was partly offset by the inclusion of a full valuation allowance on deferred interest expenses, certain losses with no corresponding tax benefit, U.S. taxes from the sale of Canadian mills, and transaction costs with minimal tax benefit. 
 In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting which agreed to a two-pillar framework to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy and profit shifting. In December 2021, the OECD published the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules ("GloBE Rules") designed to ensure that multinational enterprises are subject to tax at an effective minimum tax rate of 15 in each jurisdiction where they operate. The GloBE Rules have been enacted or are in the process of being enacted into the domestic law of the majority of countries where we operate. For the first nine months of 2024, the GloBE Rules did not impact our financial results. We continue to evaluate their impact on future periods. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 For the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we reported earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of nil and 13 million, respectively. 
 Mandated sale of Thunder Bay, Ontario mill 
 As a condition to obtain the approval of the March 1, 2023, Acquisition from the Canadian Competition Bureau, we were required to commit to the divestiture of Resolute's pulp and paper mill in Thunder Bay, Ontario, within a short period of time following the Acquisition. On August 1, 2023, the mill was sold to an independent acquirer approved by the Commissioner. The assets and liabilities related to the pulp and paper mill for periods after the Acquisition, are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the time of the Acquisition, the sale of the pulp and paper mill met the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings were included within Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (Loss) and Comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented after the acquisition date of March 1, 2023 to July 31, 2023. Refer to Item 1, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 4 Discontinued Operations for additional information on the Discontinued Operations.

Sales 
 Paper and Packaging segment sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased by 33 million, or 3 when compared to sales in the third quarter of 2023. This increase in sales is mostly due to an increase in our net average selling prices and volume for pulp, and an increase in our net average selling prices for our packaging paper products, following its start-up in the third quarter of 2023. These increases were partially offset by lower net average selling prices for paper. Our paper volume was impacted by our paper machine closures at our Crofton and Espanola facilities earlier in 2024 and at Ashdown in early July 2024. Our pulp sales in the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by the sale of our Dryden pulp mill in the third quarter of 2023 and the closure of the pulp operation at our Espanola facility in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Paper and Packaging segment sales in the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 229 million, or 6 when compared to sales in the first nine months of 2023. This decrease in sales is mostly due to a decrease in our net average selling prices for pulp and paper, as well as a decrease in our Communication paper sales volumes, mostly due to a maintenance shutdown at one of our facilities in the second quarter of 2024. Our pulp sales in the first nine months of 2024 were impacted by the sale of our Dryden pulp mill in the third quarter of 2023 and the closure of the pulp operations at our Espanola facility in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in our Specialty and Packaging papers volume is due to including the sales of our recently converted Kingsport mill in our first nine months of 2024 results, partially offset by the closure earlier in 2024 of the paper machine at our Espanola facility and at our Crofton facility and in early July 2024 at our Ashdown facility.

 Operating income from continuing operations in our Paper and Packaging segment amounted to 137 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 175 million, when compared to operating loss from continuing operations of 38 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our results were positively impacted by: 
 Lower operating expenses 87 million) when compared to the third quarter of 2023 mostly due to higher pulp production, the increase in operations of our converted Kingsport mill that had started operations in the third quarter of 2023, lower freight costs, as well as the closure of our Espanola facility and Crofton paper machine, partially offset by higher maintenance costs 

Higher net average selling prices for pulp 30 million) 

Lower depreciation charges 10 million) when compared to the third quarter of 2023, mostly due to an impairment charge 9 million) in the third quarter of 2023 related to the announced idling of our Espanola pulp and paper mill

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our principal cash requirements are for ongoing operating costs, pension contributions, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as principal and interest payments on our debt and income tax payments. We expect to fund our liquidity needs primarily with internally generated funds from our operations and, to the extent necessary, through borrowings under our 1.0 billion ABL Revolving Credit facility, of which 430 million was undrawn and available as of September 30, 2024. Under adverse market conditions, there can be no assurance that this facility would be available or sufficient. See Capital Resources below. 
 Our ability to make payments on the requirements mentioned above will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our credit facility and debt indentures impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. 
 A portion of our cash is held outside the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of the foreign subsidiaries reflect full provision for local income taxes. We remain indefinitely reinvested in the outside basis differences of our foreign subsidiaries. 
 Operating Activities 
 Our operating cash flow requirements are primarily for salaries and benefits, the purchase of raw materials, including fiber and energy, and other expenses such as income tax and property taxes. 
 Cash flows provided from operating activities, including discontinued operations, totaled 17 million in the first nine months of 2024, a 131 million difference compared to cash flows used for operating activities, including discontinued operations, of 114 million in the first nine months of 2023. This improvement in cash flows used for operating activities is primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements as well as a reduction in our net loss. In addition, we had an income tax refund, net of payments, of 18 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to income tax payments, net of refunds, of 68 million during the first nine months of 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we contributed 20 million and 68 million, respectively (2023 17 million and 41 million, respectively) to the pension plans and 4 million and 11 million, respectively (2023 2 million and 9 million, respectively) to the other post-retirement benefit plans. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows used for investing activities, including discontinued operations, in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to 105 million, a 806 million difference compared to cash flows used for investing activities, including discontinued operations, of 911 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 The use of cash for investing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment of 211 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of businesses of 91 million and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of 16 million. 
 The use of cash for investing activities in the first nine months of 2023 was mostly attributable to the acquisition of the Resolute business, net of cash acquired, of 1,098 million, additions to property, plant and equipment of 227 million and was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of business, net of cash disposed, of 417 million and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of 7 million. 
 Our annual capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to total between 300 million and 320 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows provided from financing activities, including discontinued operations, totaled 6 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to cash flows provided from financing activities, including discontinued operations, of 1,111 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 55 

The cash flows provided from financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was attributable to borrowings under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility 71 million), partially offset by repayment of long-term debt as required for quarterly amortization of our Farm Credit Term Loan Facility and First Lien Term Loan 51 million) and lower bank indebtedness 14 million). 
 The primary source of cash flows provided from financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 was attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of the Farm Credit Term Loan 930 million), issuance of capital 583 million) and borrowings under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility 335 million). This was partially offset by the partial repayment of our First Lien Term Loan Facility 283 million), repayment of the assumed debt acquired under the Resolute Acquisition on March 1, 2023 307 million) and repayment to related party 236 million). 
 Capital Resources 
 Net indebtedness, consisting of bank indebtedness, long-term debt and due to related party, net of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, was 2,444 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2,324 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 ABL Revolving Credit Facility 
 On March 1, 2023, we amended our ABL Revolving Credit Facility to mature on March 1, 2028 (extended from November 30, 2026). Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility provides for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amended amount of up to 1.0 billion (up from 400 million), subject to borrowing base capacity. On March 1, 2023, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility was drawn by 210 million to partially fund the Acquisition. 
 Borrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum of, at our option, SOFR (adjusted by 0.10 plus an applicable margin of 1.50 to 2.00 or a base rate plus 0.50 to 1.00 , in each case, depending on excess availability. The base rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.00 . Utilization of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is limited by borrowing base calculations based on the sum of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable, plus specified percentages of eligible inventory, minus the amount of any applicable reserves. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility is subject to an unused line fee of 0.25 to 0.375 , depending upon utilization. 
 Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility, when specified excess availability is less than the greater of 87.5 million and 10 of the lesser of the borrowing base and maximum borrowing capacity, requires the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve month period. This covenant did not apply as at September 30, 2024. 
 On September 30, 2024, we had borrowings of 406 million and 164 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility, leaving unused commitments available to us of 430 million.

The SOFR rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 0.75 and the base rate is subject to an interest rate floor of 1.75 . Borrowings under our Farm Credit Term Loan amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equivalent to 5 per annum of the principal amount.

 GUARANTEES 
 Indemnifications 
 In the normal course of business, we offer indemnifications relating to the sale of our businesses and real estate. In general, these indemnifications may relate to claims from past business operations, compliance with laws, the failure to abide by covenants and the breach of representations and warranties included in sales agreements. Typically, such representations and warranties relate to taxation, environmental, product and employee matters. The terms of these indemnification agreements are generally for an unlimited period of time. At September 30, 2024, we were unable to estimate the potential maximum liabilities for these types of indemnification guarantees as the amounts are contingent upon the outcome of future events, the nature and likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded. These indemnifications have not yielded significant expenses in the past. 
 Pension Plans 
 We have indemnified and held harmless the trustees of our pension funds, and the respective officers, directors, employees and agents of such trustees, from any and all costs and expenses arising out of the performance of their obligations under the relevant trust agreements, including in respect of their reliance on authorized instructions from us or for failing to act in the absence of authorized instructions. These indemnifications survive the termination of such agreements. At September 30, 2024, we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as we do not expect to make any payments pertaining to these indemnifications. 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 Refer to Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements, of the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and choices amongst acceptable accounting methods that affect our reported results of operations and financial position. Critical accounting estimates pertain to matters that contain a significant level of management estimates about future events, encompass the most complex and subjective judgments and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to environmental matters and asset retirement obligations, business combinations, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, closure and restructuring costs, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, income taxes, countervailing duty and anti-dumping duty cash deposits on softwood lumber and contingencies related to legal claims. These critical accounting estimates and policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe these accounting policies, and others, should be reviewed as they are essential to understanding our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 For more details on critical accounting policies, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 There has not been any material change to our policies since December 31, 2023.
