CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Forward-looking statements discuss our business, operations and financial performance and conditions, as well as our plans, objectives and expectations for our business operations and financial performance and condition. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as aim, anticipate, assume, believe, contemplate, continue, could, design, due, estimate, expect, goal, intend, may, objective, plan, predict, positioned, potential, seek, should, target, will, would and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and future trends, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. In addition, statements that we believe or similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. 
 You should understand that the following important factors could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements: 
 uncertainties in obtaining successful non-clinical or clinical results that reliably and meaningfully demonstrate safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ), European Medicines Agency ("EMA") and/or other comparable regulatory authorities for marketing approval for nomlabofusp (nomlabofusp is the International Nonproprietary Name and the United States Adopted Name for CTI-1601 or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future and unexpected costs that may result therefrom; 

our ability to successfully execute our ongoing open label extension study OLE ), including the timing of site initiations and rate of patient enrollment, and our ability to pursue dose escalation; 

our ability to benefit from participating in the FDA s Support for Clinical Trials Advancing Rare Disease Therapeutics START pilot program for the development of nomlabofusp; 

uncertainties associated with the clinical development and regulatory approval for nomlabofusp, including potential delays in the commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials, the timing of a potential Biologics License Application BLA submission for accelerated approval, including our ability to supply to the FDA all required data for the FDA to review and accept an accelerated application, or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future; 

the difficulties and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for nomlabofusp or any other product candidates we may develop in the future, and the indication and labeling under any such approval; 

how long we can continue to fund our operations with our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and our estimates regarding future results of operations, financial position, research and development costs, capital requirements and our access and needs for additional financing; 

our expectations regarding the use of proceeds from recent and future financings, if any; 

our ability, and the ability of third-party manufacturers we engage, to optimize and scale nomlabofusp or any other product candidate s manufacturing process and to manufacture sufficient quantities of clinical supplies, and, if approved, commercial supplies of nomlabofusp or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future and our ability to maintain our relationships and contracts with our key vendors and to identify and contract with alternate or secondary key vendors; 

our ability to realize any value from nomlabofusp and/or any other product candidates we may develop in the future in light of inherent risks and difficulties involved in successfully bringing product candidates to market and the risk that the product candidates, if approved, will not achieve broad market acceptance; 

our ability to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to our business and other regulatory developments in the United States and other countries; 

the size and growth of the potential markets for nomlabofusp, if approved, or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, the rate and degree of market acceptance of nomlabofusp or any other product candidate, if approved, that we may develop in the future and our ability to serve those markets; 

given both approved and competing therapies and products for the treatment of FA, our ability to obtain and maintain designations or eligibility for expedited regulatory programs, and to commercialize current and future product candidates, if approved, (including the impact of potential barriers to entry if competitors are able to establish a strong market position before we are able to commercialize our products); 

our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and defend our intellectual property rights against third parties; 

the performance and compliance with the rules and regulations of the FDA (and all other regulatory authorities) of third parties upon which we depend, including third-party contract research organizations ("CROs"), consultants, and third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and logistics providers; 

our ability to recruit and retain key scientific, technical, commercial, and management personnel and to retain our executive officers; 

our ability to maintain proper functionality and security of our internal computer and information systems and prevent or avoid cyber-attacks, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption; 

the extent to which geopolitical tensions, including regional conflicts around the world, adverse macroeconomic events, including those due to inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, banking instability, monetary policy changes, economic slowdowns or recessions, health epidemics, unforeseen emergencies and other outbreaks of communicable diseases could disrupt our operations, the operations of third parties on which we rely or the operations of regulatory agencies we interact with in the development of nomlabofusp and any other product candidates that we may develop; 

the potential impact of healthcare reform in the United States, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and measures being taken worldwide designed to reduce healthcare costs and limit the overall level of government expenditures. 

These forward-looking statements are based on management s current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the industry in which we operate, and management s beliefs and assumptions are not guarantees of future performance or development and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in some cases beyond our control. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur at all. The factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 14, 2024 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed on May 9, 2024 and August 8, 2024. All forward-looking statements are applicable only as of the date on which they were made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of any unanticipated events. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million . The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for use to fund its operations and capital requirements. The Company has funded its operations to date primarily with proceeds from sales of common stock and proceeds from the sale of prefunded warrants for the purchase of common stock, the acquisition in 2020 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities upon the merger with Zafgen, Inc. ("Zafgen") and, prior to the 2020 merger with Zafgen, capital contributions from Chondrial Holdings, LLC. In February 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering in which the Company issued and sold shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern", the Company has evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. As of the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company expects its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2026. If the timing of the Company's clinical assumptions are delayed, or if there are other forecasted assumption changes that negatively impact its operating plan, the Company could reduce expenditures in order to further extend cash resources. The Company has not yet commercialized any products and does not expect to generate revenue from the commercial sale of any products for several years, if at all. The Company expects that its research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase, that sales and marketing expenses will become significant and, as a result, that it will need additional capital to fund its future operating and capital requirements. Unless and until the Company can generate substantial revenue, management continuously evaluates different strategies to obtain the required funding for future operations. These strategies include seeking additional funding through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt or royalty financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements, strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and/or larger biotechnology companies, or other sources. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and the Company may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on its ability to incur additional debt, limitations on its ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights, minimum required cash balances and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact the Company's ability to conduct its business. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert the Company's management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect its ability to develop and commercialize its product candidates. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all. If such additional financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available in sufficient amounts, or if the Company does not have sufficient authorized shares, the Company may be required to delay, limit, or eliminate the development of business opportunities and its ability to achieve its business objectives, its competitiveness, and its business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. The Company could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and it may be required to relinquish rights to some of its technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to it, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and prospects. In addition, geopolitical tensions, volatility of capital markets, and other adverse macroeconomic events, including those due to inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, banking instability, monetary policy changes and the ability of the U.S. government to manage

million. Accordingly, the shares were issued upon the exercise of these warrants and are included in issued and outstanding common stock. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares, including potentially dilutive common stock equivalents assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, outstanding restricted stock units, and unvested restricted common shares, as determined using the treasury stock method. For periods in which the Company has reported net losses (all periods since inception), diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, since dilutive common stock equivalents are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is antidilutive. The Company excluded and common stock equivalents outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 because they had an anti-dilutive impact due to the net loss incurred for the periods presented.

shares of the Company s common stock and prefunded warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of the Company s common stock, for a price of per share of the common stock and per prefunded warrant. The prefunded warrants were exercisable at an exercise price of and were exercisable indefinitely. In August 2023, the shares of prefunded warrants were exercised and the Company received cash proceeds of six thousand two hundred and eighty-four dollars . The private placement closed on June 1, 2020. The aggregate gross proceeds for the issuance and sale of the common stock and prefunded warrants were million, transaction costs totaled million and resulted in net proceeds of million. The Company s Registration Statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on June 26, 2020, registered the resale of shares of common stock sold and the shares of common stock underlying the prefunded warrants. MTS Health Partners served as placement agent to the Company in connection with the private placement. As partial compensation for these services, the Company issued MTS Health Partners shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company s Ninth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorized the Company to issue up to shares of common stock, par value per share, of which shares were issued and outstanding, and up to shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value per share, of which shares were issued or outstanding. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the Company s common stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and preferences of the holders of the preferred stock. Common stockholders are entitled to receive dividends, as may be declared by the board of directors of the Company (the Board ), if any. cash dividends have been declared or paid to date.

Options outstanding under the Prior Plans will remain outstanding, unchanged, and subject to the terms of the Prior Plans and the respective award agreements, and no further awards will be made under the Prior Plans. However, if any award previously granted under the Prior Plans, expires, terminates, is canceled, or is forfeited for any reason after the approval of the 2020 Plan, the shares subject to that award will be added to the 2020 Plan share pool so that they can be utilized for new grants under the 2020 Plan. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options ISOs ), nonstatutory stock options NSOs ), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and cash or other stock-based awards. ISOs may be granted only to the Company s employees, including the Company s officers, and the employees of the Company s affiliates. All other awards may be granted to the Company s employees, including the Company s officers, the Company s non-employee directors and consultants, and the employees and consultants of the Company s affiliates. shares plus (ii) an annual increase on January 1, 2021 and each anniversary of such date thereafter through January 1, 2030, equal to the lesser of (A) of the shares issued and outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (B) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Board (collectively, the Plan Limit ). The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2020 Plan is over the term of the 2020 Plan. As permitted by the 2020 Plan, the Company added and shares available for grant to the 2020 Plan on January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 , shares of common stock were available for grant under the 2020 Plan. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 , options to purchase shares issued under the Prior Plans were cancelled and became available for grant under the 2020 Plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , options to purchase shares issued under the Prior Plans were cancelled and became available for grant under the 2020 Plan. At September 30, 2024 , options under the Prior Plans remained outstanding at prices ranging from to , and, if unexercised, will return to the 2020 Plan no later than July 15, 2030.

Leases Bala Cynwyd Office Space On August 8, 2019, the Company entered into an operating lease for office space in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, effective as of December 15, 2019, for a period of with an option to extend the lease for three additional years. Due to required tenant improvements to be completed by the landlord, the Company did not take immediate possession of the leased property and the lease term commenced on . On March 9, 2023, the Company executed a lease extension agreement on its original square footage of office space in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania (which was set to expire in August 2023 and agreed to lease an additional square feet of office space from the same landlord. The lease extension on the original square footage commenced on and the Company recorded a right of use asset and lease liability of million as of that date. The new lease on additional square footage commenced on and the Company recorded a right of use asset and lease liability of million as of that date. The right of use assets and lease liabilities with both these leases are reflected in the financial statements as of September 30, 2024 as are the right of use asset and lease liability of the Company's Boston office space discussed below. Boston Office Lease In connection with the Company's 2020 merger with Zafgen described in footnote 1, on May 28, 2020, the Company acquired a non-cancellable operating lease for approximately square feet of office space (the Premises ). The lease expires on . As part of the agreement, the Company is required to maintain a letter of credit, which upon signing was million and was later reduced to million in October 2024, and is classified as restricted cash within the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition to the base rent, the Company is also responsible for its share of operating expenses, electricity and real estate taxes, which costs are not included in the determination of the leases right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. The right-of-use asset is being amortized to other income/(expense) over the remaining lease term as a result of the sublease described below. On October 27, 2020, the Company entered into a sublease agreement (the Sublease with Massachusetts Municipal Association, Inc.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Quarterly Report ), and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 14, 2024 (the "2023 Annual Report"). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. These statements are based on our beliefs and expectations about future outcomes and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. We undertake no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should read the Risk Factors section included in our 2023 Annual Report, in addition to the "Risk Factors" and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements sections of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for patients suffering from complex rare diseases using our novel cell penetrating peptide ("CPP") technology platform. Our lead product candidate, nomlabofusp (nomlabofusp is the International Nonproprietary Name and the United States Adopted Name for CTI-1601), is a subcutaneously administered, recombinant fusion protein intended to deliver tissue frataxin ("FXN"), an essential protein, to the mitochondria of patients with Friedreich's ataxia FA ). FA is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease in which patients are unable to produce sufficient FXN due to a genetic abnormality. Currently, there are no treatment options that address the core deficit of FA, low levels of FXN. Nomlabofusp represents the first potential therapy designed to increase FXN levels in patients with FA. 
 We believe that our CPP platform, which enables a therapeutic molecule to cross a cell membrane in order to reach intracellular targets, has the potential to enable the treatment of other rare and orphan diseases. We intend to use our proprietary platform to target additional orphan indications characterized by deficiencies in or alterations of intracellular content or activity. 
 Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing nomlabofusp, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing third-party manufacturing capabilities, business planning, raising capital, and providing general and administrative support for such operations. 
 Nomlabofusp Program Update 
 Clinical Trials 
 We have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials, a Phase 2 dose exploration trial, and recently initiated an open label extension study OLE in patients with FA. This OLE study is ongoing. 
 In May 2021, after reporting positive top-line data from our Phase 1 FA program, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA placed a clinical hold on our nomlabofusp clinical program after we notified the FDA of mortalities at the highest dose levels of a 26-week non-human primate toxicology study that was designed to support extended dosing of patients with nomlabofusp. In September 2022, the FDA lifted its full clinical hold on the nomlabofusp program and imposed a partial clinical hold. 
 In May 2023, we announced top-line data from our completed 25 mg cohort of a Phase 2, four-week, dose exploration trial of nomlabofusp in patients with FA and provided a complete response to the FDA in June 2023, which included unblinded safety, pharmacokinetic ("PK"), and pharmacodynamic ("PD") data from the Phase 2 trial s completed 25 mg cohort. 
 In June 2023, we met with the FDA. Following that meeting, we submitted a complete response to the FDA s partial clinical hold that included unblinded safety, PK and frataxin data from the Phase 2 trial s completed 25 mg cohort. 
 22 

In July 2023, following the FDA s review of the complete response to the partial clinical hold, the FDA cleared initiation of a second cohort at 50 mg of our four-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 dose exploration trial and initiation of an OLE study with daily dosing of 25 mg. 
 In February 2024, we reported positive top-line data and successful completion of their four-week, placebo-controlled Phase 2 dose exploration study of nomlabofusp in participants with FA. Nomlabofusp was generally well tolerated throughout the four-week treatment periods, had a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and led to dose dependent increases in FXN levels in all evaluated tissues (skin and buccal cells) after daily dosing of 14 days followed by every other day dosing until day 28 in the 25 mg and 50 mg cohorts. Participants in the 25 mg (n=13) and 50 mg (n=15) cohorts were randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of nomlabofusp or placebo. In May 2024 the FDA removed the partial clinical hold on the development of nomlabofusp. Patients who completed treatment in our Phase 2 dose exploration study or who previously completed a prior clinical trial of nomlabofusp are eligible to screen and possibly participate in the OLE study. Current patients in the OLE study either participated in the Phase 2 dose exploration study and/or a previous clinical trial. 
 In March 2024, we dosed the first patient in our OLE trial discussed above, evaluating daily subcutaneous injections of 25 mg of nomlabofusp self-administered or administered by a caregiver. This study is ongoing with seven sites activated and additional patients are continuing to be enrolled and dosed. Participants who completed treatment in the Phase 2 dose exploration study, or who previously completed a prior clinical trial of nomlabofusp, are potentially eligible to screen for the OLE study. The OLE study will evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and frataxin levels in peripheral tissues as well as other exploratory pharmacodynamic markers (lipid profiles and gene expression data) following long-term subcutaneous administration of nomlabofusp. In addition, clinical assessments collected during the study will be compared to data from a matched control arm derived from participants in the Friedreich s Ataxia Clinical Outcome Measures Study ("FACOMS") database. Dose escalation to the 50 mg dose in the OLE study is currently planned following further characterization of the frataxin pharmacodynamics ("PD") at the 25 mg dose. 
 We currently expect to provide a nomlabofusp development program update in mid-December 2024 that will include available safety, pharmacokinetic and frataxin data as well as available clinical outcome observations from patients currently receiving the daily 25 mg dose of nomlabofusp for approximately 30 to 180 days in the ongoing OLE study. An update on enrollment in the OLE study will also be provided. 
 Separately, we have had discussions with the FDA regarding the use of tissue FXN levels as a novel surrogate endpoint. The FDA acknowledged that frataxin deficiency appears to be critical to the pathogenic mechanism of FA, and that there continues to be an unmet need for treatments for FA patients that address the underlying disease pathophysiology. We intend to pursue an accelerated approval using FXN levels, supportive PD and clinical information, and safety data from the OLE study, along with additional non-clinical pharmacology information needed to support the novel surrogate endpoint approach. 
 We are on track to expand the nomlabofusp clinical program into adolescent (12-17 years old) and pediatric (2-11 years old) patients with FA. We expect to initiate a PK run-in study in adolescents by the end of this year and expect to transition these study participants into the ongoing OLE study after assessment of safety and exposure data in the adolescent cohort. The run-in-study will enroll 12-15 adolescent patients and 12-15 pediatric patients who will be randomized 2:1 to receive either nomlabofusp or placebo daily. 
 We are also planning the initiation of a global confirmatory/registration study by mid-2025 with potential sites in the U.S., Europe, the U.K., Canada and Australia. The Biologics License Application ("BLA") filing is targeted in the second half of 2025 to support potential accelerated approval. 
 On May 30, 2024, we announced that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research ("CDER") had selected nomlabofusp as one of a few programs for participation in the Support for Clinical Trials Advancing Rare Disease Therapeutics ("START") Pilot Program. The objective of the program is to accelerate the development of drugs for rare diseases that lead to significant disability or death by facilitating frequent advice and regular communication with the FDA staff to expedite the review process of biologics and drugs. 
 In September 2024, we received the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway ("ILAP")for the treatment of adults and children with FA aimed to facilitate patient access to novel treatments by accelerating time to market through opportunities for enhanced engagements with UK regulatory authorities and other stakeholders. Along with the receipt of the ILAP designation, nomlabofusp has already been granted orphan drug designations in the U.S. and the European Union (EU), Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease designations in the U.S., PRIME designation in the EU, and selected to be in the START pilot program by the FDA. 
 We are subject to risks and uncertainties common to pre-commercial companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development and commercialization by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with governmental regulations, 
 23 

failure to secure regulatory approval for our drug candidates or any other product candidates and the ability to secure additional capital to fund our operations. Product candidates under development will require extensive non-clinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel, infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if our drug development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, it will realize significant revenue from product sales. 
 Financing Activities, including Recent Material Financings 
 We have funded our operations to date primarily with proceeds from sales of common stock, proceeds from the sale of prefunded warrants for the purchase of common stock, the acquisition in 2020 of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash upon the merger with Zafgen, Inc. ("Zafgen") and, prior to the 2020 merger with Zafgen, capital contributions from Chondrial Holdings, LLC. 
 In February 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we issued and sold 19,736,842 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 8.74 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately 161.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. 
 In May 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the "ATM Agreement") with Guggenheim Securities, LLC in connection with the establishment of an at-the-market offering program providing for the sale of up to an aggregate of 100 million of shares of our common stock from time to time. To date, we have made no sales under this ATM agreement. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and, therefore, consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Costs for certain research and development activities, such as manufacturing, non-clinical studies and clinical trials are generally recognized based on the evaluation of the progress of completion of specific tasks using information and data provided by our vendors and collaborators, and accordingly, are considered an area of significant judgment and management s review of manufacturing, non-clinical and clinical expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel and outside vendors to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. We work with vendors and suppliers to ensure that our estimates of our research and development expenses are reasonable. We expect to increase our investment in research and development in order to advance nomlabofusp through additional clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we pursue clinical development of nomlabofusp and/or any other product candidates we develop. 
 Stock Compensation Expense 
 We measure all stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management s best estimates. These estimates are complex, involve a number of variables, uncertainties and assumptions and the application of management s judgment, and thus are inherently subjective. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 
 Prior to May 28, 2020, we were a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information for our common stock. Prior to January 1, 2023, we estimated our expected common stock price volatility solely based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies with comparable characteristics including enterprise value, risk profiles and position within the industry. Beginning on January 1, 
 24 

2023, we began blending our historical data starting in June 2020 (following our merger with Zafgen in 2020) with our historical peer group. We regularly evaluate our peer group to assess changes in circumstances where identified companies may no longer be similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We expect to continue to do so until we have full historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price. 
 The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. The expected dividend yield considers the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 Compensation expense of those awards is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Typically, we issue awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We account for forfeitures as they occur. 
 We classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient s service payments are classified. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts result in clinical success and regulatory approval or collaboration agreements with third parties for our product candidates, we may generate revenue from those product candidates or collaborations. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The majority of our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development activities, and general and administrative costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses, which consist primarily of costs associated with our product research and development efforts, are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of: 
 third-party contract costs relating to research, formulation, manufacturing, non-clinical studies and clinical trial activities; 

employee related costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses for employees engaged in scientific research and development functions; 

external costs of outside consultants and vendors; 

payments made under our third-party licensing agreements; 

sponsored research agreements; 

laboratory consumables; and 

allocated facility-related costs. 

At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical and commercial development of nomlabofusp, or any other product candidates we develop. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical trials and development of nomlabofusp or any other product candidates we develop will depend on a variety of factors, including: 
 the scope, rate of progress and expense of clinical trials and other research and development activities; 

clinical trial results; 

25 

uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rate or design; 

significant and changing government regulation; 

the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals; 

the influence of the FDA or other regulatory authorities on our clinical trial design and timing; 

establishing manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers and risk involved with development of manufacturing processes, FDA pre-approval inspection practices and successful completion of manufacturing batches for clinical development and other regulatory purposes; 

our ability to obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and 

our ability to recruit and retain key research and development personnel. 

A change in the outcome of one or more of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct additional non-clinical or clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, consisting of salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation, costs related to our executive, finance, information technology, and costs related to other administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include insurance expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax, and legal services, including legal expenses to pursue patent protection for our intellectual property. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we hire additional employees to implement, improve and scale our operational, financial, commercial and management systems.

 Other income (expense), net was 2.8 million income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million income in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to interest income earned on a higher investment base.

Research and development expenses 
 Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 29.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by an increase of 20.2 million in nomlabofusp manufacturing costs including lyophilization development, production scaling costs and manufacturing costs related to producing doses to be used in ongoing and planned clinical trials, an increase of 3.2 million in personnel expense due to increased headcount, an increase of 2.9 million in clinical costs primarily associated with the OLE study which began dosing patients in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.9 million in assay development costs, an increase of 0.8 million related to the Track-FA program discussed above, an increase of 0.5 million in stock compensation costs associated with 2024 grants, an increase of 0.5 million in internal lab costs and an increase of 0.3 million of professional fees related to consulting costs. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.5 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase of 1.0 million in personnel expense, an increase of 1.0 million in professional fees primarily related to consulting costs related to commercial activity and other public company related expenses, an increase of 0.3 million of other expense related to computer software, information technology services and recruiting and an increase of 0.2 million in stock compensation costs associated with 2024 grants.

Other income (expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net was 7.8 million income in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.6 million income in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily relates to interest income earned on a higher investment base. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from any sources, including from product sales, and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing nomlabofusp, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing third-party manufacturing capabilities, business planning, capital raising, and providing general and administrative support for such operations. 
 Cash Flows

Net cash used in operating activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used 48.9 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of 51.8 million, adjusted for noncash expenses of 2.4 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulting in a source of cash of 0.4 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities related to our nomlabofusp program and our general and administrative expenses as described above. Noncash expenses primarily relate to stock-based compensation expenses. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable driven primarily by the increase in R D activities discussed as well as an increase in prepaid expense. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used 24.1 million of cash, resulting from our net loss of 24.0 million, adjusted for noncash expenses of 4.7 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulting in a source of cash of 4.8 million. Our net loss was primarily attributed to research and development activities related to our nomlabofusp program and our general and administrative expenses as described above. Noncash expenses are primarily stock-based compensation expense. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investing activities used 104.6 million of cash to purchase 189.2 million of marketable securities, partially offset by 85 million of cash provided by maturities of marketable securities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, investing activities provided 36.0 million of cash, including 102.3 million from maturities of marketable securities partially offset by 66.3 million in purchases of marketable securities. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided 161.8 million of cash flows primarily from an offering of common stock. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, financing activities provided less than 0.1 million of cash from the exercise of stock options and warrants.

Operating Capital Requirements 
 We have not yet commercialized any products and do not expect to generate revenue from the commercial sale of any products for several years, if at all. 
 We have to date incurred net losses. We incurred net losses of approximately 51.8 million and 24.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 240.3 million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 203.7 million, excluding restricted cash of 1.3 million. 
 Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities, and general and administrative costs associated with the development of nomlabofusp and our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, if and as we: 
 continue to advance the development of nomlabofusp through additional clinical trials, including related manufacturing costs; 

seek to identify and advance development of additional product candidates into clinical development and identify additional indications for our product candidates; 

seek to obtain regulatory approvals for nomlabofusp and other potential product candidates; 

identify, acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; 

maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio; and 

expand our operational, financial, commercial and management systems and personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company. 

In February 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we issued and sold 19,736,842 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of approximately 161.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. We anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will fund operations into 2026. If we encounter unexpected delays in our clinical trials or if there are other unanticipated changes to our operating plan from our current assumptions that negatively impact our operations, we may reduce expenditures in order to further extend our existing cash resources. Until we can generate substantial revenue, if ever, we expect to seek additional funding through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt/royalty financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or other sources. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, minimum cash balances, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all. If such additional financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available in sufficient amounts, or we do not have sufficient authorized shares, we may be required to delay, limit, or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners, strategic alliances or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. In addition, geopolitical tensions, volatility of capital markets, and other adverse macroeconomic events, including those due to inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, banking instability, monetary policy changes and the ability of the U.S. government to manage federal debt limits, as well as the potential impact of health crises on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern. 
 29 

If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding when needed and/or on acceptable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research and development programs, the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies, product portfolio expansion and/or pre commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations. Certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 During the periods presented we did not have, and we currently do not have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules, such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheets. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 Please read Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I of Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business, if any. 
 Other Company Information 
 None.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 With respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 31 

PART II - OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are subject to claims in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. To our knowledge, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no, and as of the date of this Quarterly Report, there are no, threatened or pending legal actions that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors 
 You should carefully consider the risk factors described in our 2023 Annual Report under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors. The risks described in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed on May 9, 2024 and August 8, 2024. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
