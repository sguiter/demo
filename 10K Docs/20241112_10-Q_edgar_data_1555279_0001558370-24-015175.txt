 908 DEVICES INC. NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) . The Company is a commercial-stage technology company providing a suite of purpose-built handheld and desktop devices used at the point-of-need for chemical and biochemical analysis in a broad array of markets including life sciences research, bioprocessing, pharma/biopharma, forensics and adjacent markets. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to technology companies in the device industry and of similar size, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations. Potential risks and uncertainties also include, without limitation, uncertainties regarding rising inflation and higher interest rates. Products currently under development will require additional research and development efforts prior to commercialization and will require additional capital and adequate personnel and infrastructure. The Company s research and development may not be successfully completed, adequate protection for the Company s technology may not be obtained, the Company may not obtain necessary government regulatory approval, and approved products may not prove commercially viable. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and competition. Acquisition The Company acquired CAM2 Technologies, LLC (d/b/a RedWave Technology) RedWave ), located in Danbury, Connecticut in April 2024. RedWave is a leading provider of portable FTIR spectroscopic analyzers for rapid chemical identification of bulk materials. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared), an optical spectroscopy technology, is highly regarded for its specific substance identification abilities across a broad range of bulk materials. This acquisition provides the Company with an expanded portfolio of handheld chemical analysis devices for forensic workflows that quickly detect and identify unknown solids, liquids, vapors, and aerosols at the point of need. In addition, RedWave bolsters the Company s desktop portfolio with a line of accessories for pharma Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and industrial QC applications. See Note 13, Acquisition , for further information. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. The Company has incurred recurring losses since inception, including net losses of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents and revenue from product and service will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may seek additional funding through private or public equity financings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company's stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product expansion or commercialization efforts, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.

Developed Technology Software Trade Name The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows that are expected from the use of each asset group. Impairment losses are measured and recorded for the excess of an asset's carrying value over its fair value. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets, the Company utilizes the valuation technique or techniques deemed most appropriate based on the nature of the asset or asset group, which may include the use of quoted market prices, prices for similar assets or other valuation techniques such as discounted future cash flows or earnings.

 to after the shipment or delivery of the product, and such payments typically do not include payments that are variable, dependent on specified factors or events. In limited circumstances, there exists a right of return for a product if agreed to by the Company. Revenue is only recognized for those goods that are not expected to be returned such that it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal of cumulative revenue. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g., extended warranty/service contracts), upon completion of the service or a mix of both. The Company does not enter into significant financing agreements or other forms of variable consideration. Contract assets arise from unbilled amounts in customer arrangements when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer and the Company s right to payment is not only subject to the passage of time. The Company had contract assets related to product or service revenue as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Contract liabilities represent the Company s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which it has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. The Company has determined that its only contract liability related to product and service revenue is deferred revenue, which consists of customer deposits and upfront payments but that have not been recognized as revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within 12 months of the balance sheet date are

When the Company transacts with a channel partner, its contractual arrangement is with the partner and not with the end-use customer. Whether the Company transacts business with and receives the order from a channel partner or directly from an end-use customer, its revenue recognition policy and resulting pattern of revenue recognition for the order are the same.

Marketable Securities U.S. Treasury securities were valued by the Company using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities, which represent a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Contingent Consideration The Company recognizes acquisition-related contingent consideration which represents the estimated fair value of future payments or issuance of the Company s common stock to the former owners of an acquired entity as part of certain transactions. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is measured and reported at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation method or probability weighted scenario based on the unobservable inputs, which are significant to the fair value and classified with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For the acquisition of TRACE Analytics GmbH, located in Braunschweig, Germany Trace in August 2022, the amount is contingent based on the acquired business performance for the milestones ranging from the date of acquisition to June 30, 2024. The unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements include the probabilities of successful achievement of certain technological integration targets, forecasted results or targets, volatility of the common stock price of the Company, and discount rates. The sellers in the Trace acquisition achieved of milestones under the share purchase and transfer agreement, and accordingly the Company paid the sellers million in August 2023 and million in February 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the probability weighted fair value of the remaining future earnout related to the Trace acquisition was determined to be zero and the accumulated accretion under the last milestone and the relative contingent consideration have been reduced to . During the second quarter of 2024, the sellers did not meet the last milestone and the measurement period for the milestone ended on June 30, 2024.

The following is a roll forward of the Company s goodwill balance (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Balances at beginning of period Goodwill acquired Goodwill impairment ) Foreign currency impact ) Balances at end of period The Company evaluates goodwill at least annually on November 1, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As a result of sustained decreases in the Company s publicly quoted share price and market capitalization during the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined that there was a triggering event for its goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets, and other long-lived assets as of September 30, 2024. The Company assessed the definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows for each of these assets to their respective carrying value. The undiscounted cash flows for each of these assets was in excess of their respective carrying value and, as a result, the Company concluded that there was no impairment for these assets. The significant estimates used in fair value methodology, which are based on Level 3 inputs, include the Company's expectations for future operations and projected cash flows, including revenue, gross margin and operating expenses. In performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill, the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeded its fair value. The Company estimated the reporting unit's fair value based on the market capitalization and a related control premium of (reflecting the amount that would be paid by a new controlling shareholder for the benefits resulting from synergies and other potential benefits derived from controlling the acquired company). The Company evaluated the implied control premium by comparing it to control premiums or discounts of recent comparable market transactions, as applicable. As a result of the interim quantitative impairment assessment, the Company recorded a million noncash goodwill impairment charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. When considering a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to our goodwill assessment in future periods, should a triggering event be identified, a further 5 decline in our stock price with all other inputs being equal could result in an impairment charge of approximately 7 million.

On March 10, 2023, SVB, one of our financial institutions, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC as receiver. On March 12, 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board, and FDIC released a joint statement announcing that the FDIC would complete its resolution of SVB in a manner that fully protected all depositors and that depositors would have access to all of their money starting March 13, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had transferred substantially all its cash and cash equivalents away from SVB and deposited the funds with new financial institutions. As a result of the transfer of the Company s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the Company was in default of its financial covenants under the 2022 Revolver. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. On August 4, 2023, the Company entered into a Default Waiver and First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Amended 2022 Revolver ), by and between, the Company, as borrower, and SVB, as lender. The Amended 2022 Revolver provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million. The Company is permitted to make interest-only payments on the revolving line of credit through November 3, 2025, at which time all outstanding indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable. The outstanding principal amount of any advance shall accrue interest at a floating rate per

The Company s obligations under the Amended 2022 Revolver are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets, excluding its intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. The revolving line of credit under the Amended 2022 Revolver terminates on November 3, 2025. Pursuant to the Amended 2022 Revolver, SVB waived filing any legal action or instituting or enforcing any rights and remedies it may have had against the Company in connection with the Company s failing to maintain all of its operating accounts, depository accounts and excess cash with SVB, as previously required prior to the effectiveness of the Amended 2022 Revolver. The Company recorded a credit of million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the previously recorded early termination penalties. The Amended 2022 Revolver also contains certain financial covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain million on account at or through SVB and the amount of unrestricted and unencumbered cash minus advances under the Amended 2022 Revolver is not less than the amount equal to the greater of (i) million or (ii) nine (9) months of cash burn. The Amended 2022 Revolver contains customary representations and warranties, as well as certain non-financial covenants, including limitations on, among other things, the Company s ability to change the principal nature of its business, dispose of the Company s business or property, engage in any change of control transaction, merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, incur additional indebtedness or liens, pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock, redeem the Company s capital stock, engage in transactions with affiliates or otherwise encumber the Company s intellectual property, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. shares of preferred stock, all of which is undesignated. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders. Common stockholders are not entitled to receive dividends, unless declared by the board of directors. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share, of which warrants for the purchase of shares and shares expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively. Net Income (Loss) per Share The Company only has one class of shares outstanding and basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards. For periods in which the Company reports a net loss, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. As the Company has reported a net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share. The Company excluded the following potential shares of common stock, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as the impact of including such common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive:

In March 2023, performance-based restricted stock units, Market Condition Based PSUs was granted under the Company s 2020 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan to the Company s chief executive officer. The vesting of the shares underlying the Market Condition Based PSUs is subject to the achievement of stock price levels pre-established by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors at the grant date. The Market Condition Based PSUs are subject to the market and service conditions and valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which requires certain assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and the estimated dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate used in the Monte Carlo simulation model is based on -coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the performance period on the market condition based PSUs. The performance period of the Market Condition Based PSUs represents the period of time between the grant date and the end of the performance period. Expected volatility is based on historical data of the peers and certain indices over the most recent time period equal to the performance period. In May 2024, performance-based restricted stock units, Performance Condition Based PSUs were granted under the 2020 Plan to employees. Each Performance Condition Based PSU is equivalent in value to share of the Company s common stock and related to revenue targets for the period up to April 2026.

The Amended Danbury Lease is accounted for as a lease modification, which resulted in new separate operating leases which are the original lease space (the first floor lease and the expanded space (the third floor lease ). The lease term of the first floor lease commenced in June 2024, which was the point at which the Company obtained control of the leased premises. On the commencement date of the first floor lease, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability of million, respectively, and is accounted for as an operating lease. In August 2024, the Company obtained control of the expanded space under the third floor lease, and with occupancy began the term of .

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made million and million, respectively, in contributions to the plan. Contingent Consideration Earnouts and Pension liabilities Earnouts and Pension liabilities from acquisition of Trace Analytics GmbH The Company agreed to pay milestone based earnouts under the purchase agreement to acquire Trace (now 908 Devices GmbH) in August 2022 for the total potential payout of million. Milestones were based on target revenues, and technical integration of 908 Devices GmbH (formerly Trace) systems and knowledge, and ranged from the closing date of August 3, 2022 to September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company withheld million of consideration in connection with pension obligations to be transferred post-closing. During 2023, the Company received notice that the pension obligation had been transferred and was no longer in 908 Devices GmbH s name and therefore the Company released the million assignment of the pension liability. The 908 Devices GmbH acquisition consideration withheld in respect of the pension plan was paid out to the sellers in April 2023 . of milestone based earnouts were achieved, pursuant to which the Company made a million payment was made in August 2023 and a million payment was made in February 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the probability weighted fair value of the remaining future earnout relating to the Trace acquisition was determined to be zero. Accordingly, the accumulated accretion under the last milestone and the relative contingent consideration have been reduced to . Earnouts from acquisition of RedWave Technology The Company may also be obligated to issue up to an additional unregistered shares of the Company s common stock as contingent consideration to the Beneficial Sellers in connection with the acquisition of RedWave, based on the amount of revenue the Company generates from the sale of certain RedWave products and services during the two-year period from May 1, 2024 through April 30, 2026, as set forth in more detail the Purchase Agreement. If the earnout revenue achieved during the period is at least million, the Company will be obligated to issue at least contingent shares, which number of contingent shares will be increased based on the amount of earnout revenue achieved during the period, up to a maximum of contingent shares for earnout revenue equal to or greater than million. The earnout revenue also may include certain qualified bookings credit, as defined in the Purchase Agreement, for certain RedWave products in the event that earnout revenue is otherwise above million. contingent shares will be issued if the earnout revenue achieved during the period is less than million.

 million in cash and unregistered shares of the Company s common stock, which reflects closing adjustments relating to working capital, cash and debt adjustments. The cash consideration is subject to additional working capital, cash, debt, and transaction expense adjustments. Approximately million of the cash consideration was placed into an indemnification escrow account until April 29, 2025 to settle certain claims for indemnification for breaches or inaccuracies in RedWave s representations and warranties, covenants, and agreements. The transaction closed on April 29, 2024, at which time RedWave became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company may also be obligated to issue up to an additional unregistered shares of the Company s common stock as contingent consideration (see Note 12). The Company has accounted for the acquisition of RedWave as a business combination under U.S. GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of RedWave have been recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values, and consolidated with those of the Company. The Company has preliminarily allocated the purchase price to the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of April 29, 2024. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of September 30, 2024. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquired intangible assets, goodwill and among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date and no measurement period adjustments have been made since the acquisition date of April 29, 2024.

The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired business's net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company and RedWave, and has been allocated to goodwill, which is not tax deductible. The fair value of RedWave s technology-based intangible assets were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method which measures economic benefit indirectly by calculating the income attributable to an asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary assets used in conjunction with the subject asset to produce the earnings associated with the subject assets, commonly referred to as contributory asset charges. Under this method, the value of an asset is a function of several components, including the forecasted revenue, earnings generated by the asset, expected economic life of the asset, contributory asset charges and a discount rate. The fair value of the customer relationships was calculated using a distributor method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates a variation of the multi-period excess earnings method that uses market-based inputs to value an asset. Under this method, the value of the asset is a function of several components, including revenue associated with the existing customers, distributor profit margin, charges for use of other assts and discount rate. Intangible assets acquired have finite life and are amortized per our accounting policy. See Note 2 for the amortization periods. The results of RedWave s operations have been included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. RedWave contributed million in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company has not disclosed RedWave s net income or loss since the acquisition date because the RedWave business is fully integrated into the condensed consolidated Company s operations and therefore it was impracticable to determine these amounts.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024 2023 Form 10-K ). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in Item 1.A. Risk Factors section of our 2023 Form 10-K, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We have developed an innovative suite of purpose-built handheld and desktop devices for point-of-need chemical analysis. Leveraging complementary analytical technologies including our proprietary mass spectrometry, or Mass Spec, microfluidics, and analytics and machine learning technologies, we make devices that are significantly smaller and more accessible than conventional laboratory instruments. Our devices are used at the point-of-need to interrogate unknown and invisible materials and provide quick, actionable answers to directly address some of the most critical problems in forensics, bioprocessing, pharma/biopharma, life science research and adjacent markets. We create simplified measurement devices that our customers can use as accurate tools where and when their work needs to be done, rather than overly complex and centralized analytical instrumentation. We believe the insights and answers our devices provide will accelerate workflows, reduce costs, and offer transformational opportunities for our end users. Front-line workers rely upon our handheld devices to combat the opioid crisis and detect counterfeit pharmaceuticals and illicit materials in the air or on surfaces at levels 1,000 times below their lethal dose. First responders also utilize our handheld devices to detect and identify thousands of hazardous bulk materials. Our desktop devices are accelerating development and production of biotherapeutics by identifying and quantifying extracellular species in bioprocessing critical to cell health and productivity. They sit alongside or are directly connected to bioreactors and fermenters producing drug candidates, functional proteins, cell and gene therapies, and synthetic biology derived products. We believe the insights and answers our devices provide accelerate workflows, reduce costs, and offer transformational opportunities for our end users. The term products as used in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refers to the MX908, ThreatID, ProtectIR, XplorIR, Rebel, ZipChip Interface, Maverick, Maven and related sampling devices. On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with CAM2 Technologies, LLC (d/b/a RedWave Technology) RedWave ), CAM3 HoldCo, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company Seller Entity ), each of the holders of outstanding equity interests of Seller Entity (the Beneficial Sellers ), and the other parties thereto, pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of RedWave, and the transaction closed on the same day. The purchase price included an initial payment of 45.0 million in cash and 1,497,171 unregistered shares of the Company s common stock, which reflects closing adjustments relating to working capital, cash and debt adjustments. The cash consideration is subject to additional working capital, cash, debt, and transaction expense adjustments. RedWave is a leading provider of portable FTIR spectroscopic analyzers for rapid chemical identification of bulk materials. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared), an optical spectroscopy technology, is highly regarded for its specific substance identification abilities across a broad range of bulk materials. This acquisition provides the Company with an expanded portfolio of handheld chemical analysis devices for forensic workflows that quickly detect and identify unknown solids, liquids, vapors, and aerosols at the point of need. In addition, RedWave bolsters the Company s desktop portfolio with a line of accessories for pharma Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and industrial QC applications. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend on the successful further development and commercialization of our products. We generated revenue of 40.8 million and 35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and incurred net losses of 52.8 million and 29.0 million for those same periods. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 223.4 million. We expect to continue to incur net losses as we focus on growing sales of our products in both the United States and international markets, including expanding our sales teams as we grow, scaling our manufacturing operations,

 continuing research and development efforts to develop new products and further enhance our existing products. Further, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we may need additional funding for expenses related to our operating activities, including selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and strategic alliances. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the further development and commercialization efforts of one or more of our products, or may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and revenue from product and service will enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See Liquidity and Capital Resources . Global Economic Conditions We are continuing to closely monitor macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, continued inflationary and interest rate pressures, challenging capital market conditions and the limited availability of financing alternatives, which may have an impact on our business, results of operations and financial results. We are closely monitoring continued economic uncertainty in the United States and abroad, including volatility in the global markets and the rise and fluctuations in inflation and interest rates. These developments and the potential worsening of other macro-economic conditions present risks for us, and our suppliers and customers. For example, general inflation in the United States, EMEA and other geographies has recently been at levels not experienced in recent decades, which has led to higher prices for our raw materials and other inputs, as well as higher salaries and travel expenses, which could continue to negatively impact our business by increasing our cost of sales and operating expenses. General inflation could also negatively impact our business if it leads to spending pressure and decreased available capital for our customers to deploy to purchase our products and services. In addition, while the United States Federal Reserve has recently begun to lower interest rates, it has over the past couple of years raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Inflation, together with increased interest rates, may cause our customers to reduce or delay orders for our goods and services thereby causing a decrease in or change in timing of sales of our products and services. The impact of future inflation and interest rate fluctuations on the results of our operations cannot be accurately predicted. Challenging capital market conditions and the limited availability of financing alternatives, together with inflationary and interest rates pressures, may contribute to more cautious spending by our customers. Certain of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, including bioprocessing customers, may evaluate their inventory levels, cash on hand and path to profitability, and institute cost controls and take other actions to reduce or delay purchases of our products and services. We cannot accurately predict the full impact of current macroeconomic factors on the budgets and capital expenditures of our customers, or the timing of the normalization of customer purchasing patterns. We are closely monitoring the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the ongoing hostilities in Israel, Lebanon, and the Gaza Strip and other locations in the Middle East. Although we do not directly source any material products or supplies from Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Lebanon or the Gaza Strip, our customers in Europe and the Middle East could be impacted by extended conflicts or an escalation of these conflicts into neighboring countries. While it is difficult to predict all of the impacts these global economic events and continued inflationary and interest rate pressures will have on our business and to predict the effects of these factors on our customers spending in the near term, we believe the long-term opportunity that we see for our products and services remain unchanged.

 For further discussion of the possible impacts of these global factors and other risks on our business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our 2023 Form 10-K. Factors Affecting Our Performance We believe that our financial performance has been and in the foreseeable future will continue to be primarily driven by the following factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations. Our ability to successfully address the factors below is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Device sales Our financial performance has largely been driven by, and in the future will continue to be impacted by, the rate of sales of our handheld and desktop devices. Management focuses on device sales as an indicator of current business success and a leading indicator of likely future recurring revenue from consumables and services. We expect our device sales to continue to grow as we increase penetration in our existing markets and expand into, or offer new features and solutions that appeal to, new markets. We plan to grow our device sales in the coming years through multiple strategies including expanding our sales efforts domestically and globally and continuing to enhance the underlying technology and applications for bioprocessing and life sciences research related to our Maverick, Rebel, ZipChip Interface, and Maven and related sampling devices. We regularly solicit feedback from our customers and focus our research and development efforts on enhancing our devices and enabling our customers to use additional applications that address their needs, which we believe in turn helps to drive additional sales of our devices and consumables. Our sales process varies considerably depending upon the type of customer to whom we are selling. Our handheld device orders relate to our MX908, ThreatID, ProtectIR, and XplorIR, as well as components for the Aerosol and Vapor Chemical Agent Detectors AVCAD sold to our channel partner. Historically, our handheld devices have been used by municipal, state, federal and foreign governments and governmental agencies. Our sales process with government customers is often long and involves multiple levels of approvals, testing and, in some cases, trials. Device orders from a government customer are typically large orders and can be impacted by the timing of their capital budgets. As a result, the revenue for our handheld devices can vary significantly from period-to-period and has been and may continue to be concentrated in a small number of customers in any given period. Our desktop devices are typically used by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academia markets. Our sales cycles within these markets tend to vary based on the size of the customer and the number of devices they purchase. Our shortest sales cycles are typically for small laboratories and individual researchers where, in some cases, we receive purchase orders from these customers within three months. Our sales process with other institutions can be longer with most customers submitting purchase orders within six to twelve months. Given the variability of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future experience, fluctuations in our desktop device sales on a period-to-period basis. Recurring revenue We regularly assess trends relating to recurring revenue which includes consumables, accessories and services based on our product offerings, our customer base and our understanding of how our customers use our products. Recurring revenue was 39 and 33 of total product and service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our recurring revenue as a percentage of total product and service revenue will vary based upon new device placements in the period. As our device installed base expands, recurring revenue on an absolute basis is expected to increase and over time should be an increasingly important contributor to our revenue. Revenue from the sales of consumables will vary by type of device. We expect that recurring revenue as a percentage of the original device price to be higher for our desktop devices (Rebel, ZipChip Interface, Maverick, Maven and related sampling devices) than for our handheld devices (MX908, ThreatID, ProtectIR, and XplorIR). While we sell single-use swab samplers for MX908 to be used in liquid and solid materials analysis, there are a number of other applications that the MX908 can be used for that do not require consumables. ThreatID, ProtectIR, and XplorIR do not have consumables. Rebel and ZipChip

 Interface require consumables kits for all areas of operations. Currently, Rebel customers, who are actively utilizing the device, are consuming on average approximately half a 200-sample kit per month; however, Rebel is a relatively new product and purchasing patterns related to our consumables kits are evolving. We expect that the number of kits sold per month will vary over the short term. In time, we expect Rebel consumables kits sales to become more consistent as our installed base grows and our customers establish usage patterns. At maximum potential capacity, with continuous operation, the Rebel can consume approximately one 200-sample kit per day. Maverick devices require consumables, probes and standards for all areas of operations. Maven and related sampling devices require consumable sets of buffers, probes and biosensors for all areas of operations. Revenue mix and gross margin Our revenue is derived from sales of our devices, consumables, accessories and services. There will be fluctuations in mix between devices and recurring from period-to-period. Over time, as our device installed base grows and we see adoption of Rebel, we expect consumables revenue to constitute a larger percentage of product and service revenue. However, the percentage will be subject to fluctuation based upon our handheld sales in a period. In addition, our selling price and, consequently, our margins, are higher for those devices and recurring revenue that we sell directly to customers as compared to those that we sell through channel partners. While we expect the mix of direct sales as compared to sales through channel partners to remain relatively constant in the near term, we are currently evaluating increasing our direct sales capabilities in certain geographies. Future device and recurring selling prices and gross margins may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the introduction by others of competing products and solutions. We aim to mitigate downward pressure on our average selling prices by increasing the value proposition offered by our devices and consumables and accessories, primarily by expanding the applications for our devices and increasing the quantity and quality of data that can be obtained using our consumables. Product adoption We monitor our customers stages of adoption of our products to provide insight into the timing of future potential sales and to help us formulate financial projections. Typical stages of adoption include testing, trials, pilot and deployment as follows: Testing - a customer is actively engaged with internal or external testing of our products. This may include an onsite or virtual demonstration with a salesperson, a customer submitting samples for testing in one of our facilities or testing by a third party. Trials - a customer has committed to a trial of one of our products, which may include a defined period to assess functionality of the device in their operational environment (in the field or onsite within the customer s facility). Pilot - a customer commits to the purchase of an initial quantity of devices to deploy in their operational environment to assess a broader opportunity that may grow to tens or hundreds of devices. Deployment - a customer has completed testing, a trial, and/or a pilot and intends to roll out the technology across their enterprise (either at a site or throughout the entire organization). 
 Key Business Metrics We regularly review the number of product placements and cumulative product placement as key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics are representative of our current business; however, we anticipate these will change or may be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business grows.

Device sales accounted for 61 and 67 of our product and service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Recurring revenue accounted for 39 and 33 of our product and service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our current device offerings include: Handheld devices MX908 ThreatID, ProtectIR, XplorIR and AVCAD components; and Desktop devices Rebel and ZipChip Interface, Maverick, and Maven and related sampling devices. We sell our devices directly to customers and through channel partners. Each of our device sales drives various streams of recurring revenue comprised of consumable and accessory product sales and service revenue. Our consumables consist of: MX908 accessories and swabs; Rebel consumables kit with a microfluidic chip and standards; ZipChip Interface microfluidic chip, reagent and assay kits; Maverick calibration kits and accessories; and Maven and related sampling devices probes, tubing sets and accessories. Rebel and ZipChip Interface consumables can only be used with our devices and there are no alternative after-market options that can be used as a substitute. Each chip is used for a defined number of samples (or runs). We recognize revenue from the sale of consumables as the consumable products are shipped. We also offer our customers extended warranty and service plans. Our extended warranty and service plans are offered for periods beyond the standard one-year warranty that all of our customers receive. These extended warranty and service plans

Table of Contents 
 generally have fixed fees and terms ranging from one additional year to four additional years. We recognize revenue from the sale of extended warranty and service plans over the respective coverage period, which approximates the service effort provided by us. We expect consumables and service revenue to increase in future periods as our installed base grows and we are able to generate recurring sales. Contract revenue Contract agreements are arrangements whereby we provide engineering services for the development of our technology platform for specific programs or new and expanding applications of our technologies for future commercial endeavors. Our contract agreements are with the U.S. government and commercial entities (who may be contracting with the government). Contracts typically include compensation for labor effort and materials incurred related to the deliverables under the contract. Our contract revenue was related to one customer during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our revenue was comprised of revenue from the following sources: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Product and service revenue: Device sales revenue 10,645 10,719 24,739 23,761 Recurring revenue 6,087 3,578 15,931 11,747 Total product and service revenue 16,732 14,297 40,670 35,508 Contract revenue 41 141 370 Total revenue 16,773 14,297 40,811 35,878 Our product and service revenue is comprised of sales of our handheld and desktop devices and related consumables, accessories and service contracts to end-users in the government, pharmaceuticals/biotechnology and academia markets as follows: 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Government 13,948 11,740 32,476 26,732 Pharmaceutical/Biotechnology 2,738 2,546 8,060 8,705 Academia and other 46 11 134 71 Total product and service revenue 16,732 14,297 40,670 35,508 We sell our products primarily in the United States; however, we continue to expand our global sales efforts as we see traction in our products and assess global market needs. The majority of our international sales are through a distribution channel. Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Product cost of revenue primarily consists of costs for raw material parts and associated freight, shipping and handling costs, royalties, contract manufacturer costs, salaries and other personnel costs, overhead, amortization of intangibles and other direct costs related to those sales recognized as product revenue in the period. Cost of revenue for services primarily consists of salaries and other personnel costs, travel related to services provided, facility costs associated with training, warranties and other costs of servicing equipment on a return-to-factory basis and at customer sites. Contract cost of revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel costs, materials, travel and other direct costs related to the revenue recognized in the period. The contract cost of revenue will vary based upon the type of contract, including whether it is primarily for development services or for both materials and development services. 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 We expect that our cost of revenue will increase or decrease to the extent that our revenue increases and decreases and depending on how many contracts we have ongoing at any given point in time and the stage of those contracts. Gross profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue. Gross profit margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross profit in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including: market conditions that may impact our pricing, sales mix among devices, sales mix changes among consumables, excess and obsolete inventories, our cost structure for manufacturing operations relative to volume, and product warranty obligations. Our gross profit in future periods will vary based upon our channel mix and may decrease based upon our distribution channels and the potential to establish original equipment manufacturing channels for certain components of our technology platform which would have a lower gross margin. We expect that our gross profit margin for product and service will increase over the long term as our sales and production volumes increase and our cost per unit decreases due to efficiencies of scale. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing, which we believe will reduce costs and increase our gross margin. We expect that our gross profit margin for contract will remain consistent for our contracts that are cost reimbursement contracts. Operating Expenses Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, product development, hardware and software engineering and consultant services and other costs associated with our technology platform and products, which include: employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and hardware and software development functions; the cost of maintaining and improving our product designs, including third party development costs for new products and materials for prototypes; research materials and supplies; and facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance. 
 We believe that our continued investment in research and development is essential to our long-term competitive position and expect these expenses to increase in future periods. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel costs, and stock-based compensation for our sales and marketing, finance, legal, human resources and general management, as well as professional services, such as legal, audit and accounting services. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of customer relationship and tradename intangibles to increase in future periods as the number of sales, sales application specialists and marketing and administrative personnel grows and we continue to introduce new products, invest in demonstration equipment, broaden our customer base and grow our business. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company. Change in fair value of contingent consideration Change in fair value of contingent consideration represents the change in fair value of the contingent consideration obligation included in contingent consideration on the consolidated balance sheets as of the end of each period. Remeasurement of the contingent consideration obligation is done each quarter and the carrying value of the obligation is adjusted to the current fair value through our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

 Goodwill impairment Goodwill impairment is the result of the fair value of our single reporting unit being less than its carrying value. The goodwill impairment resulted from sustained decreases in our publicly quoted share price and market capitalization. When considering a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to our goodwill assessment in future periods, could a triggering event be identified, a further 5 decline in our stock price with all other inputs being equal could result in an impairment charge of approximately 7 million. Other Income (Expense) Interest income Interest income consists of interest earned on our invested cash balances. Interest expense Interest expense consists of interest expense associated with outstanding borrowings under our loan and security agreements and the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts associated with such arrangements. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net consists of interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, miscellaneous other income and expense unrelated to our core operations. Provision for Income Taxes We have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits for the net operating losses we have incurred in each year or for the research and development tax credits we generated in the United States and have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred assets, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. We recognized an income tax benefit of 0.2 million and 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily resulted from a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of our acquisition of 908 Devices GmbH. As of December 31, 2023, we had gross federal and state operating loss carryforwards of 108.2 million and 77.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2032 and 2025, respectively, of which 73.8 million of federal gross operating losses do not expire. As of December 31, 2023, we also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of 7.2 million and 3.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2032 and 2030, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 and a 0.3 million decrease in desktop product revenue, mainly due to the desktop device placement mix for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Product cost of revenue increased by 1.6 million, or 34 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in product cost of revenue was primarily related to an increase in production costs related to the higher product revenues, 0.6 million in higher intangible amortization, 0.6 million in higher manufacturing costs due to favorable manufacturing variances in the comparable prior period, and 0.4 million in higher personnel related costs, partly related to our RedWave acquisition, offset in part by 0.2 million in lower warranty costs. Product gross profit decreased by 0.9 million, or 12 , and gross profit margin decreased by eleven percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in product gross profit was primarily due to the higher intangible amortization resulting in a five percentage point decrease, as well as credits within manufacturing variances during the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a five percentage point decrease. Service Our service revenue is comprised of revenue from sales of extended warranty and service plans and customer training as follows:

The increase was primarily related to an increase in handheld service revenues related to extended service contracts for MX908 devices and our recently acquired FTIR products, and to a lesser extent, an increase in handheld training revenue. Service cost of revenue increased by 0.4 million, or 24 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in service cost of revenue was primarily related to a 0.2 million increase in personnel and other operating costs primarily related to our RedWave acquisition as well as other increases across materials, depreciation and stock compensation. Service gross profit increased by 369 and gross profit margin increased by 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in service volume related to training and extended service contracts, leveraging our investments in personnel and service infrastructure.

The increase was partly due to the increased expenses from the RedWave acquisition and was due primarily to a 1.1 million increase in salaries and related costs, a 0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation, a 0.3 million increase in consulting expenses costs and a 0.2 million increase in audit and related costs. Change in fair value of contingent consideration The key assumptions, such as revenue projection, equity volatility rate of the Company, revenue volatility rate and discount rate are utilized to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration under Monte Carlo simulation. The decline in such key assumptions resulted in an adjustment to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of a credit of 12.1 million that reduced the value of our contingent consideration liability for that period. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, a charge of 0.1 million was recorded to reflect an increase in the value of the contingent consideration liability related to the Trace acquisition. Goodwill impairment As a result of sustained decreases in our publicly quoted share price and market capitalization, a 30.5 million goodwill impairment was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Other Income Interest income Interest income decreased by 0.6 million to 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to the lower cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the lower average balance due to the use of cash for the RedWave acquisition in April 2024. Interest expense Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was a 0.4 million recovery of debt termination fees. We did not recognize any interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other expense, net Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 did not change materially from the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 our subcontract agreement with a commercial entity that holds a U.S. government prime contract, which was concluded in the second quarter of 2023. Contract cost of revenue decreased by 23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the lower contract revenue but also impacted by the higher costs to perform under the new contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Contract gross profit decreased by 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the reduced level of funding and the lower gross profit with our new contracts compared to our prior arrangement during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Other Income Interest income Interest income decreased by 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to the lower cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balance, primarily due to the average balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partly due to the use of cash with the RedWave acquisition. Interest expense Interest expense decreased by 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to costs incurred in March 2023 related to the write-off of deferred financing costs on our 2022 Revolver, which was in default and later amended in August 2023. Other expense, net Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 did not change materially from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Benefit for Income Taxes Benefit for income taxes was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relatively unchanged from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from sales of redeemable preferred stock, borrowings under loan agreements and revenue from sales of our products and services and contract revenue, proceeds from our initial public offering in December 2020, and with proceeds from an underwritten public offering in November 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 71.7 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: market uptake of our products and growth into new and existing markets; the cost of our research and development efforts to expand the applications of our current devices and to create enhanced products with our platform of technologies; the cost of expanding our commercial operations, including distribution capabilities, and accelerating planned investments, such as hiring additional support, service, and sales management in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, bolstering our infrastructure in these regions; the cost of acquiring complementary businesses, products, services or technologies, when and if required;

 the success of our existing collaborations and our ability to enter additional collaborations in the future; the effect of competing technological and market developments; and the level of our selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 On November 2, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the 2022 Revolver, with Silicon Valley Bank, or the Lender. The 2022 Revolver provided for a revolving line of credit of up to 35.0 million. We were permitted to make interest-only payments on the revolving line of credit through November 2, 2025, at which time all outstanding indebtedness would be immediately due and payable. The outstanding principal amount of any advance accrued interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) three and one-half percent (3.50 and (ii) the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal for the relevant period minus one-half percent (0.50 ). Our obligations under the 2022 Revolver were secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, which was subject to a negative pledge. The revolving line of credit under the 2022 Revolver was scheduled to terminate on November 2, 2025. The 2022 Revolver also contained certain financial covenants, including a requirement that the amount of unrestricted and unencumbered cash minus advances under the 2022 Revolver was not less than the amount equal to the greater of (i) 10.0 million or (ii) nine (9) months of cash burn. The 2022 Revolver contained customary representations and warranties, as well as certain non-financial covenants, including limitations on, among other things, our ability to change the principal nature of our business, dispose of our business or property, engage in any change of control transaction, merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, incur additional indebtedness or liens, pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock, redeem our capital stock, engage in transactions with affiliates or otherwise encumber our intellectual property, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. As of December 31, 2023, there were no balances outstanding under the 2022 Revolver. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal balance under the 2022 Revolver was 15.0 million, which was repaid in full on January 4, 2023. The interest rate applicable to borrowing under the 2022 Revolver was 7.0 as of December 31, 2022. On March 10, 2023, the Lender, also one of our financial institutions, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, as receiver. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had transferred substantially all its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities away from the Lender and deposited the funds with new financial institutions. As a result of the transfer of the Company s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the Company was in default, of its financial covenants under the 2022 Revolver. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of 0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. On August 4, 2023, we entered into a Default Waiver and First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement with the Lender, or the Amended 2022 Revolver, in which the Lender waived its rights and remedies against the Company and amended the 2022 Revolver. The Amended 2022 Revolver provides for a revolving line of credit of up to 10.0 million. The Company is permitted to make interest-only payments on the revolving line of credit through November 3, 2025, at which time all outstanding indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable. The outstanding principal amount of any advance shall accrue interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) four and one-half percent (4.50 and (ii) the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal for the relevant period minus one-half percent (0.50 ). The Company s obligations under the Amended 2022 Revolver are secured by substantially all of the Company s assets, excluding its intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. The revolving line of credit under the Amended 2022 Revolver terminates on November 3, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, there were no balances outstanding under the Amended 2022 Revolver. Pursuant to the Amended 2022 Revolver, the Lender waived filing any legal action or instituting or enforcing any rights and remedies it may have had against the Company in connection with the Company s failing to maintain all of its operating accounts, depository accounts and excess cash with the Lender, as previously required under the 2022 Revolver. The Company recorded a credit of 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to the previously recorded early termination penalties.

Table of Contents 
 The Amended 2022 Revolver also contains certain financial covenants, including a requirement that the Company maintain 20.0 million on account at or through the Lender and that the amount of unrestricted and unencumbered cash minus advances under the Amended 2022 Revolver, is not less than the amount equal to the greater of (i) 10.0 million or (ii) nine (9) months of cash burn. The Amended 2022 Revolver contains customary representations and warranties, as well as certain non-financial covenants, including limitations on, among other things, the Company s ability to change the principal nature of its business, dispose of the Company s business or property, engage in any change of control transaction, merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, incur additional indebtedness or liens, pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock, redeem the Company s capital stock, engage in transactions with affiliates or otherwise encumber the Company s intellectual property, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. We may seek additional funding through private or public equity financings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, channel partner or licensing arrangements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants, in addition to our existing covenants, restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt or potentially limiting our ability to obtain new debt financing or the refinance of our existing debt. Any debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not have or are not able to obtain sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a further discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Report on Form 10-K. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act for this reporting period and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We acquired RedWave Technology on April 29, 2024. The financial results of RedWave Technology are included in our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the quarter then ended. As this acquisition occurred in the second quarter of 2024, the scope of our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting does not include RedWave Technology. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of our assessment in the year such business is acquired. Other than the foregoing, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
