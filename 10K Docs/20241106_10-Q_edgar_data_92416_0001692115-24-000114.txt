In the first quarter of 2023, management identified a misstatement related to its accounting for the cost of gas sold at Southwest, thereby determining that Net cost of gas sold was overstated in 2021 and 2022 by million and million, respectively. Southwest made an adjustment in the first quarter of 2023 to reduce Net cost of gas sold and to increase its asset balance for Deferred purchased gas costs by million. 
 Also in the first quarter of 2023, the Company identified an approximately million misstatement related to its initial estimation of the loss recorded upon reclassifying MountainWest as an asset held for sale during the year ended December 31, 2022. Consequently, the impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was understated by approximately million, which was corrected in the first quarter of 2023. 
 The Company (and Southwest, with respect to Net cost of gas sold) assessed, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the impact of these items on previously issued financial statements, concluding they were not material to any earlier period or to the period of correction.

 Noncontrolling Interest . In connection with the Centuri IPO, the Company recorded a noncontrolling intere st as part of equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (associated with the interests held by the new investors in Centuri), and recognized the excess of the fair value of the Centuri IPO proceeds over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest, in addition to a portion of Accumulated other comprehensive loss relevant to the proportional interest of the noncontrolling parties in Centuri, within Additional paid-in capital. The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include multiple components of comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests following the Centuri IPO. These amounts, including those distinguishable from net income attributed to these parties, are separately presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity. Refer also to Note 8 - Centuri Separation . 
 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests . Separate from the noncontrolling ownership interests in Centuri, in connection with the earlier acquisition of Linetec, by Centuri, in November 2018, the previous Linetec owner initially retained a equity interest in that entity, with redemption of that interest being subject to certain rights based on the passage of time or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. Effective in 2022, the Company, through Centuri, had the right, but not the obligation, to purchase at fair value (subject to a floor) a portion of the interest held by the previous Linetec owner, and in incremental amounts each year thereafter. In March 2022, the parties agreed to a partial redemption, reducing the noncontrolling interest to , and in March 2023, agreed to a partial redemption (of the then remaining). In April 2023, Centuri paid million to the previous Linetec owner, thereby reducing the balance continuing to be redeemable at that time to under the terms of the original agreement. In March 2024, the parties entered into an agreement to redeem the remaining equity interest for million, which resulted in Centuri owning all of the equity interest in Linetec as of March 31, 2024. Centuri paid the total amount payable under the terms of the redemption agreement in April 2024. 
 Separately, certain members of Riggs Distler management hold a interest in Drum Parent, Inc. Drum ), the parent of Riggs Distler, which is redeemable, subject to certain rights based on the passage of time or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. A portion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was funded through promissory notes made to noncontrolling interest holders bearing interest at the prime rate plus . 
 During the first quarter of 2024, Centuri forgave all outstanding promissory notes and unpaid interest owed from the Riggs Distler noncontrolling interest holders and in exchange, obtained a portion of the equity interest in Drum that had been funded through these notes. This comprises most of the change noted below as redemption of Drum interests during the first nine months of 2024. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, Centuri reached an agreement to purchase of the noncontrolling interest in Drum for million, the majority of which was accrued in March 2024 and ultimately paid in April 2024.

 Southwest s effective tax rate was for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to for the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to pre-tax income differences, the amortization of excess deferred income taxes, and the impacts of COLI. Southwest s effective tax rate was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to in the corresponding period in 2023 primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and COLI. 
 In April 2023, the Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether expenditures to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized for tax purposes. The Company intends to adopt this change in tax accounting method with its 2024 U.S. federal income tax return filing in 2025, and it expects the safe harbor method to increase tax repair deductions. The effects of the change in method are not expected to be material to the financial statements overall, as this change will result in an increase in a deferred tax liability offset by a net operating loss position deferred tax asset.

 Revenue earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings Amounts billed in excess of revenue earned on contracts 
 Revenue earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings (contract assets) that are not expected to be invoiced and collected within a year from the financial statement date are not included in the table above, and were million as of September 30, 2024, and million as of December 31, 2023. These non-current balances were included in Deferred charges and other assets on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 These contract assets primarily relate to Centuri s rights to consideration for work completed, but not billed and/or approved for billing at the reporting date, and are transferred to contracts receivable when the rights become unconditional. The amounts billed in excess of revenue earned primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for which work has not yet been completed. The decrease in the contract liability balance from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 of million was due to revenue recognized during the period, net of new payments received in advance of work performed. 
 For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, Centuri uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not consider/compute an interest component based on the time value of money. Furthermore, because of the short duration of these contracts, Centuri has not disclosed the transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of the end of each reporting period or when the Company expects to recognize the revenue. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Centuri had fixed price contracts with an original duration of more than one year. The aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations of these contracts as of September 30, 2024 was million. Centuri expects to recognize the remaining performance obligations over approximately the next ; however, the timing of that recognition is largely within the control of the customer, including when the necessary materials required to complete the work are provided by the customer.

million credit facility that was otherwise scheduled to expire in April 2025. However, in August 2024, Southwest entered into a new agreement to replace its existing credit facility. The agreement extends the maturity date to August 2029 and makes other miscellaneous changes, while the operation, designations, and key business terms are comparable to the prior facility. In regard to the facility in place as of September 2024, Southwest has designated million of associated capacity as long-term debt and the remaining million for working capital purposes. At September 30, 2024, the applicable margin is for loans bearing interest with reference to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and for loans bearing interest with reference to the alternative base rate. At September 30, 2024, borrowings were outstanding on the long-term portion (including under the commercial paper program), nor under the short-term portion of the facility. 
 Centuri has a billion secured revolving credit and term loan multi-currency facility. Amounts can be borrowed in either Canadian or U.S. dollars. The revolving credit facility matures on August 27, 2026 and the term loan facility matures on August 27, 2028. On May 13, 2024, Centuri amended its revolving credit facility to transition from Canadian Dollar Offered Rate benchmarks to Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA ). The applicable margin for the revolving credit facility ranges from to for SOFR and CORRA loans and from to for base rate loans, depending on Centuri s total net leverage ratio. The applicable margin for the term loan facility is for base rate loans and for SOFR loans. The capacity of the line of credit portion of the facility is million; related amounts borrowed and repaid are available to be re-borrowed. The term loan portion of the facility has a limit of billion. Centuri s assets securing the facility at September 30, 2024 totaled billion. At September 30, 2024, million in borrowings were outstanding under Centuri s combined secured revolving credit and term loan facility. 
 On March 22, 2024, Centuri amended the financial covenants of its revolving credit facility and was required to maintain certain net leverage ratios. However, the amendment also provided that, in the event that a Qualified IPO (as defined in the amendment) is consummated prior to March 31, 2025, the maximum net leverage ratio would be reduced based on the amount of net proceeds received from such Qualified IPO. Pursuant to these terms, the completion of the Centuri IPO (which constituted a Qualified IPO for purposes of the amendment) resulted in a change to the maximum net leverage ratio. Based on the amount of proceeds received, Centuri was required to maintain a net leverage ratio of less than a maximum of to 1.00 from April 18, 2024 through June 30, 2024, to 1.00 from July 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024, to 1.00 from September 30, 2024 through December 29, 2024, and to 1.00 on December 30, 2024 and thereafter. The terms of the Centuri credit facility otherwise remain unchanged. Following the Centuri IPO and private placement, Centuri used approximately million of proceeds to pay down million of debt under the existing line of credit and million of debt under the term loan portion of the facility, with the remainder of the IPO proceeds used for general corporate purposes.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that owns all of the shares of common stock of Southwest Gas Corporation Southwest or the natural gas distribution segment), until April 22, 2024, all of the shares of common stock of Centuri Group, Inc. (the utility infrastructure services segment), and until February 14, 2023, all of the shares of common stock of MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company MountainWest ). Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company. References to Centuri relate to Centuri Group, Inc., for periods prior to April 22, 2024, or subsequently, to Centuri Holdings, Inc. 
 In December 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the Board unanimously determined to take strategic actions to simplify the Company s portfolio of businesses. These actions included entering into a definitive agreement to sell 100 of MountainWest in an all-cash transaction that closed on February 14, 2023. Additionally, the Company determined it would pursue a separation of Centuri, including forming a new independent publicly traded utility infrastructure services company. 
 In April 2024, the Company and Centuri Holdings, Inc. announced the completion of an initial public offering IPO of Centuri s common stock, with the issuance of 14,260,000 shares 0.01 par value) at a price of 21.00 per share, along with a concurrent private placement of 2,591,929 shares, at a price equal to the IPO price, with Icahn Partners LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund LP, investment entities associated with Carl C. Icahn. The Company owns approximately 81 of Centuri following these events. Through the first quarter of 2024 and leading up to the IPO, Centuri was a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. The net proceeds to Centuri from the IPO and the concurrent private placement totaled approximately 328 million, including optional purchase of IPO shares from underwriters. The Company intends to further reduce its ownership interest in future periods by means of: sales of its remaining Centuri shares into the market, a distribution of Centuri shares to Company stockholders, an exchange of Centuri shares for Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. shares, or a combination thereof. 
 Our business includes Southwest, which is engaged in the business of purchasing, distributing, and transporting natural gas for customers in portions of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Southwest is the largest regulated distributor of natural gas in Arizona and Nevada, and also distributes and transports natural gas for customers in portions of California. Additionally, through its subsidiaries, Southwest operates two regulated interstate pipelines serving portions of Nevada and California. Southwest makes investments in infrastructure to support customer demand associated with population growth and economic development activity and the safe and reliable operation of its system through adherence to integrity management programs. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Southwest had 2,248,000 residential, commercial, industrial, and other natural gas customers, of which 1,205,000 customers were located in Arizona, 837,000 in Nevada, and 206,000 in California. Over the past twelve months, first-time meter sets were approximately 41,000, comparable to the number of new meter sets during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Residential and small commercial customers represented over 99 of the total customer base. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, 53 of operating margin (Regulated operations revenues less the net cost of gas sold) was earned in Arizona, 35 in Nevada, and 12 in California. During this same period, Southwest earned 86 of its operating margin from residential and small commercial customers, 4 from other sales customers, and 10 from transportation customers. These patterns are expected to remain materially consistent for the foreseeable future. 
 Southwest recognizes operating revenues from the distribution and transportation of natural gas (and related services) to customers. Operating margin is a financial measure defined by management as Regulated operations revenues less the net cost of gas sold. However, operating margin is not specifically defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). Thus, operating margin is considered a non-GAAP measure. Management uses this financial measure because Regulated operations revenues include the net cost of gas sold, which is a tracked cost that is passed through to customers without markup under purchased gas adjustment PGA mechanisms. Fluctuations in the net cost of gas sold impact revenues on a dollar-for-dollar basis, but do not impact operating margin or operating income. Therefore, management believes operating margin provides investors and other interested parties with useful and relevant information to analyze Southwest s financial performance in a rate-regulated environment. The principal factors affecting changes in operating margin are general rate relief (including impacts of infrastructure trackers) and customer growth. Commission decisions on the amount and timing of relief may impact our earnings. Refer to the Summary Operating Results table below for a reconciliation of gross margin to operating margin, and refer to Rates and Regulatory Proceedings, in this Management s Discussion and Analysis, for details of various rate proceedings. 
 The demand for natural gas is seasonal, with greater demand in the colder winter months and decreased demand in the warmer summer months. All of Southwest s service territories have decoupled rate structures (alternative revenue programs), which are designed to eliminate the direct link between volumetric sales and revenue, thereby mitigating the impacts of weather

variability and conservation on operating margin, allowing Southwest to pursue energy efficiency initiatives. Nearly all of our customers, and resulting revenue and margin, are included as part of mechanisms that reduce the impact of weather and volume variability on our earnings. 
 Centuri is a strategic infrastructure services company that partners with regulated utilities to build and maintain the energy network that fuels millions of homes and businesses across the United States U.S. and Canada. With a commitment to serve as long-term partners to customers and communities, Centuri s employees enable regulated utilities to sa fely and reliably deliver natural gas and electricity, as well as achieve their goals for environmental sustainability. Centuri operates in 88 primary locations across 45 states and provinces in the U.S. and Canada. It operates in the U.S., primarily as NPL, Ne uco, Linetec, and Riggs Distler, and in Canada, primarily as NPL Canada. 
 Utility infrastructure services activity can be impacted by changes in infrastructure replacement programs and capital budgets of utilities, weather, and local and federal regulation (including tax rates and incentives). Utilities continue to implement or modify system integrity management programs to enhance safety pursuant to federal and state mandates. These programs have resulted in multi-year utility system replacement projects throughout the U.S. Likewise, there has been similar attention placed on electric grid modernization through national infrastructure legislation and related initiatives. Generally, Centuri revenues are lowest during the first quarter of the year due to less favorable winter weather conditions. Revenues typically improve as more favorable weather conditions occur during the summer and fall months. In cases of severe weather, such as following a regional storm, Centuri may be engaged to perform restoration activities related to above-ground utility infrastructure, and related results impacts are not solely within the control of management. In addition, in certain circumstances, such as with large bid contracts (especially those of a longer duration), or unit-price contracts with revenue caps, results may be impacted by differences between costs incurred and those anticipated when the work was originally bid. Work awarded, or failing to be awarded, by individual large customers can impact operating results. 
 All of our businesses may be impacted by economic conditions that impact businesses generally, such as inflationary impacts on goods and services consumed in the business, rising or sustained high interest rates, labor markets and costs (including in regard to contracted or professional services), and the availability of those resources. Certain of these impacts may be more predominant in certain of our operations, such as with regard to fuel costs for work equipment and skilled/trade labor costs at Centuri.

 Results from natural gas distribution operations improved 3.8 million between the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in Operating margin and Other income, offset by an increase in Operations and maintenance expense, Depreciation and amortization, and net interest deductions. 
 Operating margin increased 22.9 million quarter over quarter. Combined rate relief in Nevada and California added approximately 16 million of incremental margin, and an additional 2 million was attributable to customer growth, including approximately 41,000 first-time meter sets during the last twelve months. The combined impacts of increases in recovery/return associated with regulatory account balances 1 million), and the variable interest expense adjustment mechanism in Nevada 2 million) (for which amortization is recognized in interest expense), also resulted in incremental margin between comparable periods. The remaining variance primarily relates to changes in other miscellaneous revenue and revenue from customers outside of the decoupling mechanisms. 
 Operations and maintenance expense increased 7.5 million or 6 between quarters. General cost increases (net of amounts capitalized in Gas plant, where relevant, to support construction efforts) were experienced in a variety of areas, including 3.2 million (combined) of incremental labor-related and benefit costs, including incentive compensation costs, 1.6 million (combined) of incremental leak survey and line locating costs, 1.1 million of higher insurance costs, and 1.2 million of increased reserves for customer accounts deemed uncollectible. These increases, and others, were partially offset by a reduction in certain external contractor and professional services expenses. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.9 million, or 7 , between quarters, primarily due to a 755 million, or 8 increase in average gas plant in service since the corresponding third quarter of 2023, in addition to 1 million of increased amortization related to regulatory account balances. The increase in plant was attributable to pipeline capacity reinforcement work, franchise requirements, scheduled pipe replacement activities, and new infrastructure. 
 Other income (which is net of other deductions) increased 2.1 million between quarters. The increase was primarily driven by a 4.7 million increase in values associated with company-owned life insurance COLI policies and a 1.9 million increase in the equity portion of the allowance for funds used during construction. Offsetting these increases was a 1 million increase in non-service-related costs associated with employee pension and other postretirement benefits and a 4.5 million decrease in interest income primarily reflecting a reduction in carrying charges associated with regulatory account balances, notably, deferred purchased gas cost balances, which, on a combined basis, decreased from an asset balance of 687 million as of September 30, 2023 to a net liability balance of 180 million as of September 30, 2024. Interest is earned when balances are assets and interest expense is incurred when balances are liabilities. 
 Net interest deductions increased approximately 6.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the regulatory treatment associated with Southwest s industrial development revenue bonds (the variable interest expense mechanism noted above), which incorporates the impacts of deferrals and return/recoveries. Surcharges/surcredits associated with the mechanism are included in revenue/operating margin when included in customer rates; however, related regulatory account amortization is reflected in interest expense. Additionally contributing to the increase was interest 
 
 31 

incurred on the over-collected balance of the PGA, and a lower level of debt-related allowance for funds used during construction AFUDC ). By its nature, debt-related AFUDC is recognized as a reduction/offset to interest expense; however, such offsetting amounts were lower in the third quarter of 2024 (more pronounced in the third quarter of 2023), thereby increasing interest expense between comparative periods. 
 
 Results of Natural Gas Distribution 
 Nine-Month Analysis 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Thousands of dollars) 2024 2023 Regulated operations revenues 1,922,157 1,797,348 Net cost of gas sold 984,188 902,278 Operating margin 937,969 895,070 Operations and maintenance expense 390,229 378,189 Depreciation and amortization 220,663 218,763 Taxes other than income taxes 66,414 65,491 Operating income 260,663 232,627 Other income 48,976 51,722 Net interest deductions 118,595 111,498 Income before income taxes 191,044 172,851 Income tax expense 27,053 22,286 Contribution to consolidated results 163,991 150,565 
 Results from natural gas distribution operations improved approximately 13 million between the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The improvement was primarily due to an increase in Operating margin, offset by an increase in Operations and maintenance expense and Net interest deductions. 
 Operating margin increased 43 million period over period. Approximately 9 million of incremental margin was attributable to customer growth, including approximately 41,000 first-time meter sets during the last twelve months. Combined rate relief across all our service territories added approximately 44 million of incremental margin. Favorable impacts 6.4 million, combined) were also realized in connection with certain rate components of infrastructure trackers and the Nevada variable interest expense mechanism. Furthermore, late fee assessments on customer account balances provided approximately 3 million in incremental margin. Offsetting these increases was a decrease in recoveries associated with other regulatory programs, totaling 8.6 million, for which an associated comparable decrease is also reflected in amortization expense (discussed below). In addition, an 8 million out-of-period favorable gas cost adjustment in the prior-year period did not recur in 2024. Customary gas used in operations (the effects of which are offset in Operations and maintenance expense) also reduced operating margin 3.8 million) in the current period. Changes in miscellaneous revenue and customers outside of the decoupling mechanisms comprise the remaining variance. 
 Operations and maintenance expense increased 12 million, or 3 , between periods. General cost increases (net of amounts capitalized in Gas plant, where relevant, to support construction efforts), were experienced in a variety of areas, including 7.6 million of (combined) incremental employee labor-related and benefit costs, including incentive compensation costs, 5.3 million (combined) of incremental leak survey and line locating costs, and 2 million in higher insurance costs. These increases, along with others, were partially offset by impacts from the cost of fuel used in operations as noted above and a reduction in other contractor and professional services. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 1.9 million, or 1 , between periods, due primarily to an increase in depreciation on gas plant, reflective of a 710 million, or 7 , increase in average gas plant in service since the corresponding period of 2023. The increase in plant was attributable to pipeline capacity reinforcement work, franchise requirements, scheduled pipe replacement activities, and new infrastructure. This increase was largely offset by a decrease of 8.6 million in amortization associated with the recovery of regulatory program balances (noted earlier), including a sizeable difference in the amount of the California Climate Credit between periods. 
 Other income (which is net of other deductions) decreased approximately 2.7 million. Interest income declined 12.6 million between periods primarily reflecting a reduction to carrying charges associated with regulatory account balances, notably, deferred purchased gas cost balances, which decreased from an asset balance of 687 million as of September 30, 2023 to a net 
 
 32 

liability balance of 180 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, non-service-related costs associated with employee pension and other postretirement benefits increased by 3 million. Offsetting these was a 5.5 million increase in the equity portion of the allowance for funds used during construction, a 3 million increase in values associated with COLI policies (the comparative prior-year period also included net death benefits), and 3.8 million related to nonrecoverable software write-offs and market adjustments on other property in the prior year period that did not recur in 2024. 
 Net interest deductions increased 7.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the prior-year period, including the impacts of the regulatory treatment associated with Southwest s industrial development revenue bonds, and due to a lower level of debt-related AFUDC, which had the impact of increasing interest expense on a relative basis in 2024. Offsetting these impacts was a decrease in interest related to the payoff in April 2023 of a 450 million term loan. 
 
 Results of Utility Infrastructure Services 
 Quarterly Analysis 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (Thousands of dollars) 2024 2023 Utility infrastructure services revenues 720,053 774,889 Operating expenses: Utility infrastructure services expenses 644,928 685,687 Depreciation and amortization 33,208 36,252 Operating income 41,917 52,950 Other income (deductions) 160 108 Net interest deductions 23,925 26,131 Income before income taxes 18,152 26,927 Income tax expense 5,822 8,235 Net income 12,330 18,692 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,374 736 Contribution to consolidated results 9,956 17,956 
 Utility infrastructure services revenues decreased 54.8 million, or 7 , in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by decreased gas utility infrastructure services Gas revenues of 33.9 million and decreased electric utility infrastructure services Electric revenues of 14.3 million. The decrease in Gas revenues was primarily due to a reduction in net volumes under existing master services agreements MSAs ). The decrease in Electric revenues was primarily due to a decrease in offshore wind revenues of 38 million compared to the prior-year period, partially offset by an increase in emergency restoration services revenue of approximately 22.5 million. 
 Utility infrastructure services expenses decreased 40.8 million, or 6 , in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the prior-year quarter due primarily to a lower volume of infrastructure services provided. Subcontractor costs, a significant component of these expenses, decreased during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to decreased work under offshore wind projects and changes in the mix of work. Profit margin in the third quarter of 2024 also decreased on a relative basis, primarily due to lower margins on bid work (as the prior year quarter benefited from a highly profitable project bid that did not recur in the current quarter), decreased volumes on MSAs leading to underutilization of fixed costs, and unfavorable changes in the mix of work. Included in total Utility infrastructure services expenses were general and administrative costs, which increased approximately 0.6 million between quarters. Gains on sale of equipment in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 (reflected as an offset to Utility infrastructure services expenses) were approximately 0.7 million and 1.1 million, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 3 million between periods, primarily due to a number of small tools within Electric operations becoming fully depreciated in 2023 and not requiring replacement based on project needs. Additionally, more efficient utilization of existing fixed assets in recent periods has slowed the growth of the depreciable asset base, with capital expenditures of 106.6 million in 2023 compared to capital expenditures of 130.2 million in 2022, which impacted depreciation on a relative basis in the periods following. 
 The decrease in net interest deductions of 2.2 million between quarters was primarily due to a reduction in the average debt balance, as Centuri paid down 156 million of debt under its revolving credit facility and 160 million of debt under its term loan facility with proceeds from its April 2024 IPO and private placement.

Income tax expense decreased 2.4 million between quarters, primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income in 2024. 
 
 Results of Utility Infrastructure Services 
 Nine-Month Analysis 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (Thousands of dollars) 2024 2023 Utility infrastructure services revenues 1,920,151 2,233,961 Operating expenses: Utility infrastructure services expenses 1,765,116 2,005,084 Depreciation and amortization 101,912 110,982 Operating income 53,123 117,895 Other income (deductions) 900 311 Net interest deductions 70,653 73,032 Income (loss) before income taxes (16,630) 45,174 Income tax expense 514 16,416 Net income (loss) (17,144) 28,758 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 4,076 3,856 Contribution to consolidated results (21,220) 24,902 
 Utility infrastructure services revenues decreased 313.8 million, or 14 , in the first nine months of 2024 when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year driven primarily by decreases in Electric revenues of 163.2 million, and 129.6 million in Gas revenues. The decline in Electric revenues was primarily due to a net reduction in volumes under MSAs, as well as a decrease in offshore wind revenues of 71.4 million compared to the prior-year period. Included in Electric revenue was 87 million from emergency restoration services following storm damage to customers above-ground utility infrastructure throughout the U.S. during 2024, compared to 83.4 million in emergency restoration services in the prior year. The decrease in Gas revenues was primarily due to a reduction in net volumes under existing customer MSAs and timing of bid projects, as the prior year benefited from the commencement of a large project that has since been completed. 
 Utility infrastructure services expenses decreased 240 million, or 12 , between periods. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume of infrastructure services provided overall. Subcontractor costs, a significant component of these expenses, decreased during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to decreased work under offshore wind projects and changes in mix of work. Profit margin also decreased on a relative basis in the current period as compared to the prior period, due to lower margins on bid work, decreased volumes leading to underutilization of fixed costs, and unfavorable changes in the mix of work. General and administrative costs included in total utility infrastructure services expenses decreased approximately 3.9 million between comparative periods, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and lower corporate salary and benefit costs during the current period, partially offset by an increase in one-time severance cost. Gains on sale of equipment (reflected as an offset to Utility infrastructure services expenses) were approximately 2.7 million and 3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 9.1 million between the current and prior-year nine-month periods, primarily due to a number of small tools within Electric operations becoming fully depreciated in 2023 and not requiring replacement based on project needs. Additionally, more efficient utilization of existing fixed assets in recent periods has slowed the growth of the depreciable asset base, with capital expenditures of 106.6 million in 2023 compared to capital expenditures of 130.2 million in 2022. 
 The decrease in net interest deductions of 2.4 million between the current and prior-year nine-month periods was primarily due to a reduction in the average debt balance, as Centuri paid down 156 million of debt under its revolving credit facility and 160 million of debt under its term loan facility with proceeds from its April 2024 IPO and private placement. 
 Income tax expense decreased by 15.9 million between periods, primarily due to reduced pre-tax income during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024.

Rates and Regulatory Proceedings 
 Southwest is subject to the regulation of the Arizona Corporation Commission ACC ), the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (the PUCN ), and the California Public Utilities Commission (the CPUC ), and two of Southwest s subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the FERC ). 
 Arizona Jurisdiction 
 Arizona General Rate Case. Southwest filed its 2024 Arizona rate case application in early February 2024, proposing an increase in revenue of approximately 126 million to reflect the continued significant capital investments in the state and to update rates to more closely align with Southwest s current level of operations and maintenance expense. The request included a return on common equity of 10.15 and a 0.81 fair value increment, relative to a 50 target equity ratio and a proposed twelve-month post-test year adjustment for non-revenue producing plant. In addition to proposing the continuation of full revenue decoupling under the Delivery Charge Adjustment DCA mechanism, Southwest proposed the establishment of a System Improvement Benefit SIB mechanism, a capital tracker designed to support required code and regulatory-related infrastructure replacements. Southwest also proposed to set the carrying cost for the interest component of the DCA and Gas Cost Balancing Account GCBA rate adjustment mechanisms to equal the Commission-authorized Weighted Average Cost of Capital, and to establish an Unrecovered Gas Cost Expense Provision UGCE ), which represents the gas cost-related portion of net write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts. The UGCE would allow Southwest to more timely recover commodity and related components of such accounts. While testimony has been filed by the Utilities Division Staff of the ACC and intervenors in the case, management can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome. Additional testimony dates and hearings are scheduled for late November 2024. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2025, with new rates anticipated to become effective in the second quarter of 2025. Southwest s existing general rates became effective February 1, 2023 following the conclusion of the previous general rate case. 
 Delivery Charge Adjustment. The DCA, or Arizona decoupling mechanism, as described above, includes a filing each April, which along with other reporting requirements, contemplates a rate to return/recover the over- or under-collected margin balance. The existing rate to return the over-collected balance of 17.5 million existing as of March 31, 2024 was approved and became effective August 1, 2024. 
 Tax Reform. A Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism TEAM was approved in Southwest s 2019 general rate case to timely recognize tax rate changes resulting from federal or state tax legislation following the TEAM implementation. In addition, the TEAM tracks and returns/recovers the revenue requirement impact of changes in the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes EADIT ), including that which resulted from 2017 U.S. federal tax reform, compared to the amount authorized in the most recently concluded rate case. Following the inaugural surcredit rate establishment under the TEAM mechanism in December 2022, Southwest has filed subsequent TEAM rate applications, including a recent filing, which proposed to update the TEAM surcredit to refund 5 million of additional estimated EADIT. The adjusted rate became effective June 1, 2024. 
 Customer-Owned Yard Line COYL Program . Southwest originally received approval, in connection with its 2010 Arizona general rate case, to implement a program to conduct leak surveys, and if leaks were present, to replace and relocate service lines and meters for Arizona customers whose meters were placed away from the customer s home, representing a non-traditional configuration. The COYL program has been subject to proceedings to recover investments since that time. In February 2024, Southwest requested approval to recover the outstanding revenue requirement of approximately 1.8 million associated with 2023 COYL investments. The adjusted rate became effective June 15, 2024. 
 PGA Modification . On March 1, 2023, Southwest filed a request to adjust the interest rate applicable to the outstanding Purchased Gas Adjustment PGA balance to more closely match the interest expense incurred to finance the balance. In the alternative, the filing requested an expansion of the current GCBA adjustment to clear the balance then existing. In July 2023, the ACC approved an increase to the GCBA rate (over a two-year period) effective August 1, 2023, to support the timely recovery of the approximately 358 million balance as of May 31, 2023. The increased GCBA was authorized to remain in place for up to two years or until the balance dropped below 10 million. The GCBA rate was later set to 0.00 per therm, effective October 1, 2024, where it will remain until the under- or over-collected balance exceeds 10 million. The ongoing deferred energy rates, separate from the GCBA rates, continue to be updated monthly.

Nevada Jurisdiction 
 Nevada General Rate Case . Southwest filed its most recent general rate case in September 2023 based on the test year ended May 2023. The initial request was updated with a certification filing primarily for plant placed in service and incremental annual leak survey costs through November 2023. Those updates resulted in an updated overall request of 74 million, an increase over the initial request of 69.8 million. A stipulation was reached with Regulatory Operations Staff and the Bureau of Consumer Protection, settling certain issues, and agreeing to a black box settlement with a statewide increase of 65.6 million, before any adjustments for the cost of capital. Following a hearing on cost of capital issues, the PUCN issued a decision approving an annual increase in revenues of 59 million, approving the proposed settlement, and authorizing a return on common equity of 9.5 , including the use of a hypothetical capital structure of 50 debt and 50 equity. Included in the settled items were: a continuation of full revenue decoupling; authority to continue tracking incremental annual leak survey costs in a regulatory asset (discussed further below); and refreshed depreciation rates that are somewhat lower than proposed. New rates became effective in April 2024. 
 General Revenues Adjustment. The General Revenues Adjustment GRA ), or Nevada decoupling mechanism, was affirmed as part of Southwest s most recently concluded general rate case and adjustments are included in the Annual Rate Adjustment ARA filings intended to update rates to recover/return amounts associated with various regulatory mechanisms, including the GRA. Southwest made its most recent ARA filing in November 2023 related to the approximate 8.7 million over-collected GRA balance as of September 30, 2023. Recovery of rates and adjustments thereto as part of the ARA primarily impact cash flows, but not net income overall. Updated rates for the GRA and other regulatory mechanisms included in the ARA filing became effective May 1, 2024, earlier than the typical July 1, 2024 effective date. The next ARA filing will be made in November 2024, considering balances as of September 30, 2024. Updated rates are anticipated July 1, 2025. 
 Nevada Leak Survey. In 2019, the PUCN opened an Investigation and Rulemaking action to consider certain amendments to the Nevada Administrative Code requiring annual leak surveys of distribution pipelines transporting natural gas or liquid petroleum. The increased survey activity was to focus on business districts and to be conducted generally on an annual basis (not exceeding 15-month survey intervals). The proposed regulations were permanently adopted effective January 1, 2023. Regulatory asset treatment was approved for the purpose of tracking incremental costs associated with implementing the increased leak surveys. Continuation of the program, along with recovery of earlier incurred amounts over a two-year period, was approved in conjunction with Southwest s recently completed general rate case. 
 California Jurisdiction 
 California General Rate Case. Southwest filed its most recent general rate case in September 2024 related to a future test year (2026), proposing a statewide revenue increase of approximately 49 million, consisting of a revenue increase of 38.5 million for the southern California rate jurisdiction, an increase of 63,000 for the northern California rate jurisdiction, and an increase of 10.2 million for the South Lake Tahoe rate jurisdiction. The request is based on a capital structure consisting of 50 long-term debt and 50 common equity with a requested return on common equity of 11.35 , a modest increase to the 11.16 currently authorized. A continuation of Southwest s Post Test Year PTY margin attrition adjustment for attrition years 2027 2030 is included, as well as continued use of the Automatic Trigger Mechanism in lieu of annual cost of capital filings. Southwest s filing also includes a risk-based decision-making framework proposing the continuation of the Targeted Pipe Replacement Program, the Meter Protection Program, and COYL Program, along with the addition of a new Annual Leak Survey Program, collectively under the Infrastructure Reliability and Replacement Adjustment Mechanism umbrella. Authority to establish a Damage Prevention Cost Balancing Account to record and recover (or return) certain costs associated with damage prevention expenses, specifically those related to line locating activities, was also requested. Consolidation of Southwest s northern California and South Lake Tahoe rate jurisdictions into a single rate-making jurisdiction is also proposed. The rate case will be processed during 2025 with a final decision expected in the fourth quarter of 2025, and new rates are expected to be effective in January 2026. 
 Attrition Filing. Following the 2021 implementation of rates approved as part of the previous general rate case, the continuation of annual PTY margin attrition increases of 2.75 began in January 2022. The most recent increase included the attrition component, along with adjustments related to the amortization of EADIT, the impact of the Automatic Trigger Mechanism on authorized rate base, and margin associated with the North Lake Tahoe Lateral replacement project. The Automatic Trigger Mechanism adjusts the rate of return up or down (in this case, up) as a result of changes in the average utility bond yield that exceed 100 basis points. The cumulative impact resulted in an annual increase of 11.6 million effective January 2024 for Southwest s combined southern California, northern California, and South Lake Tahoe rate jurisdictions. The PTY increase of 4.7 million associated with the North Lake Tahoe Lateral revenue requirement became effective February 1, 2024. 
 Service Area Extension. Southwest filed a request to expand its southern California certificated service area, a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity CPCN ), to include the Army s National Training Center at Fort Irwin, located northeast 
 
 36 

of Barstow, California. The CPCN was approved by the CPUC in April 2024 and authorizes Southwest to construct approximately 21 miles of distribution main pipeline to deliver natural gas service to the newly certificated area of Fort Irwin, which at the time of filing was estimated to cost approximately 38.7 million. 
 FERC Jurisdiction 
 General Rate Case. Great Basin Gas Transmission Company Great Basin ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest, filed notice of a change in rates (pursuant to applicable regulations) on March 6, 2024, requesting that rates for natural gas service subject to the filing be made effective April 6, 2024. The FERC, however, suspended the case for a five-month period, which allowed rates to go into effect, subject to refund, on September 6, 2024. The filing included a request to continue a term-differentiated rate structure which was adopted as part of Great Basin s previous general rate case, provide an overall annual revenue increase of approximately 16 million, and a return on equity of 14.05 and 13.05 applicable to each category of shippers, as applicable, and a capital structure of 44 long-term debt and 56 common equity. A primary driver of the proposed increase was approximately 99 million of capital investments, much of which was placed in service by the end of the August 31, 2024 test year. Motion rates, subject to refund, became effective in September 2024, with an initial decision expected during the second quarter of 2025. A portion of the rates implemented subject to refund will be appropriately reserved pending the final outcome in the case. 
 PGA Filings 
 The rate schedules in all of Southwest s service territories contain provisions that permit adjustment to rates as the cost of purchased gas changes. These deferred energy provisions and purchased gas adjustment clauses are collectively referred to as PGA clauses. Differences between gas costs recovered from customers and amounts paid for gas by Southwest result in over- or under-collections. Balances are recovered from or refunded to customers on an ongoing basis with interest. As of September 30, 2024, under-collections in California resulted in an asset of approximately 9.3 million and over-collections in Arizona and southern and northern Nevada resulted in a liability of approximately 189 million on the Company s and Southwest s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The substantial reduction in balances between periods in the table below reflects a combination of specific recovery rates in place to collect the build-up of earlier balances as a result of the cost paid for gas in those earlier periods, and recent conditions whereby base rates under the mechanisms have exceeded the cost of recent gas supply purchases by Southwest. 
 Filings to change rates in accordance with PGA clauses are subject to audit by state regulatory commission staffs. PGA changes impact cash flows but have no direct impact on operating margin. However, gas cost deferrals and recoveries can impact comparisons between periods of individual consolidated income statement components. These include Regulated operations revenues, Net cost of gas sold, Net interest deductions, and Other income (deductions). 
 The following table presents Southwest s outstanding PGA balances receivable/(payable): 
 (Thousands of dollars) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Arizona (17,365) 251,416 301,321 Northern Nevada (32,153) 45,757 56,975 Southern Nevada (139,467) 218,761 294,624 California 9,270 36,951 34,217 (179,715) 552,885 687,137 
 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Historically, cash on hand and cash flows from operations have provided a substantial portion of cash used in investing activities (primarily for construction expenditures and property additions). In recent years, Southwest has undertaken significant pipe replacement activities to fortify system integrity and reliability, including on an accelerated basis in association with certain gas infrastructure replacement programs. In addition, certain national events, including several major storms in recent years affecting central portions of the U.S., contributed to the periodic run-up in gas supply costs, before commodity costs significantly dropped in more recent periods. This collective activity necessitated the issuance of both debt and equity securities to supplement cash flows from operations, before cash reserves built up at the utility in more recent periods, including from collections under the PGA mechanisms. Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and Southwest s capitalization strategy is to maintain an 
 
 37 

appropriate balance of equity and debt to preserve investment-grade credit ratings, which help minimize interest costs. Investment-grade credit ratings have been maintained by Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and Southwest. 
 Cash Flows 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.: 
 Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows provided by consolidated operating activities increased 956 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the collection of previously deferred purchased gas costs for Southwest. As noted above, in earlier periods rates billed to customers for gas supply costs were lower than actual expenditures. These differences were deferred and have since been collected, providing a significant source of available funds in the current period. The improvement in cash flows also reflects the impacts of changes in other components of working capital overall, including the timing and amount of accounts receivable/payable and other current asset and liability balances. 
 Investing Cash Flows. Cash flows from investing activities decreased 1.04 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The overall decrease was driven by 1.05 billion in proceeds received in connection with the MountainWest sale (net of cash sold) in 2023, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of other property in 2024. Outflows for construction expenditures and property additions were also higher in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Financing Cash Flows. Cash flows from consolidated financing activities increased 481 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The overall increase was primarily due to activity in 2023, including the first quarter 2023 repayment 1.1 billion) of the then remaining balance of the term loan entered into by Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. in connection with the 2021 acquisition of MountainWest, offset by Southwest s issuance of 300 million in 5.45 senior notes in March 2023 that will mature in 2028, as well as the Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. proceeds received in April 2023 from a 550 million term loan now maturing in July 2025, in addition to various other borrowing and repayment activity. Net financing activities in 2024 include net proceeds received from Centuri s April 2024 IPO and private placement 328 million), with the majority of the proceeds used by Centuri to pay down portions of its revolving credit and term loan facility. Financing cash flows also include Centuri s redemption of the previously remaining redeemable noncontrolling interest in Linetec for 92 million in 2024 (compared to 40 million of partial redemption in the comparable period in the prior year), in addition to utilization of its credit facility for this and other purposes. The prior year period also included proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in an underwritten public offering in March 2023, with no comparable issuance in the current year. Those proceeds were used at that time to pay down Company indebtedness. Other financing cash flows include borrowings and repayments under the companies credit facilities, and an increase in dividends paid between periods. 
 Corporate and administrative expenses/outflows for Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. in the first nine months of 2024 overall primarily include interest paid on outstanding borrowings and costs associated with the Centuri separation. Combined borrowing costs and other corporate and administrative expenses of the holding company were substantially higher in 2023, primarily related to the strategic process and sale of MountainWest in that year. 
 The capital requirements and resources of the Company generally are determi ned independently for the individual business segments. Each business segment is generally responsible for securing its own debt financing sources. However, the holding company may raise funds through stock issuances or other external financing sources in support of each business segment. 
 Southwest Gas Corporation: 
 Operating Cash Flows. Cash flows provided by operating activities increased approximately 926 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The improvement in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the collection of deferred purchased gas costs (as discussed above), as well as cash flows from other working capital changes overall. 
 Investing Cash Flows. Cash used in investing activities increased 39 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. While outflows for capital expenditures increased by 63 million between periods, the current period also reflects inflows from the sale of property, as well as reduced outflows related to customer advances for construction. See also Natural Gas Distribution Segment Construction Expenditures, Debt Maturities, and Financing below. 
 Financing Cash Flows. Net cash from financing activities decreased 576 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023. The decline was primarily due to activity in 2023, including proceeds from 300 million of 5.45 senior notes issued that year. Separately, parent contributions and term loan proceeds in 2023 exceeded short-term debt repayments (including of the term loan) that same year, with no similar comparable financing inflows in 2024. Outflows for dividend payments increased in the current period. Other impacts primarily relate to activity under Southwest s credit facility in 2023. See Note 5 Debt .

Natural Gas Distribution Segment Construction Expenditures, Debt Maturities, and Financing 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, construction expenditures for the natural gas distribution segment were 644 million. The majority of these expenditures, approximately 55 , were associated with the replacement of existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to fortify system integrity and reliability, as well as other general plant expenditures, with the remainder related to new construction. 
 Management estimates natural gas segment construction expenditures during the three-year period ending December 31, 2026 will be approximately 2.4 billion. Of this amount, approximately 830 million is expected to be incurred during calendar year 2024. Southwest plans to continue to request regulatory support to undertake projects, or to accelerate projects as necessary for the improvement of system flexibility and reliability, or to expand, where relevant, to unserved or underserved areas. Southwest may expand existing, or initiate new, programs. Significant replacement activities are expected to continue well beyond the next few years. See also Rates and Regulatory Proceedings . In August 2024, Southwest entered into a new credit facility to replace the existing credit facility that was otherwise set to expire in 2025; the new agreement includes similar terms to the existing facility, but the new agreement extends the maturity date to 2029. Otherwise, Southwest has 75 million of long-term debt maturing in 2026, but no debt maturities in either 2024 or 2025. Also during that same three-year period, cash flows from operating activities of Southwest are expected to provide approximately 78 of the funding for gas operations of Southwest and total construction expenditures and dividend requirements. Any additional cash requirements, including construction-related, and any paydown or refinancing of debt, are expected to be provided by existing credit facilities, parent equity contributions, and/or other external financing sources. The timing, types, and amounts of additional external financings will be dependent on a number of factors, including the cost of gas purchases, conditions in capital markets, timing and amount of rate relief, timing and amount of surcharge collections from, or amounts returned to, customers related to regulatory mechanisms and programs, as well as growth levels in Southwest s service areas and earnings. External financings may include the issuance of debt securities, bank and other short-term borrowings, and other forms of financing. 
 Dividend Policy 
 Dividends are payable on the Company s common stock at the discretion of the Board. In setting the dividend rate, the Board considers, among other factors, current and expected future earnings levels, our ongoing capital expenditure plans, expected external funding needs, our payout ratio, and our ability to maintain investment-grade credit ratings and liquidity. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1956. In February 2024, the Board determined to maintain the quarterly dividend at 0.62 per share, effective with the June 2024 payment. Although no assurances can be provided on our future dividend payments, the Board currently intends to reevaluate the dividend upon the completion of the Centuri separation, and it is anticipated that we will pay a dividend at a level consistent with industry peers. 
 Liquidity 
 Several factors (some of which are out of the control of the Company) that could significantly affect liquidity in the future include: variability of natural gas prices, changes in ratemaking policies of regulatory commissions, regulatory lag, customer growth in the natural gas distribution segment, the ability to access and obtain capital from external sources, interest rates, income tax laws and changes thereto, pension funding requirements, inflation, and the level of earnings. Natural gas prices and related gas cost recovery rates, as well as plant investment, have historically had the most significant impact on liquidity. 
 On an interim basis, Southwest defers over- or under-collections of gas costs to PGA balancing accounts. In addition, Southwest uses this mechanism to either refund amounts over-collected or recoup amounts under-collected as compared to the price paid for natural gas during the period since the last PGA rate change went into effect. At September 30, 2024, the balance in the PGA accounts included an under-collection of approximately 9.3 million pertaining to the California jurisdiction and an over-collection of 189 million pertaining to Arizona and Nevada. The substantial reduction in the PGA balance as of this date compared to balances existing in recently concluded and comparable earlier periods is also highlighted by the substantial cash balance of 402 million existing as of September 30, 2024. See PGA Filings for more information. 
 Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. has a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 300 million that expires in December 2026. This facility is intended for short-term financing needs. At September 30, 2024, 113 million was outstanding under this facility. 
 As described above, in April 2023, Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. entered into a 550 million Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Term Loan that was set to mature in October 2024. Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. utilized a majority of the proceeds to make an equity contribution to Southwest. In August 2024, the Company amended its Term Loan agreement, which extended the maturity date to July 31, 2025 and changed the interest with reference to SOFR from an applicable margin of 1.300 to 1.125 , among other miscellaneous changes.

Southwest has a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of 400 million, which was set to expire in April 2025, before it was replaced in August 2024, extending the maturity date to 2029. The operations, designations, and key business terms are comparable to the prior facility. Southwest designates 150 million of capacity under the facility for long-term borrowing needs and the remaining 250 million for working capital purposes. There was no activity on either the long-term or short-term portions of the existing facility during the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024. Additionally, at September 30, 2024, no borrowings were outstanding on either the long-term or short-term portions of the existing facility. The credit facility can be used as necessary to meet liquidity requirements, including temporarily financing under-collected PGA balances, or meeting the refund needs of over-collected balances. The credit facility in place has generally been adequate for Southwest s working capital needs outside of funds raised through operations and other types of external financing. Any additional cash requirements would include utilization of the credit facility, equity contributions from the Company, and/or other external financing sources. 
 Southwest has a 50 million commercial paper program. Any issuance under the commercial paper program is supported by Southwest s revolving credit facility and, therefore, does not represent additional borrowing capacity. Any borrowing under the commercial paper program is designated as long-term debt. Interest rates for the commercial paper program are calculated at the current commercial paper rate during the borrowing term. At September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under this program. 
 Centuri has a 1.545 billion secured revolving credit and term loan multi-currency facility. The capacity of the line of credit is 400 million, with related amounts borrowed and repaid being generally available to be re-borrowed; the term loan facility has a limit of 1.145 billion. The term loan facility expires on August 27, 2028 and the revolving credit facility expires on August 27, 2026. This multi-currency facility allows the borrower to request loan advances in either Canadian or U.S. dollars. The obligations under the credit agreement are secured by present and future ownership interests in substantially all direct and indirect subsidiaries of Centuri, substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property of each borrower, certain of their direct and indirect subsidiaries, and all products, profits, and proceeds of the foregoing. Centuri assets securing the facility at September 30, 2024 totaled 2.4 billion. The maximum amount outstanding on the combined facility during the first nine months of 2024 was 1.1 billion. As of September 30, 2024, 116 million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility, in addition to 731 million that was outstanding on the term loan portion of the facility. Also at September 30, 2024, there was approximately 218 million, net of letters of credit, available for borrowing under the line of credit. 
 In April 2024, Centuri successfully completed an IPO of 14,260,000 shares of Centuri common stock at a price of 21.00 per share, in addition to a concurrent private placement of 2,591,929 shares at a price equal to the IPO price. The collective net proceeds to Centuri approximated 328 million. Centuri used 316 million of the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit and term loan facility, with the remainder intended for general corporate purposes. Following the IPO, the Company owns approximately 81 of the outstanding shares of Centuri common stock. The Company intends to further reduce its ownership in Centuri in future periods through: sales of its remaining Centuri shares into the market, a distribution of Centuri shares to Company stockholders, through an exchange of Centuri shares for Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. shares, or a combination thereof. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes with regard to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the MD A in the Companies Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. No material changes have occurred related to the disclosures about market risk since December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Management of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and Southwest Gas Corporation has established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in their respective reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of each company, including each respective Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override of the control. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. 
 Based on the most recent evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, management of Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. and Southwest Gas Corporation, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes the Company s and Southwest s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at attaining the level of reasonable assurance noted above. 
 There have been no changes in the Company s or Southwest s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
