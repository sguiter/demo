 Advance Ticket Sales. The Company defers amounts related to future travel in its Advance ticket sales liability account. All tickets sold at any given point in time have travel dates through the subsequent 12 months. The Company estimates the value of Advance ticket sales that will expire unused ("breakage") and recognizes revenue and any changes in estimates in proportion to the usage of the related tickets. To determine breakage, the Company uses its historical experience with expired tickets and certificates and other facts, such as recent aging trends, program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate expiration patterns. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized approximately billion and billion, respectively, of passenger revenue for tickets that were included in Advance ticket sales at the beginning of those periods. 
 Ancillary Fees. The Company charges fees, separately from ticket sales, for certain ancillary services that are directly related to passenger travel. This includes fees for baggage, premium seats, inflight amenities and other ticket-related fees. These ancillary fees are part of the travel performance obligation and, as such, are recognized as passenger revenue when the travel occurs. The Company recorded billion and billion of ancillary fees within passenger revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recorded billion and billion of ancillary fees within passenger revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The portion related to the MileagePlus miles awarded of the total amounts received from our various partner agreements is deferred and presented in the table above as an increase to the Frequent flyer deferred revenue.

 In August 2024, the Company repurchased, through open market repurchases following the exercise of the Warrants described above, shares of UAL common stock, which was recorded as an approximately million increase to Stock held in treasury, at cost. These share repurchases were executed outside a publicly announced plan or program using cash resources. 
 On October 15, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors ("Board") authorized a new share repurchase program, allowing for purchases of up to billion in the aggregate of outstanding UAL common stock and Warrants, subject to a limit of million in the aggregate through 2024. Unless suspended or terminated earlier by the Board, this program has no set expiration date and will therefore terminate when the Company has completed all purchases authorized under the program. The specific timing and number of shares of UAL common stock or Warrants purchased will be determined by the Company's management at its discretion and will vary based on the capital needs of the business, the market price of UAL common stock, general market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors. The purchases may be effected through a combination of one or more open market and privately negotiated transactions (including under trading plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as well as transactions structured through investment banking institutions and other derivative transactions (including through one or more accelerated share repurchase programs).

As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of these investments was million. 
 Notes Receivable. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has million of notes receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, the majority of which is from certain of its regional carriers. The current portions of the notes receivable are recorded in Receivables, less allowance for credit losses. The long-term portion of the notes receivable is recorded in Investments in affiliates and other, less allowance for credit losses on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

737 MAX 8 737 MAX 9 737 MAX 10 A321neo A321XLR A350 (a) United also has options and purchase rights for additional aircraft. (b) Expected aircraft deliveries reflect adjustments to contractual delivery schedules as communicated by Boeing and Airbus, as otherwise agreed between the relevant parties, or as estimated by United. However, aircraft deliveries are subject to a number of variables, as further described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K, and we cannot guarantee delivery of any particular aircraft at any specific time notwithstanding firm purchase commitments. 
 
 The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery through 2033. The amount and timing of the Company's future capital commitments could change to the extent that: (i) the Company and the aircraft manufacturers, with whom the Company has existing orders for new aircraft, agree to modify (or further modify) the contracts governing those orders; (ii) rights are exercised pursuant to the relevant agreements to cancel deliveries or modify the timing of deliveries; or (iii) the aircraft manufacturers are unable to deliver in accordance with the terms of those orders. 
 On April 14, 2024, the Company entered into confidential arrangements with Boeing with respect to compensation for financial damages incurred in the first quarter of 2024 due to the Federal Aviation Administration grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft, and a confidential agreement to accommodate certification delays for the Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft. The compensation provided by Boeing for the grounding damages and in connection with rescheduling deliveries was in the form of credit memos for use on future purchases from Boeing. The Company is accounting for these arrangements as a reduction to the cost basis of the previously-delivered Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and future deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 and Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft, which will reduce future depreciation expense associated with these aircraft. 
 2025 2026 2027 2028 After 2028 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements with major aircraft leasing companies to lease Airbus A321neo aircraft with expected deliveries in 2026 and 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into leases with rental obligations of approximately billion for several mainline aircraft, regional aircraft under CPAs, airport facilities and office space, none of which had commenced as of such date. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2027 with lease terms of up to years. 
 Regional CPAs . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, United amended several of its CPAs with certain of its regional carriers to increase the contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) paid to those carriers, modify the terms for certain aircraft, and modify service entry dates for certain previously grounded aircraft. Our future commitments under our CPAs are dependent on numerous variables, and are, therefore, difficult to predict. The most important of these variables is the number of scheduled block hours. Although we are not required to purchase a minimum number of block hours under certain of our CPAs, we have set forth below estimates of our future payments under the CPAs based on our assumptions. The actual amounts we pay to our regional operators under CPAs could differ materially from these estimates. United's estimates of its future payments under all of the CPAs do not include the portion of the underlying obligation for any aircraft leased to a regional carrier, or

 Guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, United is the guarantor of approximately billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with these obligations are accounted for as operating leases recognized on the Company's consolidated balance sheet with the associated expense recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. All of these bonds are due between 2027 and 2041. 
 As of September 30, 2024, United is the guarantor of million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of United's regional carriers. The aircraft mortgage debt is subject to similar increased cost provisions as described below for the Company's debt, and the Company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees. 
 Increased Cost Provisions. In United's financing transactions that include loans in which United is the borrower, United typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans with respect to which the interest rate is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law, subject, in most cases, to obligations of the lenders to take certain limited steps to mitigate the requirement for, or the amount of, such increased costs. At September 30, 2024, the Company had billion of floating rate debt with remaining terms of up to approximately years that are subject to these increased cost provisions. In several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non-U.S. entities, with remaining terms of up to approximately years and an aggregate balance of billion, the Company bears the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non-U.S. entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions. 
 Labor . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately employees, of whom approximately were represented by various U.S. labor organizations. 
 On February 23, 2024, United's International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ("IAM"), which represents security guards in California and central load planners, ratified new collective bargaining agreements. The ratified agreements are effective through 2025. 
 On February 28, 2024, United and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) reached a tentative agreement for an extension to their labor contract, which covers United's technicians and related employees. On April 17, 2024, the United technicians declined the proposed contract extension and will continue to work under their current agreement, which becomes amendable in December 2024.

billion and the revolving loan commitments of the 2024 Non-Extending Lenders equal million. As of September 30, 2024, we had billion undrawn and available under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Loans, if any, bear interest at a variable rate equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility), generally subject to a floor, plus a credit adjustment spread described in the Revolving Credit Facility, or, at United's election, another rate based on certain market interest rates, also generally subject to a floor, in each case plus a variable margin ranging from to , in the case of Term SOFR loans, and to , in the case of loans at other market rates. 
 On February 22, 2024, the Company also entered into Amendment No. 2 to Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement (as amended, the "Term Loan Facility" and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the "Loan Facilities") and (i) used available cash in an amount equal to billion to partially prepay the term loans under the 2021 term loans and (ii) borrowed the entire term loan commitment available under the Term Loan Facility in an amount equal to billion and used the proceeds of such terms loans (the "Term Loans") to prepay in full the remaining outstanding principal balance under the existing term loan facility. The Term Loans bear interest at a variable rate equal to Term SOFR (subject to a floor of ); or, at United's election, another rate based on certain market interest rates (subject to a floor of ), in each case plus a margin of , in the case of Term SOFR loans, and , in the case of loans at other market rates. The remaining balance of the Term Loans will mature and be due and payable on February 22, 2031. 
 On July 2, 2024, the Company voluntarily prepaid in full the outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility of the MileagePlus Financing, which was billion, in addition to all accrued and unpaid interest and fees under the term loan facility and terminated all commitments thereunder. 
 Equipment Notes. On August 5, 2024, the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as subordination agent and pass through trustee (the "Trustee") under certain pass through trusts newly formed by the Company, entered into the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement"). The Note Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance by the Company of equipment notes (the "Equipment Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of approximately billion secured by Boeing aircraft delivered new from the manufacturer from October 2010 to December 2023 (collectively, the "Aircraft"). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on August 5, 2024, the Trustee purchased Equipment Notes issued under a trust indenture and mortgage (each, an "Indenture" and, collectively, the "Indentures") with respect to each Aircraft entered into by the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as mortgagee. Each Indenture provides for the issuance of Equipment Notes in series: Series AA, bearing interest at the rate of per annum, and Series A, bearing interest at the rate of per annum, in aggregate principal amounts equal to million and million , respectively. The Equipment Notes were purchased by the Trustee, using the proceeds from the sale of Pass Through Certificates, Series 2024-1AA, and Pass Through Certificates, Series 2024-1A, issued by two pass through trusts newly-formed by the Company. The interest on the Equipment Notes is payable semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15, beginning on February 15, 2025. The principal payments on the Equipment Notes are scheduled on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2025 for certain Equipment Notes and August 15, 2025 for the remaining Equipment Notes. The final payments on the Equipment Notes will be due on or prior to February 15, 2037.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 Overview 
 United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "UAL" or the "Company") is a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "United"). 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is a combined report of UAL and United, including their respective consolidated financial statements. As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United's operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100 of UAL's revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL's assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures, and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words "we," "our," "us," and the "Company" in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United. 
 Our shared purpose is "Connecting People. Uniting the World." We have the most comprehensive route network among North American carriers, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations, which utilize jet aircraft with at least 126 seats, and regional operations, which utilize smaller aircraft that are operated under contract by United's regional carriers. The Company serves virtually every major market around the world, either directly or through participation in Star Alliance , the world's largest airline alliance. 
 Our current expectations described below are forward-looking statements and our actual results and timing may vary materially based on various factors that include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under "Economic and Market Factors", "Governmental Actions" and "Forward-Looking Information" and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Form 10-K"). The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. 
 Economic and Market Factors 
 The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. We, like other companies in our industry, have been subject to these and other industry-specific competitive dynamics. In addition, our operations, supply chain, partners and suppliers have been subject to various global macroeconomic factors. We expect to continue to remain vulnerable to a number of industry-specific and global macroeconomic factors that may cause our actual results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations or current expectations. The economic and market factors and trends that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the execution risks associated with our United Next plan, especially relating to the growth in the scale of our operations as a result of the plan; the impact on the Company of significant operational challenges by third parties on which we rely; rising inflationary pressures; labor market and supply chain constraints and related costs affecting us and our partners; volatile fuel prices; aircraft delivery delays; increasing maintenance expenses; changes in interest rates; and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, including an economic downturn leading to a decrease in demand for air travel or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may impact international travel demand. We continue to monitor the potential favorable or unfavorable impacts of these and other factors on our business, operations, financial condition, future results of operations, liquidity and financial flexibility, which are dependent on future developments, including as a result of those factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of the 2023 Form 10-K. Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility and our growth plans may be delayed, particularly in the short term, due to the impact of the above factors and trends. 
 Governmental Actions 
 We operate in complex, highly regulated environments in the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom and other regions around the world. Compliance with laws, regulations, administrative practices and other restrictions or legal requirements in the countries in which we do business is onerous and expensive. In addition, changes to existing legal requirements or the 
 25 

Table of Contents 

implementation of new legal requirements and any failure to comply with such legal requirements could negatively impact our business, operations, financial condition, future results of operations, liquidity and financial flexibility by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company's products and services and requiring changes to the Company's supply chain and its business. Legal requirements that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the closure of our flying airspace and termination of other operations due to regional conflicts, including the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our flying as a result of the military conflict in the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of these conflicts beyond their current scope; delays in aircraft certification (especially relating to the 737 MAX 10 aircraft); increased Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") oversight of the aircraft production process; and any legal requirement that would result in a reshaping of the benefits that we provide to our consumers through our loyalty program or the co-branded credit cards issued by our partner. Changes in existing applicable legal requirements or new applicable legal requirements as well as the related interpretations and enforcement practices regarding them, create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be understood and applied. As a result, the impact of changing and new legal requirements generally cannot be reasonably predicted and those requirements may ultimately require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 The Company recorded net income of 1.0 billion for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to net income of 1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2023.

 Passenger revenue increased 212 million, or 1.6 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to a 4.1 increase in capacity, partially offset by lower yields in all geographic regions except Atlantic. 
 Cargo revenue increased 84 million, or 25.2 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher tonnage. 
 27 

Table of Contents 

Other operating revenue increased 63 million, or 7.9 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in mileage revenue from non-airline partners, including credit card spending with our co-branded credit card partner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as well as increases in the purchases of United Club memberships, visitor volume and purchases of one-time United Club passes. 
 Operating Expenses. The table below includes data related to the Company's operating expenses for the three months ended September 30 (in millions, except for percentage changes): 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change (a) Salaries and related costs 4,323 3,914 409 10.4 Aircraft fuel 2,993 3,342 (349) (10.4) Landing fees and other rent 866 801 65 8.1 Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 765 684 81 11.8 Depreciation and amortization 742 663 79 11.9 Regional capacity purchase 651 592 59 10.0 Distribution expenses 574 516 58 11.2 Aircraft rent 65 46 19 41.3 Special charges (5) 29 (34) NM Other 2,304 2,158 146 6.8 Total operating expenses 13,278 12,745 533 4.2 (a) NM - Greater than 100 change or otherwise not meaningful. 
 Salaries and related costs increased 409 million, or 10.4 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to annual wage rate increases across certain employee groups and a 4.4 increase in headcount largely due to increased flight activity. 
 Aircraft fuel expense decreased by 349 million, or 10.4 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, due to a lower average price per gallon of fuel, partially offset by increased consumption from higher flight activity. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon in the three months ended September 30 (in millions, except percentage change and per gallon data): 
 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Fuel expense 2,993 3,342 (349) (10.4) Fuel consumption (gallons) 1,170 1,132 38 3.4 Average price per gallon 2.56 2.95 (0.39) (13.2) 
 Landing fees and other rent increased 65 million, or 8.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to rate increases at various airports, terminal expansions and other increases in the number of airport gates and higher landed weight volume due to increased flight activity. 
 Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 81 million, or 11.8 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to increased volumes of engine overhauls and component repair costs. 
 Depreciation expense increased 79 million, or 11.9 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to the induction of new aircraft and related spare parts, as well as certain aircraft improvements. 
 Regional capacity purchase expense increased 59 million, or 10.0 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in regional capacity. 
 Distribution expenses increased 58 million, or 11.2 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to 68 million of commissions that were recorded as contra-revenue in 2023.

 See Note 9 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on the Company's special charges. 
 Other operating expenses increased 146 million, or 6.8 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year ago period, primarily due to increased flight activity and onboard passengers as well as the impacts of inflationary pressures. Other operating expenses include expenditures related to information technology projects and services, food and beverage offerings, passenger services, personnel-related costs and ground handling. 
 Nonoperating Income (Expense ). The table below shows year-over-year comparisons of the Company's nonoperating income (expense) for the three months ended September 30 (in millions, except for percentage changes): 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Interest expense (379) (493) (114) (23.1) Interest income 187 234 (47) (20.1) Interest capitalized 53 48 5 10.4 Unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net (90) (54) 36 NM Miscellaneous, net (50) 11 (61) NM Total nonoperating income (expense) (279) (254) 25 9.8 
 Interest expense decreased 114 million, or 23.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of various debt prepayments and scheduled amortization combined with lower interest rates on refinanced debt. 
 Interest income decreased 47 million, or 20.1 , in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower balances in our short-term investment portfolio, which was partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 Unrealized losses on investments, net, was 90 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 54 million in the year-ago period, primarily due to the change in the market value of the Company's investments in equity securities.

 Salaries and related costs increased 1.4 billion, or 12.9 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to annual wage rate increases across certain employee groups and a 4.4 increase in headcount largely due to increased flight activity. 
 Aircraft fuel expense decreased 256 million, or 2.7 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to a lower average price per gallon of fuel, partially offset by increased consumption from higher flight activity. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon in the nine months ended September 30 (in millions, except percentage change and per gallon data): 
 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Fuel expense 9,080 9,336 (256) (2.7) Fuel consumption (gallons) 3,329 3,146 183 5.8 Average price per gallon 2.73 2.97 (0.24) (8.1) 
 Landing fees and other rent increased 253 million, or 11.1 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to rate increases at various airports, terminal expansions and other increases in the number of airport gates and higher landed weight volume due to increased flight activity. 
 Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 182 million, or 8.8 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to increased flight activity and increased volumes of engine overhauls, materials use and component repair costs. 
 Depreciation expense increased 182 million, or 9.2 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to the induction of new aircraft and related spare parts, as well as certain aircraft improvements. 
 Distribution expenses increased 274 million, or 19.5 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to higher credit card fees, travel agency commissions and global distribution fees driven by the overall increase in passenger revenue and 187 million of commissions that were recorded as contra-revenue in 2023. 
 Details of the Company's special charges include the following for the nine months ended September 30 (in millions): 
 2024 2023 (Gains) losses on sale of assets and other special charges 44 88 Labor contract ratification bonuses 814 Special charges 44 902

Other operating expenses increased 674 million, or 11.3 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to increased flight activity and onboard passengers, as well as the impacts of inflationary pressures. Other operating expenses include expenditures related to information technology projects and services, food and beverage offerings, passenger services, personnel-related costs and ground handling. 
 Nonoperating Income (Expense). The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the Company's nonoperating income (expense) for the nine months ended September 30 (in millions, except for percentage changes): 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Change Interest expense (1,260) (1,472) (212) (14.4) Interest income 554 620 (66) (10.6) Interest capitalized 174 128 46 35.9 Unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net (160) 54 (214) NM Miscellaneous, net (40) 73 (113) NM Total nonoperating income (expense) (732) (597) 135 22.6 
 Interest expense decreased 212 million, or 14.4 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of various debt prepayments and scheduled amortization combined with lower interest rates on refinanced debt. 
 Interest income decreased 66 million, or 10.6 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower balances in our short-term investment portfolio, which were partially offset by higher interest rates. 
 Interest capitalized increased 46 million, or 35.9 , in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to an increase in accumulated spend on capital projects and an increase in aircraft purchase deposit balances. 
 Unrealized losses on investments, net, was 160 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 54 million in unrealized gains in the year-ago period, primarily due to the change in the market value of the Company's investments in equity securities. See Note 6 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to these equity investments. 
 Miscellaneous, net changed by 113 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to debt extinguishment and modification fees related to the prepayment of the outstanding principal balance of its MileagePlus term loan and the refinancing of the Company's 2021 term loans, higher foreign exchange losses and a decrease in the benefit from the Company's net periodic benefit cost of its pension and postretirement benefit plans. 
 Income Taxes. See Note 4 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for information related to income taxes. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Current Liquidity 
 We deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, including returns to shareholders through potential share repurchases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 14.2 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to 14.4 billion at December 31, 2023. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated liquidity needs for the next twelve months, and we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with our anticipated access to the capital markets and projected cash from operations. We regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements (including in connection with our capital commitments for our firm order aircraft and any changes to such commitments), planned UAL common stock or Warrant purchases under our share repurchase program and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. We also regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital structure to efficiently manage financial risks, liquidity access and cost of capital. 
 On April 16, 2024, the Company increased its revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") loan commitments by 100 million for a total amount of 2.965 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which 2.8 billion expires February 15, 2029 and 165 million expires April 21, 2025. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by certain route authorities and airport slots and gates. No borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, leases of aircraft, airport and other facilities, and pension funding obligations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 33.4 billion of debt, finance lease, operating lease and other financial liabilities, including 3.9 billion that will become due in the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of certain new aircraft and related spare engines. Our debt agreements contain customary terms and conditions as well as various affirmative, negative and financial covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends or repurchase stock. As of September 30, 2024, UAL and United were in compliance with their respective debt covenants. As of September 30, 2024, a substantial portion of the Company's assets, principally aircraft and certain related assets, its loyalty program, certain route authorities and airport slots and gates, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on aircraft financing and other debt instruments. 
 The Company has backstop financing commitments available from certain of its aircraft manufacturers for a limited number of its future aircraft deliveries, subject to certain customary conditions. See Note 7 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, United had firm commitments to purchase aircraft from The Boeing Company ("Boeing") and Airbus S.A.S. ("Airbus") as presented in the table below: 
 Contractual Aircraft Deliveries Expected Aircraft Deliveries (b) Aircraft Type Number of Firm Commitments (a) Last Three Months of 2024 2025 After 2025 Last Three Months of 2024 2025 After 2025 787 150 8 18 124 3 11 136 737 MAX 8 18 18 2 16 737 MAX 9 141 31 40 70 3 28 110 737 MAX 10 167 167 167 A321neo 115 14 23 78 14 23 78 A321XLR 50 50 50 A350 45 45 45 (a) United also has options and purchase rights for additional aircraft. (b) Expected aircraft deliveries reflect adjustments to contractual delivery schedules as communicated by Boeing and Airbus, as otherwise agreed between the relevant parties, or as estimated by United. However, aircraft deliveries are subject to a number of variables, as further described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K, and we cannot guarantee delivery of any particular aircraft at any specific time notwithstanding firm purchase commitments. 
 
 The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery through 2033. The amount and timing of the Company's future capital commitments could change to the extent that: (i) the Company and the aircraft manufacturers, with whom the Company has existing orders for new aircraft, agree to modify (or further modify) the contracts governing those orders; (ii) rights are exercised pursuant to the relevant agreements to cancel deliveries or modify the timing of deliveries; or (iii) the aircraft manufacturers are unable to deliver in accordance with the terms of those orders. 
 On April 14, 2024, the Company entered into confidential arrangements with Boeing with respect to compensation for financial damages incurred in the first quarter of 2024 due to the FAA grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft, and a confidential agreement to accommodate certification delays for the Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft. The compensation provided by Boeing for the grounding damages and in connection with rescheduling deliveries was in the form of credit memos for use on future purchases from Boeing. The Company is accounting for these arrangements as a reduction to the cost basis of the previously-delivered Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft and future deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 and Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft, which will reduce future depreciation expense associated with these aircraft. 
 The table below summarizes United's firm commitments as of September 30, 2024, which include aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and non-aircraft capital commitments. Aircraft commitments are based on contractual scheduled aircraft deliveries.

 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements with major aircraft leasing companies to lease 40 Airbus A321neo aircraft with expected deliveries in 2026 and 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into leases with rental obligations of approximately 4.0 billion for several mainline aircraft, regional aircraft under CPAs, airport facilities and office space, none of which had commenced as of such date. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2027 with lease terms of up to 12 years. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 As part of our capital deployment program, the Company announced on October 15, 2024 that its Board of Directors ("Board") authorized a new share repurchase program, allowing for purchases of up to 1.5 billion in the aggregate of outstanding UAL common stock and Warrants, subject to a limit of 500 million in the aggregate through 2024. Unless suspended or terminated earlier by the Board, this program has no set expiration date and will therefore terminate when the Company has completed all purchases authorized under the program, which it expects to complete by the end of 2025. 
 See Note 2 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30 (in millions):

 Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 0.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to changes in various working capital items, including higher payments for employee wages and incentives in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased 4.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to a decrease in the purchase of short-term and other investments. 
 Financing Activities. Significant financing events in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Debt, Finance Lease and Other Financing Liability Principal Payments . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made payments for debt, finance leases, and other financing liabilities of 8.8 billion, including the 3.9 billion prepayment of its 2021 term loan and the 1.8 billion prepayment of the outstanding principal balance of its MileagePlus term loan.

Table of Contents 

Debt and Other Financing Liabilities Issuances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised: 
 2.5 billion under the new term loan facility; 
 1.4 billion in equipment notes: On August 5, 2024, the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as subordination agent and pass through trustee (the "Trustee") under certain pass through trusts newly formed by the Company, entered into the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement"). The Note Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance by the Company of equipment notes (the "Equipment Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 1.4 billion secured by 48 Boeing aircraft delivered new from the manufacturer from October 2010 to December 2023 (collectively, the "Aircraft"). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on August 5, 2024, the Trustee purchased Equipment Notes issued under a trust indenture and mortgage (each, an "Indenture" and, collectively, the "Indentures") with respect to each Aircraft entered into by the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as mortgagee. Each Indenture provides for the issuance of Equipment Notes in two series: Series AA, bearing interest at the rate of 5.450 per annum, and Series A, bearing interest at the rate of 5.875 per annum, in aggregate principal amounts equal to 969 million and 385 million , respectively. The Equipment Notes were purchased by the Trustee, using the proceeds from the sale of Pass Through Certificates, Series 2024-1AA, and Pass Through Certificates, Series 2024-1A, issued by two pass through trusts newly-formed by the Company. The interest on the Equipment Notes is payable semi-annually on each February 15 and August 15, beginning on February 15, 2025. The principal payments on the Equipment Notes are scheduled on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2025 for certain Equipment Notes and August 15, 2025 for the remaining Equipment Notes. The final payments on the Equipment Notes will be due on or prior to February 15, 2037 ; and 
 1.5 billion through the issuance of debt, not including the equipment notes, and other financial liabilities on aircraft. 
 See Note 8 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on these financing activities. 
 Credit Ratings. As of the filing date of this report, UAL and United had the following corporate credit ratings: 
 S P Moody's Fitch UAL BB- Ba2 BB- United BB- BB- The credit agency does not issue corporate credit ratings for subsidiary entities. 
 
 These credit ratings are below investment grade levels; however, the Company has been able to secure financing with investment grade credit ratings for certain enhanced equipment trust certificates, term loans and secured bond financings. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability, or increase the cost, of future financing for the Company as well as affect the fair market value of existing debt. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. 
 Commitments, Contingencies and Liquidity Matters. As described in the 2023 Form 10-K, the Company's liquidity may be adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, pension funding obligations, reserve requirements associated with credit card processing agreements, guarantees, commitments and contingencies. 
 See the 2023 Form 10-K and Notes 6, 7 and 8 to the financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulation. 
 Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without limitation, the following: execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our fleet and network strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or entry into aircraft orders on less favorable terms, as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned, including as a result of any mandatory groundings of aircraft; any failure to effectively manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other portfolio actions, or related exposures to unknown liabilities or other issues or underperformance as compared to our expectations; adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft, engines and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States and globally; reliance on third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or other airports; geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security events (including the suspension of our overflying in Russian airspace as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and interruptions of our flying as a result of the military conflict in the Middle East, as well as any escalation of the broader economic consequences of these conflicts beyond their current scope); any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the impact of any significant failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, these technologies or systems; increasing privacy, data security and cybersecurity obligations or a significant data breach; increased use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions or regulatory compliance costs on our operations or financial performance; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or agreement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change, and any failure to achieve or demonstrate progress towards our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel; the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt, including our MileagePlus financing agreements; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the impacts of seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage; risks relating to our repurchase program for UAL common stock and Warrants; and other risks and uncertainties set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of the 2023 Form 10-K, and under "Economic and Market Factors" and "Governmental Actions" in Part I, Item 2.

The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections, beliefs and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change. For instance, we regularly monitor future demand and booking trends and adjust capacity, as needed. As such, our actual flown capacity may differ materially from currently published flight schedules or current estimations.

The management of UAL and United, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to conclude with reasonable assurance that UAL's and United's disclosure controls and procedures were designed and operating effectively to report the information each company is required to disclose in the reports it files with the SEC on a timely basis. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of UAL and United have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting during the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in UAL's or United's internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, their internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of the 2023 Form 10-K for a description of legal proceedings. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K except for the following risk factor related to the Company's share repurchase program. 
 We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value. 
 As part of our capital deployment program, the Board has authorized a share repurchase program. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that the share repurchase program will be fully consummated. However, the program does not obligate us to purchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of UAL common stock or Warrants. The specific timing and amount of any share or Warrant purchases will depend on the capital needs of the business, the market price of UAL common stock, general market conditions, securities law limitations and other factors. Our future repurchases of UAL common stock and Warrants, if any, may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice, which could adversely affect our stock price. We, therefore, cannot guarantee that the share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value.

See Note 2 to the financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on the share repurchase program. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 (a) A putative stockholder class action complaint, styled as Colleen Witmer v. J. Scott Kirby, et al., C.A. No. 2024-0375-PAF was filed on April 10, 2024 in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Action"). The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the board of directors of the Company (the "Board") breached its fiduciary duties by adopting Amendment No. 2 to the Company s Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the "Plan"). The Company believes that the plaintiff s claims were not meritorious when filed because the Plan was a reasonable response to the threat that the Company s net operating loss carryforwards could be permanently limited or lost under Section 1.382-3(a)(1) of the Treasury Regulations. On May 8, 2024, the parties stipulated to dismissal, which the court so ordered, based on their agreement that the Board would approve and disclose an amendment to the Plan. On April 23, 2024, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing Amendment No. 3 to the Plan, which revised the definitions of "Beneficial Owner," "Beneficially Own" and "Beneficial Ownership" under the Plan (and made other conforming changes). The Company disputes that these changes caused any benefit to the Company or its stockholders. On May 8, 2024, the court dismissed the action as moot and retained jurisdiction solely for the purpose of deciding any application by the plaintiff's counsel for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses. To avoid the cost, burden, and uncertainty inherent in litigation, the Company has agreed to pay 600,000 in fees and expenses to the plaintiff's counsel. On October 14, 2024, the court entered a stipulation and order providing that the Action will be dismissed with prejudice and the case will be closed, subject to the Company filing an affidavit with the court confirming that this notice has been disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In entering the order, the court was not asked to review, and did not pass judgment on, the amount or reasonableness of the attorneys' fees and expenses. The plaintiff's counsel is Christoper J. Orrico of Bernstein Litowitz Berger Grossmann LLP, (212) 544-1400, and the Company's counsel is Rudolf Koch of Richards, Layton Finger, P.A., (302) 651-7700. 
 (b) None. 
 (c) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or "officer" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company or United informed the Company or United of the , modification or of a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or a "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.
