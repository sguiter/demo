on these sources of capital in the future until it is able to generate revenues.

assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, such financing may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income
taxes. There were unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024

Enviro
Therapeutics 

On
June 2, 2021, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Enviro Therapeutics, Inc. (Enviro), entered into two Exclusive License Agreements
with Cedars, which granted Enviro exclusive licensing rights (which include the right to sublicense) with respect to certain patent rights
owned by Cedars, as follows: 

an
 Exclusive License Agreement (the Enviro-Cedars License Agreement (Mitochondrial DNA) for Enviro to develop, manufacture,
 use and sell products utilized or derived from patent rights worldwide related to the Compositions and Methods for Treating
 Diseases and Conditions by Depletion of Mitochondrial DNA from Circulation and for Detection of Mitochondrial DNA invented
 by Dr. Neil Bhowmick and others; and 

an
 Exclusive License Agreement, (the Enviro-Cedars License Agreement (Endoglin Antagonism) and, collectively with the

 use and sell products utilized or derived from the patent rights and technical information worldwide related to the Sensitization
 of Tumors to Therapies Through Endoglin Antagonism invented by Dr. Neil Bhowmick and others. 

In
exchange for each of the licenses, Enviro is required to pay an upfront license fee in the mid four-figures and low-five figures, respectively.
Enviro is also required to reimburse Cedars for the costs in the mid-to-high six figures incurred in the prosecution of the patent rights

licensed patent right and less than one percent of net sales of other products derived from Cedars technical information, with
a minimum annual royalty fee in the low five-digits due beginning on the third anniversary of the effective date of the Enviro-Cedars
License Agreements. To the extent Enviro derives non-royalty sublicensing revenues, a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage
of such revenues would be due and payable to Cedars, with the actual percentage of such revenues dependent on the stage of FDA authorization
at the time the sublicense revenue is generated. 

Enviro
is also required to pay Cedars in connection with achieving the following Payment Milestones relating to products derived from the patent
rights: successful completion of a Phase I clinical trial; successful completion of a Phase II clinical trial, receipt of FDA approval,
and approval for a Phase III clinical trial; FDA approval of an NDA or BLA; cumulative net sales exceeding ; and cumulative net
sales exceeding . If all of these payment milestones are met among both of the Enviro-Cedars License Agreements, the required

License Agreement (Endoglin Antagonism), Enviro is obligated to . 

The
Enviro-Cedars License Agreements will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country-by-country basis until the last of the
patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights expires. Under the terms of the Enviro-Cedars License Agreements, unless waived
by Cedars, the agreements would automatically terminate: (a) if Enviro ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (b) if
performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of Cedars or the agreement is deemed illegal
by a governmental body; (c) within 30 days for non-payment of royalties or if Enviro fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts
to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (d) within 60 days of Cedars failure to cure any breach or default of a

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations. 

(in
thousands, except for share amounts and per share data) 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited consolidated
financial statements and related notes appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report ), and with our audited financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our prospectus dated September 16, 2024 (File Number: 333-274805)(the
 Prospectus ). 

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

In
addition to historical information, some of the statements contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, constitute forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations
and any projections about future events. The following information and any forward-looking statements should be considered in light
of factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, along with the risks identified in the Prospectus under the title
 Risk Factors and in our other filings with the Securities Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 

We
caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report. Statements made herein are as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report with the SEC and
should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development
of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, they may not
be predictive of results or developments in future periods. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the
rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions
or circumstances on which any such statements may be based or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those
set forth in the forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing therapeutics for cancer patients that are designed to overcome key hurdles in
immune suppression and drug resistance. 

Our
mission is to advance our portfolio of innovative therapeutics to reverse key mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and immune suppression
and transform the way cancer is treated. We have leveraged molecular insights of the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and immune
suppression to develop a new class of novel drugs that we expect will target drug resistance and checkpoints of immune suppression. As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, our product candidates have not been approved as
safe or effective by the Food and Drug Administration FDA or any other comparable foreign regulator. 

Since
inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing
our technology, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical
and clinical studies and manufacturing. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product
sales. 

Since
inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were 1,623 and 1,812 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 7,835. We expect
to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we advance our current and
future product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture drug product and drug supply, seek regulatory approval
for our current and future product candidates, maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio, hire additional research and
development and business personnel and operate as a public company. 

19 

We
will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval
for our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and do not enter into a third-party
commercialization partnership, we will likely incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support
product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution activities. 

As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can
generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private
equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing
arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on acceptable
terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when needed, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The
report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023
included an explanatory paragraph indicating that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note
1 to our annual financial statements appearing at the Prospectus for additional information on our assessment. 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of 3,217. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on
the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and raising additional capital to meet its obligations and
repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Since inception, the Company has funded its operations
primarily through equity and debt financings and it expects to continue to rely on these sources of capital in the future. 

No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the
reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results may differ materially from our estimates and
judgments under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts
and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in our financial statements prospectively from the date
of the change in estimate. 

We
define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about
matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as
the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2
to our unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quartey
Report, we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require
significant estimates and judgments. 

20 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates. We expense
research and development costs as incurred. 

At
the end of each reporting period, we compare payments made to third-party service providers to the estimated progress toward completion
of the applicable research or development objectives. Such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
Depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the progress that we estimate has been made as a result of the service
provided, we may record net prepaid or accrued expenses relating to these costs. As of December 31, 2023, and September 30,
2024, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company measures all stock
options and other stock-based awards granted based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation
expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The Company
has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur. The reversal of compensation cost previously recognized for an award that is forfeited
because of a failure to satisfy a service or performance condition is recognized in the period of the forfeiture. Generally, the Company
issues stock options with only service-based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards using the straight-line method
over the requisite service period. 

The Company classifies stock-based
compensation expense in its statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient s payroll costs are classified
or in which the award recipients service payments are classified. 

The Company was a private company
until the completion of its IPO on September 17, 2024. The Company estimates the fair value of common stock using an appropriate valuation
methodology, in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid,
Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Each valuation methodology includes estimates and assumptions
that require the Company s judgment. These estimates and assumptions include a number of objective and subjective factors, including
external market conditions, guideline public company information, the prices at which the Company sold its common stock to third parties
in arms length transactions, the rights and preferences of securities senior to the Company s common stock at the time, and
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or sale. Significant changes to the assumptions used
in the valuations could result in different fair values of stock options or warrants at each valuation date, as applicable. 

The fair value of each stock option or warrant grant is estimated using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company was a private company and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility
information. Therefore, it estimated its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of a publicly traded set of peer
companies within the biotechnology industry with characteristics similar to the Company. The expected term of the Company s stock
options has been determined utilizing the simplified method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options.
The expected term of stock options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest
rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately
equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero, based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends
and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have, and we do not currently have,
any off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined under SEC rules). 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

For
a description of recently issued accounting standards that may have a material impact on our financial statements or will otherwise apply
to our operations, please see Note 2 to our unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quartey
Report. 

Emerging Growth
Company Status 

As an emerging growth company, the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act of 2012 permits us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards
applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt
out of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards when they are required to be adopted
by public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 

Components
of Results of Operations 

Net
Sales 

We
have not generated any sales to date. There was no revenue recorded from any sources during the year ended December 31, 2023,
and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating
Expenses 

Our
operating expenses consist of (i) research and development expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Dr.
Ramachandran Murali is our Vice President of Research and Development. Dr. Murali is a doctor and scientist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
and is the inventor, with others, of three of the patent technologies that are subject to the Kairos-Cedars license agreements. 

21 

We are engaged in rolling out Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for ENV-105
and a Phase 1 trial for KROS-201. In addition,
we are continuously performing preclinical research including animal models of disease, medicinal chemistry laboratory studies, formulation,
and toxicology and biodistribution studies. Our clinical development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as: per patient
trial costs; the number of trials required for approval; the number of sites included in the trials; the location where the trials are
conducted; the length of time required to enroll eligible patients; the number of patients that participate in the trials; the number
of doses that patients receive; the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; potential additional safety monitoring requested by
regulatory agencies; the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up; the cost and timing of manufacturing our product
candidates; the phase of development of our product candidates; and the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. 

The
successful development and commercialization of product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with product development and commercialization, including the following: the timing and progress of nonclinical and clinical
development activities; the number and scope of nonclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; raising necessary additional funds;
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we may enter into collaboration arrangements; our ability to maintain our
current development program and to establish new ones; our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements; the successful
initiation and completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any
comparable foreign regulatory authority; the receipt and related terms of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;
the availability of drug substance and drug product for use in production of our product candidate; establishing and maintaining agreements
with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are
approved; our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and
internationally; our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; the commercialization of our product candidates,
if and when approved; obtaining and maintaining third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement; the acceptance of our product
candidate, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; competition with other products; the impact of any
business interruptions to our operations, including the timing and enrollment of patients in our planned clinical trials, or to those
of our manufacturers, suppliers, or other vendors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public health crisis; and a continued
acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could significantly change
the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval
for any of our product candidates. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, corporate and business
development, as well as administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent, corporate, IPO-related matters, and reporting matters; professional fees
for accounting, auditing, tax and administrative consulting services; insurance costs; administrative travel expenses; marketing expenses
and other operating costs. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our business
operations. We also anticipate that we will incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer
insurance costs, as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company.

Expenses 

Other
expenses were 726 and 69 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in 2024 was due to financing
costs recorded during 2024 of 537 and the increase in debt discount amortization in 2024. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of 1,812 and had a shareholders deficit of 2,078 as of December
31, 2023. As reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
incurred a net loss of 1,623 and used cash in operations of 2,152. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company closed its initial public offering IPO and received 5,524 of net
proceeds from this offering, before deducting deferred offering costs. Due to the funds received through this offering, and the conversion
of convertible notes payable and certain accounts payable upon the closing of the IPO, the Company had shareholders equity of
 3,332 at September 30, 2024. The Company now expects its cash, totaling 3,217 at September 30, 2024, to last into the fourth quarter
of 2025. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and
raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.
Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings and it expects to continue to rely
on these sources of capital in the future. 

No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

Operating
Activities 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we provided cash from operating activities of 15, compared to 2,152 used during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 1,623 and had non-cash
expenses of 845, compared to a net loss of 694 and non-cash expenses of 150 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
primary non-cash expense incurred during both periods was amortization expense, totaling 120 during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net change in assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 provided
cash of 559, compared to 1,374 used during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary source of cash relating to the
change in assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was the increase in accounts payable and
accrued expenses. The primary use of cash was the increase in vendor advances. 

Investing
Activities 

There
was no cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 5,276 and (353),
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in financing activities consisted of payments of
deferred offering costs of 390 and 353, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing
activities consisted of 5,524 of proceeds from common stock issued in connection with the IPO and 142 from notes payable 
officers. 

Debt
Agreements 

Advances
from Related Parties 

During
the year ended December 31, 2021, shareholders of the Company, and a company whose principal stockholder is also a stockholder of the
Company, advanced the Company 14, all of which was outstanding at December 31, 2021. The advances accrue no interest, are
unsecured and are due on demand. As of December 31, 2021, 14 was owed on the advances. During the year ended December 31,
2022, the Company repaid 10 of the advances, and as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, and September 30, 2024, a total of 4 remained outstanding. 

Convertible
Notes Payable 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into several convertible note payable agreements with certain investors. The convertible notes accrue interest at 6 per annum, are unsecured and are due by April 2025. If the
Company does not close an IPO transaction within 12 months following the date of issuance of the notes, the Company will have the choice
of paying off the principal plus all accrued and unpaid interest, or the note s principal balance will increase to 110 of its
original balance. The notes are convertible at the option of the noteholders into shares of the Company s common stock at a price
per share as defined in the agreement or will automatically be converted into shares of the Company s common stock at 60 of the
IPO price per share upon the closing of the IPO. The convertible note offerings were completed pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 506(b)
of the Securities Act. Boustead Securities, LLC acted as placement agent in each of the June and September 2022 private placements and
received five-year warrants to purchase shares of common stock equal
to 7.0 of the number of the conversion shares at an exercise price equal to the conversion price. 

26 

As of September 30, 2024, 792 of
principal was outstanding on the notes and 92 of accrued and unpaid interest, which automatically converted into 368,371 shares of the Company s
common stock upon the closing of the Company s IPO. 

Notes
Payable - Officers 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company borrowed 142 from three of its officers. The loans accrue interest at
7.5 per annum, are unsecured and are due one year from the issuance date, with the due dates ranging from April 2025 to August 2025. 

Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the loans were repaid and the officers
were granted 36,269 shares of the Company s common stock. 

Conversion
of Accounts Payable 

Subsequent
to December 31, 2023, we entered into agreements with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Cedars under which Cedars agreed
to convert 750 of the 988 total accounts payable due to them into 312,500 shares of our common stock, with such conversion to
occur upon the closing of the Company s IPO. The conversion price of the shares will be equal to 60 of the per share IPO
price. Upon the closing of the Company s IPO, the 312,500 shares were issued to Cedars and the 750 of debt was forgiven. 

Conversion
of Amounts Due to Related Parties 

Subsequent
to December 31, 2023, two officers and shareholders agreed to convert the 4 due to them into 1,664 shares of the Company s
common stock, effective upon the closing of the Company s IPO. The conversion price of the shares was equal to 60 of the per
share IPO purchase price. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the debt converted, and the 1,664 shares were
issued. 

As
of September 30, 2024, an officer converted 172 of accounts payable owed primarily for past services into 51,610
shares of the Company s common stock, effective upon the closing of the Company s IPO. The conversion price of the shares
was equal to the IPO per share purchase price times a multiple of 1.2, as per the officer s employment agreement. 

Funding
Requirements 

We
expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing research activities, particularly as we pursue the advancement
of our product candidates through clinical trials. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public
company. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend on numerous variables, including: the initiation, progress,
timing, costs and results of the clinical trials for our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop; the initiation,
progress, timing, costs and results of nonclinical studies for our product candidates or any future product candidates we may develop;
our ability to maintain our relationships with key collaborators; the outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals
from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for such authorities to require that we perform more
nonclinical studies or clinical trials than those that we currently expect or change their requirements on studies that had previously
been agreed to; the cost to establish, maintain, expand, enforce and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including
the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing,
prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patents or other intellectual property rights; the effect of competing technological and market
developments; the costs of continuing to grow our business, including hiring key personnel and maintain or acquiring operating space;
market acceptance of any approved product candidates, including product pricing, as well as product coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement
by third-party payors; the cost of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;
the cost and timing of selecting, auditing and potentially validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing; the cost
of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval
and that we determine to commercialize; and our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial
and reporting systems. 

27 

We
believe that our existing cash, plus the net proceeds from the IPO, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust
our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require additional funding to complete the clinical development
and commercialize our product candidates, if we receive regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product
candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related
to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize ourselves. 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity
and debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To
the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interest may be materially
diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current common stockholder. Debt financing and
preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified
actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations,
strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights
to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable
to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required
to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product
candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks. 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not
required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company s management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a
reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure
controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The
design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 INDEMNIFICATION 

Section
5.01 Indemnification by the Company. In consideration of the Investor s execution and delivery of this Agreement, and in addition
to all of the Company s other obligations under this Agreement, the Company shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless
the Investor, its investment manager, and each of their respective officers, directors, managers, members, partners, employees and agents
(including, without limitation, those retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and each person who
controls the Investor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the Investor
Indemnitees from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities
and damages, and reasonable and documented expenses in connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Investor Indemnitee is
a party to the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements
(the Indemnified Liabilities ), incurred by the Investor Indemnitees or any of them as a result of, or arising out
of, or relating to (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for
the registration of the Shares as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any related prospectus, or in any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided , however , that the Company will
not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor specifically for inclusion therein; (b) any material misrepresentation or breach
of any material representation or material warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or any other certificate, instrument or document
contemplated hereby or thereby; or (c) any material breach of any material covenant, material agreement or material obligation of the
Company contained in this Agreement or any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby. To the extent that
the foregoing undertaking by the Company may be unenforceable under Applicable Law, the Company shall make the maximum contribution to
the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities, which is permissible under Applicable Law. 

Section
5.02 Notice of Claim. Promptly after receipt by an Investor Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding
(including any governmental action or proceeding) involving an Indemnified Liability, such Investor Indemnitee, shall, if a claim for
an Indemnified Liability in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Article V, deliver to the indemnifying
party a written notice of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it of liability
under this Article V except to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure. The indemnifying party shall have the
right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed,
to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Investor Indemnitee;
provided, however, that an Investor Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the actual and reasonable third party
fees and expenses of not more than one counsel for such Investor Indemnitee to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Investor Indemnitee and the indemnifying
party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Investor Indemnitee and any other party represented
by such counsel in such proceeding. The Investor Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in connection with any
negotiation or defense of any such action or claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information
reasonably available to the Investor Indemnitee which relates to such action or claim. The indemnifying party shall keep the Investor
Indemnitee reasonably apprised as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. No indemnifying party
shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however,
that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. No indemnifying party shall, without the
prior written consent of the Investor Indemnitee, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Investor Indemnitee of a release from
all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall
be subrogated to all rights of the Investor Indemnitee with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter
for which indemnification has been made. The indemnification required by this Article V shall be made by periodic payments of the amount
thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received and payment therefor is due, subject to receipt
by the indemnifying party of an undertaking to repay any amounts that such party is ultimately not entitled to receive as indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement. 

Section
5.03 Remedies. The remedies provided for in this Article V are not exclusive and shall not limit any right or remedy which may be
available to any indemnified person at law or equity. The obligations of the parties to indemnify or make contribution under this Article
V shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.

 Company may file one or more additional Registration Statements for the resale by Investor of Registrable Securities at anytime thereafter,
 if necessary. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have the ability to request any Advances until the effectiveness
 of a Registration Statement registering the applicable Registrable Securities for resale by the Investor. The Company and the Investor
 shall mutually agree on a good faith estimate of the number of Commitment Fee Shares which may be issuable pursuant to Section 13.04

 excess shares as Common Stock issuable and saleable to the Investor pursuant to Advances hereunder. 

b. 
 Maintaining
 a Registration Statement . After the Filing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
 of the Resale Registration Statement, as well as any Registration Statement, that has been declared effective at all times during

 has completed resales pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement or any Registration Statement for the full Commitment Amount,
 then the Company shall be under no further obligation to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement. Notwithstanding
 anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, when
 filed, each Registration Statement (including, without limitation, all amendments and supplements thereto) and the prospectus (including,
 without limitation, all amendments and supplements thereto) used in connection with such Registration Statement shall not contain
 any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the

 or successor reports), the Company shall furnish to the Investor copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents
 (other than those filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the Securities Act) will be subject to the reasonable and prompt review
 of the Investor (in each of which cases, if such document contains material non-public information as consented to by the Investor
 pursuant to Section 6.13, the information provided to Investor will be kept strictly confidential until filed and treated as subject
 to Section 6.08). The Investor shall furnish comments on a Registration Statement and any related amendment and supplement to a Registration
 Statement to the Company within 24 hours of the receipt thereof. If the Investor fails to provide comments to the Company within
 such 24-hour period, then the Registration Statement, related amendment or related supplement, as applicable, shall be deemed accepted
 by the Investor in the form originally delivered by the Company to the Investor.

 final prospectus included in such Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto (or such other number of copies
 as the Investor may reasonably request) and (iii) such other documents as the Investor may reasonably request from time to time in
 order to facilitate the disposition of the Common Stock owned by the Investor pursuant to a Registration Statement. Filing of the
