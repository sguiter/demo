 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Statements made by us in this report and in other reports and statements released by us that are not historical facts constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the judgment of our senior management based on our current estimates, expectations, forecasts and projections and include comments that express our current opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results. Disclosures that use words such as believe, "may," anticipate, estimate, intend, could, plan, expect, project or the negative of these, as well as similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events, many of which are outside of our control, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results, performance or achievement, or industry results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties may include the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Any such forward-looking statements, whether made in this report or elsewhere, should be considered in the context of the various disclosures made by us about our businesses including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise. 
 Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Definitions 
 
 In addition to the results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") included within this report, Kennedy Wilson has provided certain information, which includes non-GAAP financial measures (including Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Net Operating Income, as defined below). Such information is reconciled to its closest GAAP measure in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and such reconciliations are included within this report. These measures may contain cash and non-cash gains and expenses and gains and losses from the sale of real-estate related investments. Consolidated non-GAAP measures discussed throughout this report contain income or losses attributable to non-controlling interests. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and Kennedy Wilson's shareholders in their analysis of the business and operating performance of the Company. Management also uses this information for operational planning and decision-making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures are not and should not be considered a substitute for any GAAP measures. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Kennedy Wilson may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents net (loss) income before interest expense, loss (gain) on early extinguishment of debt, the Company's share of interest expense included in unconsolidated investments, preferred dividends, depreciation and amortization, the Company's share of depreciation and amortization included in unconsolidated investments, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, the Company's share of taxes included in unconsolidated investments, share-based compensation expense for the Company and EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Please see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP measures for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income as reported under GAAP. The Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze its business because it adjusts net income for items the Company believes do not accurately reflect the nature of its business going forward or that relate to non-cash compensation expense or noncontrolling interests. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of the Company's results from operations. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing its operating performance, readers should use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use, as it does not remove all non-cash items or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amount shown for Adjusted EBITDA also differs from the amount calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.

 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) represents net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, the Company's share of depreciation and amortization included in unconsolidated investments, share-based compensation, and excluding net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, before depreciation and amortization. Please also see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations for a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to net income as reported under GAAP. The Company's management uses Adjusted Net Income to analyze its business because it adjusts net income for items the Company believes do not accurately reflect the nature of its business going forward or that relate to non-cash compensation expense or noncontrolling interests. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes Adjusted Net Income is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of the Company's results from operations. However, Adjusted Net Income is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing its operating performance, readers should use Adjusted Net Income in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Adjusted Net Income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use, as it does not remove all non-cash items or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. 
 
 Cap rate represents the net operating income of an investment for the year preceding its acquisition or disposition, as applicable, divided by the purchase or sale price, as applicable. Capitalization ("Cap") rates discussed in this report only include data from income-producing properties. The Company calculates cap rates based on information that is supplied to it during the acquisition diligence process. This information is not audited or reviewed by independent accountants and may be presented in a manner that is different from similar information included in the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, cap rates represent historical performance and are not a guarantee of future net operating income ("NOI"). Properties for which a cap rate is discussed may not continue to perform at that cap rate. 
 
 Carried interests refers to amounts that are allocated to the Company under its Funds and certain co-investment vehicles based on the cumulative performance of such venture See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements Unconsolidated Investments of the Company s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company s accounting of carried interests that it is entitled to under its Funds and certain co-investment vehicles. 
 
 Carried interests compensation refers to any carried interests earned by the Company to be allocated to certain employees of the Company, as approved by the compensation committee of the Company s board of directors. 
 
 Co-Investment Portfolio NOI refers to the Company's share of NOI that is generated from the properties in which the Company has an ownership interest and that are held in the Company's Co-Investment Portfolio business segment. Please also see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations for a reconciliation of Co-Investment Portfolio NOI to net income as reported under GAAP. 
 Consolidated Portfolio NOI refers to the NOI that is generated from the properties that the Company has an ownership interest in and are held in the Company's Consolidated Portfolio business segment. Please also see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations for a reconciliation of Consolidated Portfolio NOI to net income as reported under GAAP. 
 "Equity partners" refers to non-wholly-owned subsidiaries that are consolidated in the Company's financial statements under U.S. GAAP and third-party equity providers. 
 " Fee Bearing Capital" represents total third-party committed or invested capital that the Company manages in its joint-ventures, commingled funds and debt platform that entitle the Company to earn fees, including without limitation, asset management fees, construction management fees, acquisition and disposition fees and/or carried interest, if applicable. 
 Funds refers to certain commingled funds managed and sponsored by the Company that are investment companies under the ASC Topic 946, Financial Services. 
 
 "Gross Asset Value refers to the gross carrying value of assets, before debt, depreciation and amortization, and net of noncontrolling interests. 
 KWH, "KW," Kennedy Wilson, the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" refers to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the results of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries. 
 KWE refers to Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Limited. 
 "Net operating income" or " NOI is a non-GAAP measure representing the income produced by a property calculated by deducting certain property expenses from property revenues. The Company's management uses net operating income to 
 ii 

Table of Contents 

 assess and compare the performance of its properties and to estimate their fair value. Net operating income does not include the effects of depreciation or amortization or gains or losses from the sale of properties because the effects of those items do not necessarily represent the actual change in the value of the Company's properties resulting from its value-add initiatives or changing market conditions. Management believes that net operating income reflects the core revenues and costs of operating its properties and is better suited to evaluate trends in occupancy and lease rates. Please also see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations for a reconciliation of Net Operating Income to net income as reported under GAAP. 
 
 "Noncontrolling interests" represents the portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to Kennedy Wilson. 
 Principal co-investments consists of the Company s share of income or loss earned on investments in which the Company can exercise significant influence but does not have control. Income from unconsolidated investments includes income from ordinary course operations of the underlying investment, gains on sale, fair value gains and losses. 
 
 "Pro-Rata" represents Kennedy Wilson's share calculated by using our proportionate economic ownership of each asset in our portfolio. Please also refer to the pro-rata financial data in our supplemental financial information. 
 "Real Estate Assets under Management" ("AUM") generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which the Company provides (or participates in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, and investments in joint ventures. AUM is principally intended to reflect the extent of the Company's presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining management fees. AUM consists of the total estimated fair value of the real estate properties, total loan commitments made through the Company s debt investment platform, inclusive of both currently outstanding loan amounts and contractual future funding commitments, and other real estate related assets either owned by third parties, wholly-owned by the Company or held by joint ventures and other entities in which its sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested. The estimated value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. The accuracy of estimating fair value for investments cannot be determined with precision and cannot be substantiated by comparison to quoted prices in active markets and may not be realized in a current sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability (particularly given the ongoing macroeconomic conditions such as, but not limited to, recent adverse developments affecting regional banks and other financial institutions, ongoing military conflicts around the world and uncertainty with respect to, fluctuating interest rates continue to fuel recessionary fears and create volatility in Kennedy Wilson's business results and operations). Recently, there has also been a lack of liquidity in the capital markets as well as limited transactions which has had an impact on the inputs associated with fair values. Additionally, there are inherent uncertainties in any fair value measurement technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including capitalization rates, discount rates, liquidity risks, and estimates of future cash flows could significantly affect the fair value measurement amounts. All valuations of real estate involve subjective judgments. 
 
 Same property refers to stabilized consolidated and unconsolidated properties in which Kennedy Wilson has an ownership interest during the entire span of both periods being compared. This analysis excludes properties that during the comparable periods (i) were acquired, (ii) were sold, (iii) are either under development or undergoing lease up or major repositioning as part of the Company s asset management strategy, (iv) were investments in which the Company holds a minority ownership position, and (v) certain non-recurring income and expenses. The analysis only includes Office, Multifamily and Hotel properties, where applicable. To derive an appropriate measure of operating performance across the comparable periods, the Company removes the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods. Amounts are calculated using Kennedy Wilson s ownership share in the Company s consolidated and unconsolidated properties. Management evaluates the performance of the operating properties the Company owns and manages using a same property analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows management and investors to analyze (i) the Company s ongoing business operations and (ii) the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating the Company s properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Same property metrics are widely recognized measures in the real estate industry, however, other publicly-traded real estate companies may not calculate and report same property results in the same manner as the Company. Please also see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Certain Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations for a reconciliation of same property results to the most comparable measure reported under GAAP.

 years. This is consistent with how market participants often estimate values in connection with buying real estate but these holding periods can be shorter depending on the life of the structure an investment is held within. The cash flows include a projection of the net sales proceeds at the end of the holding period, computed using a market reversionary capitalization rate. For our investment in VHH the Company fair values its general partner ("GP") interests net cashflows utilizing a levered discount rate. 
 Under the direct capitalization approach, the Company applies a market derived capitalization rate to current and future income streams with appropriate adjustments for tenant vacancies or rent-free periods. These capitalization rates and future income streams are derived from comparable property and leasing transactions and are considered to be key inputs in the valuation. Other factors that are taken into consideration include tenancy details, planning, building and environmental factors that might affect the property. 
 The Company also utilizes valuations from independent real estate appraisal firms on some of its investments ("appraised valuations"), with certain investment structures requiring appraised valuations periodically (typically annually). All appraised valuations are reviewed and approved by the Company.

 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable including related party receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, accrued salaries and benefits, and deferred and accrued income taxes approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. The carrying value of loans (excluding related party loans as they are presumed not to be an arm s length transaction) approximates fair value as the terms are similar to loans with similar characteristics available in the market.

 The trust deed that governs the bonds contains various restrictive covenants for KWE, including, among others, limitations on KWE s and its material subsidiaries ability to provide certain negative pledges. The trust deed limits the ability of KWE and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness if, on the date of such incurrence and after giving effect to the incurrence of the new indebtedness, (1) KWE s consolidated net indebtedness (as defined in the trust deed) would exceed of KWE s total assets (as calculated pursuant to the terms of the trust deed); and (2) KWE s consolidated secured indebtedness (as defined in the trust deed) would exceed of KWE s total assets (as calculated pursuant to the terms of the trust deed). The trust deed also requires KWE, as of each reporting date, to maintain an interest coverage ratio (as defined in the trust deed) of at least to 1.00 and have unencumbered assets of no less than of its unsecured indebtedness (as defined in the trust deed). 
 As of September 30, 2024, KWE was in compliance with these covenants.

Company Overview 
 
 We are a real estate investment company with over 27.8 billion of Real Estate Assets Under Management AUM in high growth markets across the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland. With an objective of generating strong long-term risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders and partners and drawing on over three decades of experience in identifying opportunities and building value through various market cycles, in our markets, we focus on (i) investing in the rental housing sector (both market rate and affordable units) and industrial properties; and (ii) originating, managing and servicing real estate loans (primarily senior construction loans secured by high quality multifamily and student housing properties that are being developed by institutional sponsors throughout the United States). We have recently focused on growing our investment management and co-investment platform whereby we invest a minority position (with the potential for carried interest) and earn our pro-rata share of income as well as asset management fees in our role as asset manager. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our investment management platform generated a total of 69.0 million of asset management fees representing a growth of 51 over the same period in 2023. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our 246 employees managed a total of 27.8 billion (which includes a total of approximately 60,000 multifamily units we hold ownership interest in (39,000 units) or finance (21,000 units)) of AUM. Over the past several years, in line with our focus on the growth of our investments in housing (including the launch of our new 1 billion single-family home rental joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CPPIB as further discussed below) and the continued execution of our capital recycling plan and our recent non-core asset disposition plan, our global investment portfolio has significantly evolved to be weighted heavily in equity and debt investments in the rental housing sector (multifamily, both market rate and affordable, and student housing). The table below details key metrics and information of our global investment portfolio (in total and in each of our segments):

 As of September 30, 2024, the 26.6 billion of operating properties and real estate loans within our AUM produced total revenue of 1.5 billion (KW's share of which was 551.4 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 22.7 billion of operating properties and real estate loans with total revenue of 1.2 billion (KW's share of which was 549.4 million) during the same period in 2023. Our global team, located in offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Japan, also managed the consummation of 347.1 million of gross acquisitions (KW share of 19.9 and originated 2.1 billion of construction loans (KW share of 52.3 million) which will fund at future dates and funded 715.8 million (KW share of 32.6 million) on previously originated loans. We also had 649.8 million of gross dispositions and 524.7 million of loan repayments (KW's ownership interest of 81.0 and 5 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our business is comprised of two segments. 
 43 

Table of Contents 

Our Consolidated Portfolio (as defined below) includes primarily wholly-owned multifamily communities, office and retail properties. Our ownership interests in such consolidated properties make up our Consolidated Portfolio ("Consolidated Portfolio") business segment as discussed in detail throughout this report. 
 
 In addition to investing our shareholder's capital, we invest capital on behalf of our partners in real estate and real estate related assets through our Co-Investment Portfolio ("Co-Investment Portfolio"). This fee-bearing capital represents total third-party committed or invested capital that we manage in our joint ventures and commingled funds that entitle us to earn fees, including without limitation, asset management fees, construction management fees, acquisition and disposition fees. Additionally, with respect to certain of these structures that we manage and invest our capital in, alongside our equity partners, we have the potential to receive carried interest on our equity investment in such co-investment structures. As of September 30, 2024, our fee-bearing capital was 8.8 billion and we recognized 69.0 million in base investment management fees and had 24.1 million in net accrued carried interests receivable (allocated amounts to us on co-investments we managed based on the cumulative performance of the underlying investment), which included a write down of 45.1 million of carried interests during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We generally invest in the joint ventures and commingled funds that we manage. 
 In our Co-Investment Portfolio, 93 of our carrying value is accounted for at fair value. Our interests in such joint ventures and commingled funds and the fees that we earn from such vehicles make up our Co-Investment Portfolio segment as discussed in detail throughout this report. 
 In addition to our income-producing real estate, we also engage in development, redevelopment and value add initiatives through which we enhance cash flows or reposition assets to increase value. Our total share of development project costs with respect to these investments are estimated at 33.0 million over the next two years. These costs are generally financed by cash from our balance sheet, capital provided by partners (if applicable), cash flows from investment and construction loans. Cost overrun risks are reduced by detailed architectural plans, guaranteed price contracts and supervision by expert Company executives and personnel. When completed, the construction loans are generally replaced by long-term mortgage financing. See additional detail in the section titled Development and Redevelopment below. 
 Investment Approach 
 The following is our investment approach: 
 Identify markets with an attractive investment landscape and the potential for growth 
 Establish operating platforms in our target markets 
 Develop local intelligence and create and maintain long-lasting relationships, primarily with financial institutions and the brokerage community 
 Leverage relationships and local knowledge to drive proprietary investment opportunities with a focus on off-market transactions that we expect will result in above average cash flows and returns over the long term 
 Acquire high quality assets, primarily through our investment management platform with strategic partners and funds that we manage 
 Reposition assets to enhance cash flows post-acquisition 
 Explore development opportunities or acquire development assets that fit within our overall investment strategy 
 Continuously evaluate and selectively harvest asset and entity value through strategic realizations using both the public and private markets 
 
 Quarter to Date and Year to Date Highlights 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we achieved the following: 
 Completed the lease-up of and stabilized two multifamily communities in the Western U.S. totaling 512 units. 
 Originated 421.5 million 10.5 million at our share) of new senior construction loans through our debt investment platform 
 Generated total investment management fees of 21.6 million, an increase of 39 from the third quarter of 2023 
 Continued to see strength in our stabilized multifamily portfolio which saw same-store occupancy grow by 0.8 to 94.9 , same-property revenue growth of 3.3 , and same-property NOI growth of 3.0 
 Renewed our existing 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility to a new 550 million facility 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders of 77.4 million as compared to a net loss attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders of 92.2 million for the same period in 2023. These results include 64.0 million and 119.2 million of non-cash expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, which primarily consist of depreciation and amortization and changes in fair value. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 we had Adjusted

Table of Contents 

 EBITDA of 66.4 million as compared to 33.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net income attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was also due to a 53.7 million increase in the Company s income from unconsolidated investments as a result of lower fair value declines on unconsolidated investments and an increase in investment management fees due to the growth of our investment management platform. These increases were offset by lower NOI from hotel operations due to the sale of the Shelbourne in the first quarter of 2024, lower gains on sale of real estate and fair value losses on interest rate derivatives during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior period. 
 
 During the nine months September 30, 2024, we achieved the following: 
 Originated 2.1 billion of new senior construction loans through our debt investment platform 
 Generated total investment management fees of 69.0 million, an increase of 51.3 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Continued to see strength in our stabilized multifamily portfolio which saw same-store occupancy grow by 0.4 to 94.5 , same-property revenue growth of 3.3 , and same-property NOI growth of 2.6 
 Generated 375 million of cash from asset sales and loan repayments (excluding closing costs) 
 Grew Fee-Bearing Capital by 7 to a record 8.8 billion 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders of 109.6 million as compared to a net loss attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders of 94.0 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we had Adjusted EBITDA of 348.9 million as compared to 319.2 million for the same period in 2023. These results include 180.6 million and 246.0 million of non-cash expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, which primarily consist of depreciation and amortization and changes in fair values. There was also lower NOI from hotel operations as the Shelbourne hotel was sold in the first quarter 2024 and we also had lower fair value gains on interest rate derivatives during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These decreases were offset by higher investment management fees and interest income from our real estate lending platform. 
 
 In our Co-Investment portfolio, we had 19.4 million of realized operating results and recorded non-cash unrealized fair value and carried interests declines of 64.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 39.9 million of realized operating performance and 109.6 million of non-cash unrealized fair value and carried interest declines during the same period in 2023. We had fair value losses and carried interests write downs primarily relating to lower market assumptions of vacancy and rental growth on office properties in the Western United States, Ireland and United Kingdom. Declines in certain office investments in our United States commingled funds also led to the reversal of previously accrued carried interests. Such fair value losses were offset by a 29.7 million fair value increase on our minority investment in Zonda which closed a merger transaction during the first quarter of 2024. This transaction led to cost synergy opportunities and increase in earnings in that business. Operating results in our Co-Investments portfolio declined due to losses at recently completed development projects as they work towards stabilizing operations and occupancy. The properties were not in service in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and any costs associated with the properties were capitalized as they were still under development during such period. 
 In order to help the user of the financial statements understand our company, we have included certain five-year selected financial data. The following table shows selected financial items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 dating back to 2020.

 Business Segments 
 As briefly described above, our operations are defined by two business segments: our Consolidated Portfolio and our Co-Investment Portfolio. 
 Our Consolidated Portfolio consists of the investments in real estate and real estate-related assets that we have made and consolidate on our balance sheet. We typically wholly-own the assets in our Consolidated Portfolio. 
 Our Co-Investment Portfolio consists of (i) the co-investments in real estate and real estate-related assets, including loans secured by real estate, that we have made through the commingled funds and joint ventures that we manage; (ii) fees (including, without limitation, asset management fees and construction management fees, and/or acquisition and disposition fees); and (iii) carried interests. We typically have a 5 to 50 ownership interest in the assets in our Co-Investment Portfolio. We have a weighted average ownership in our Co-Investment Portfolio assets of 40 as of September 30, 2024. 
 In addition to our two primary business segments, our Corporate segment includes, among other things, our corporate overhead and our auction group. 
 Consolidated Portfolio 
 Our Consolidated Portfolio is a permanent capital vehicle focused on maximizing property cash flow. These assets are primarily wholly-owned and tend to have longer hold periods and we target investments with accretive asset management opportunities. 
 The non-GAAP table below represents a summarized balance sheet of our Consolidated Portfolio, which is held at historical depreciated cost as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This table does not include amounts from our corporate segment such as corporate cash and the KWI Notes.

 Co-Investment Portfolio 
 Our Co-Investment Portfolio consists of (i) the co-investments in real estate and real estate-related assets, including loans secured by real estate, that we have made through the commingled funds, joint ventures and platforms that we manage; (ii) fees (including, without limitation, asset management fees, construction management fees, and/or acquisition and disposition fees); and (iii) carried interests. We utilize different platforms in the Co-Investment Portfolio segment depending on the asset and risk return profiles.

 Separate accounts 
 We have several equity partners for whom we act as the general partner and receive investment management fees, including asset management, acquisition, disposition, financing, construction management, and other fees. In addition to acting as the asset manager and general partner of those joint ventures, we are also a co-investor in these properties. Our separate account platforms have defined investment parameters such as asset types, leverage and return profiles and expected hold periods. As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average ownership interest in the various joint ventures that we manage was 44 . 
 Commingled funds 
 We currently have investments in four closed end funds that we manage and receive investment management fees. We focus on sourcing investors in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Japan and investments in the U.S. and Europe with respect to our commingled funds. Each of our funds have, among other things, defined investment guidelines, investment hold periods and target returns. Currently our three U.S. based funds focus on value-add properties that have an expected hold period of 5 to 7 years. Our European fund focuses on value-add commercial properties in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain that also have expected hold periods of 5 to 7 years. As of September 30, 2024, our weighted average ownership interest in the commingled funds that we manage was 13 . 
 VHH 
 Through our Vintage Housing Holdings ("VHH") partnership we acquire and develop income and age restricted properties. See a detailed discussion of this business in the Multifamily section below. 
 Investment Types 
 The following are the product types we invest in through our Consolidated Portfolio and Co-Investment Portfolio segments: 
 Multifamily and Rental Housing 
 We pursue multifamily acquisition opportunities where we can unlock and enhance asset value through a myriad of strategies, including institutional management, asset renovation and rehabilitation, repositioning and creative recapitalization. We focus primarily on apartment communities in supply-constrained, infill markets. 
 Our global multifamily portfolio has 38,771 units as of September 30, 2024, consisting of 36,381 stabilized units and 2,390 units that are undergoing lease up or are in the process of being developed. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we hold ownership interests in 151 assets that include 9,928 consolidated market rate multifamily apartment units, 16,358 market rate units within our Co-Investment Portfolio and 12,485 affordable units in our VHH platform. The unit counts above include units that are unstabilized and undergoing development.

Table of Contents 

 Our largest Western United States multifamily regions are the Mountain West region (which includes our investments in Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico) and the Pacific Northwest (primarily the state of Washington). The remainder of the Western United States portfolio is located in Northern and Southern California. In Ireland we focus on Dublin city center and the suburbs of the city. 
 Our asset management strategy entails installing strong property management teams to drive leasing activity and upkeep of the properties. We also add amenities designed to promote health and wellness, celebrate local and cultural events and enhance the lives of residents living in our communities. We also incorporate spaces for rest and socialization across our global multifamily portfolio, including clubhouses, fitness centers, business suites, outdoor play areas, pools and dog parks. Lastly, we utilize real-time market data and artificial intelligence based applications to ensure we are attaining current market rents. 
 
 In addition, subsequent to the reporting period, we announced the launch of a new UK single-family rental housing joint-venture with CPPIB, targeting 1 billion in real estate. CPPIB will own 90 of the ownership interests in the joint venture, initially committing 500 million in equity to the joint venture and we will own 10 of the ownership interests initially committing 56 million in equity. This joint venture will look to acquire single-family rental properties throughout the UK, targeting areas with strong and growing local economies. 
 Multifamily - Affordable Housing 
 Through our VHH platform we focus on affordable units based on income and in some cases age restrictions. With homes reserved for residents that make 50 to 60 of the area s median income, VHH provides an affordable long-term solution for qualifying working families and active senior citizens, coupled with modern amenities that are a hallmark of our traditional multifamily portfolio. Fundamental to VHH s success is a shared commitment to delivering quality affordable homes and building communities that enrich residents lives, including providing programs such as social support groups, after-school programs, transportation assistance, computer training, and wellness classes. 
 
 We hold an approximate 50 interest in VHH which acts as the general partner ("GP interest") (developer/asset manager) of 59 affordable housing projects totaling 12,485 units (46 investments held with a tax credit limited partner ("tax credit LP") and 13 investments held fee simple which does not have any outside tax credit LPs. Included in the portfolio are 10,825 operating units and 1,660 units that are under development or lease up. When we acquired VHH in 2015, the portfolio consisted of a total of 5,485 units. These units are included in our multifamily unit count discussed throughout this report. 
 
 With respect to the assets that are held with tax credit LPs, VHH generally sells 99.9 of the legal ownership interest in the applicable asset to the tax credit LPs, in exchange for cash that is used to build and/or rehabilitate the property. Although legal ownership interests in these assets are sold to the tax credit LPs, VHH continues to receive a majority of the cash flow generated from these assets through deferred developer fees and other fee arrangements and profits splits agreed to between VHH and the tax credit LPs (a structure which is commonly used by peer companies with similar businesses). This results in VHH maintaining on average 75 of the economic ownership interests in the assets throughout the portfolio. 
 
 Our VHH platform also has a development component where we find suitable sites and develop properties from the ground up and then lease up the property upon the completion of construction. VHH is paid developer fees for its work as development manager and receive a conversion fee when the property is placed into operation. 
 
 Further, on properties where tax credits are sold, VHH typically utilizes tax-exempt bond financing to help finance its partnership investments. Typical financing includes a bridge to permanent financing solution, where a floating rate option is utilized during the construction and lease-up period and a permanent loan with a fixed rate locked at the time of closing becomes effective upon conversion/stabilization. The typical term for these loan facilities is 17 years. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received 7.4 million of proceeds from VHH from recurring monthly distributions. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have received 54.8 million of proceeds from VHH, including 10.1 million from recurring monthly distributions, 5.6 million from paid developer fees at conversion and 39.1 million from sales and refinancings. 
 
 We acquired our ownership interest in VHH in 2015 for approximately 80.0 million. As of September 30, 2024 we have contributed an additional 167.1 million into VHH and have received 364.0 million in cash distributions. VHH is an unconsolidated investment that we account for using the fair value option which had a carrying value of 311.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Since our acquisition in 2015, we have recorded 338.9 million worth of fair value gains on our investment in VHH, including 18.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 The fair value of the real estate investments held through VHH is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis on a partnership-by-partnership basis. This methodology assumes ordinary distributions during the ownership period and the future sale of the underlying properties after the tax credit period has expired. Our methodology of estimating the fair value of such real estate investments assumes certain market inputs, including average capitalization rates at sale between 6.25 - 7.20 and discount rates ranging from 8.25 - 9.20 . 
 
 With respect to investments held by VHH with tax credit LPs, the discounted cash flow analysis also factors in the distinct economic splits between VHH and its tax credit LPs. We also record an estimated fair value of the our GP interests with respect to VHH ownership structures with tax credit LPs by taking the fair value of the underlying real estate utilizing the method described above and then factoring in (i) cashflow after debt service and then, (ii) discounting the net cashflow utilizing a levered discount rate that ranges between 15.00 to 19.50 (the "levered discount rates"). 
 
 With respect to investments held by VHH fee simple (without tax credit LPs), we also fair value the underlying secured loans on each of the properties, as described further below under Fair Value Investments . 
 
 In addition to completed projects, VHH holds certain investments that they are currently developing as described above. With respect to such investments VHH is paid developer fees for its work as development manager. Prior to the completion of the development, we estimate the fair value of these investments by applying the levered discount rate described above to the cashflow associated with the paid developer fees. Once complete, the property will be held by VHH with tax credit LPs and we will calculate and record the fair value of such investments utilizing the discounted cash flow methodology described in the previous paragraph. 
 Commercial 
 Our industrial portfolio is a key focus for new investments in our Co-Investment portfolio. Our current industrial portfolio consists mainly of last mile distribution centers located in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Mountain West and Northern California regions of the United States. 
 In our Consolidated Portfolio our office assets are typically large high-quality properties with high replacement costs. For office properties in our Co-Investment portfolio, we have a range of assets from suburban offices to office buildings located in central business districts of major cities. Some of our offices consist of flex space for medical lab work or light industrial use and many of our offices focus on tenants in the tech sector. 
 Our retail portfolio consists of suburban shopping centers with assets in the United Kingdom as well as Dublin and Western United States. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we hold investments in 51 office properties totaling over 10.6 million square feet, 117 industrial properties totaling 12.2 million square feet and 10 retail properties totaling 2.6 million square feet predominately in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with additional investments in the Pacific Northwest, Southern California and Italy. Our Consolidated portfolio held over 4.3 million square feet of office space and 1.1 million square feet of retail space. Our Co-Investment Portfolio has 6.3 million square feet of office space, 12.2 million square feet of industrial space and 1.5 million square feet of retail space. 
 
 Real Estate Credit 
 We have a global credit platform that has a total current capacity of 12 billion with 8.2 billion currently invested or committed to future fundings as of September 30, 2024. Our global credit platform, which includes institutional partners across insurance and sovereign wealth funds, invests across the entire real estate credit capital structure in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe and targets loans secured by high-quality real estate located in such jurisdictions. In our role as asset manager, we earn customary fees for managing the platform. Currently, our global credit investment platform investments have been made without the use of any leverage and are invested through our Co-Investment Portfolio. 
 The Construction Loan Portfolio consists of variable rate senior loans that are secured by high-quality, institutional commercial real estate, primarily multifamily and student housing properties, located across the U.S. capitalized by experienced, well-capitalized real estate owners and operators. Our construction loan originations typically finance 50 to 60 of the cost to construct the underlying properties, with loan fundings typically occurring after sponsor capital has been invested. The terms are generally three years with short-term, performance-based extension options. Interest typically accrues into principal balance during the construction period, with principal and interest being paid at maturity. The bridge loan portfolio consists of predominantly variable rate loans, with terms that are generally three-years with one or two 12 month extension options. Our bridge loans are secured by multifamily, office, retail, industrial and hotel assets in the Western United States or United Kingdom. We also invest in certain 
 51

 mezzanine loans that are fixed rate and tend to have maturities of 5 to 10 years and are secured by multifamily or office properties in the Western United States. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held interests in 117 loans, 84 that have floating interest rates, located in the United States and the United Kingdom, with an average interest rate to Kennedy Wilson of 8.7 per annum and an unpaid principal balance ("UPB") of 5.1 billion of real estate debt (of which our share was a UPB of 272.7 million). Some of our loans contain additional funding commitments that will increase our loan balances if they are utilized. As of September 30, 2024, our loans had unfulfilled capital commitments totaling 3.1 billion (our share of which was 102.4 million). In addition to interest income (which includes origination, exit and extension fees), we also earn customary asset management fees from our partners for managing these loan investments. 
 
 Due to certain prevailing market conditions or other circumstance on a case by case basis, we have stopped and may stop accruing for interest income if loans become non-performing and account for loans on a cash basis. In the event of a borrower defaulting on its obligations under any loan agreement, we will explore all options of recouping our loan investments including, without limitation, pursuing a foreclosure action to take control of the underlying collateral securing the loans, although there is no guarantee or assurance that we will be able to do so successfully. We have two loans (in our bridge loan portfolio) out of the 117 loans in our global debt platform with a 15.2 million carrying value at our share and net of any loan reserves that are not paying interest current on a contractual basis. Per the terms of the applicable loan agreements, however, we have implemented a full cash sweep of any cash flow that is generated from the collateral and are working on exercising our available remedies, which may include taking control of the underlying collateral. We are no longer accruing interest under these loans and accounting for them on a cash basis going forward. 
 
 As a result of market conditions, we expect more opportunities to arise in acquiring loan portfolios at a discount from their contractual balance due. We underwrite such loan portfolios based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral. Due to the discounted purchase price for such loans, we seek, and are generally able to, accomplish near term realization of the loan in a cash settlement or by obtaining title to the property. 
 
 Development and Redevelopment 
 We have a number of development, redevelopment and entitlement projects that are underway or in the planning stages. Unlike the residential projects that are held for sale and described in Residential and Other section below, these initiatives may ultimately result in income-producing assets. As of September 30, 2024, we have 498 multifamily units we are actively developing. If these projects are brought to completion, our estimated share of the total capitalization of these projects would be approximately 111 million (approximately 90 of which has already been funded), which we expect would be funded through our existing equity, third party equity, project sales, tax credit financing and secured debt financing. For the remainder of the year, we currently expect to spend an additional 33 million to develop to completion or complete the entitlement process on these projects. Of such 33 million, we currently expect 3 million of it to be funded through cash from us and the remaining to be financed with proceeds from investment level borrowings. This represents total capital over the life of the projects and is not a representation of peak capital and it does not take into account any distributions over the course of the investment. We and our equity partners are under no obligation to complete these projects and may dispose of any such assets after adding value through the entitlement process. Please also see the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources - Development and redevelopment section for additional detail on these investments. 
 
 Residential, Hotel and Other 
 In certain cases, we may pursue for-sale housing acquisition opportunities, including land for entitlements, finished lots, urban infill housing sites and partially finished and finished housing projects. On certain income-producing acquisitions, there are adjacent land parcels for which we may pursue entitlement activities or, in some cases, development or re-development opportunities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 13 investments that are primarily comprised of 1,069 residential acres located in Hawaii and the Western United States and are primarily invested through our Co-Investment Portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, these investments had a gross asset value of 265.5 million. These investments are in various stages of completion, ranging from securing the proper entitlements on land positions to sales of units/lots. 
 In our Co-Investment Portfolio, we have a five-star Rosewood flagged Kona Village Resort that consists of 150 rooms in Kona, Hawaii, which opened in July 2023.

Table of Contents 

 We have a minority ownership interest in Zonda, a technology based real estate business that offers residential construction data providing insights and solutions for leaders in the home building industry. We account for our ownership interest at fair value and it is included within our unconsolidated investments. 
 This group also includes our investment in liquid non-real estate investments which include investment funds that hold marketable securities and private equity investments. 
 
 Fair Value Investments 
 
 The Company accounts for a number of unconsolidated investments under fair value accounting. The accuracy of estimating fair value cannot be determined with precision and cannot be substantiated by comparison to quoted prices in active markets and may not be realized in a current sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Recently, there has also been a lack of liquidity in the capital markets as well as limited transactions which has had impact on the inputs associated with fair values. Additionally, there are inherent uncertainties in any fair value measurement technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including market-derived estimated capitalization rates, discount rates, liquidity risks, and estimates of future cash flows could significantly affect the fair value measurement amounts. All valuations of real estate involve subjective judgments. 
 
 Ongoing macroeconomic conditions, such as, but not limited to, elevated levels of inflation and interest rates, banks' ability and willingness to lend, recent adverse developments affecting regional banks and other financial institutions, currency fluctuations and ongoing military conflicts around the world, continue to fuel recessionary fears and create volatility in our business results and operations. Any prolonged downturn in the financial markets or a recession, either globally or locally in the United States or in other countries in which we conduct business, could impact the fair value of investments held by the Company. As a result of the rapid development, fluidity and uncertainty surrounding these situations, the Company expects that information with respect to fair value measurement may change, potentially significantly, going forward and may not be indicative of the actual impact on our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and future periods. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1.9 billion or 93 of our investments in our Co-Investment Portfolio (26 of total assets) were held at estimated fair value. As of September 30, 2024, there were cumulative fair value gains on investments held of 267.6 million, which comprises 14 of the 1.9 billion carrying value of fair value unconsolidated investments that are currently held. Our investment in VHH accounts for 338.9 million of the 267.6 million cumulative fair value gains. See discussion of VHH above for more detail. Fair value changes consist of changes in the underlying value of properties and associated mortgage debt as well as foreign currency fluctuations (net of any direct hedges) for non-dollar denominated investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 19.4 million and 45.1 million, respectively, of net non-cash fair value losses and write downs of carried interests on Co-Investment portfolio investments. 
 
 In determining estimated fair market values, the Company utilizes two approaches to value real estate, a discounted cash flow analysis and direct capitalization approach. 
 
 Discounted cash flow models estimate future cash flows from a buyer's perspective (including terminal values) and compute a present value using a market discount rate. The holding period in the analysis is typically ten years. Although the ten year holding period is consistent with how market participants often estimate values in connection with buying real estate, these holding periods can be shorter depending on the life of the structure an investment is held within. The cash flows include a projection of the net sales proceeds at the end of the holding period, computed using a market reversionary capitalization rate. 
 
 Under the direct capitalization approach, the Company applies a market derived capitalization rate to current and future income streams with appropriate adjustments for tenant vacancies or rent-free periods. These capitalization rates and future income streams are derived from comparable property and leasing transactions and are considered to be key inputs in the valuation. Other factors that are taken into consideration include tenancy details, planning, building and environmental factors that might affect the property. 
 
 The Company also utilizes valuations from independent real estate appraisal firms on some of its investments ("appraised valuations"), with certain investment structures periodically (typically annually) requiring appraised valuations. All appraised valuations are reviewed and approved by the Company.

In valuing indebtedness, the Company considers significant inputs to be the term of the debt, value of collateral, market loan-to-value ratios, market interest rates and spreads, and credit quality of investment entities. The credit spreads used by the Company to value floating rate indebtedness range from 2.00 to 4.60 , while the market rates used to value fixed rate indebtedness range from 4.10 to 9.30 . 
 
 There is no active secondary market for our development projects and no readily available market value given the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future cash flows. Accordingly, our determination of fair value of our development projects requires judgment and extensive use of estimates. Therefore, we typically use investment cost as the estimated fair value until future cash flows become more predictable. Additionally, the fair value of our development projects may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. If we were required to liquidate an investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized or incurred on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the currently assigned valuations. 
 Real Estate Assets Under Management (AUM) 
 AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, and investments in joint ventures. Our AUM is principally intended to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our AUM consists of the total estimated fair value of the real estate properties and other real estate related assets either owned by third parties, wholly-owned by us or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in our AUM. The estimated value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. 
 The table below details the changes in the Company's AUM for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

The increase is due to the inclusion of future loan commitments, asset acquisitions in our comingled funds and loan fundings in our debt platform. These increases were offset by consolidated asset sales and fair value losses in our Co-Investment portfolio.

 GAAP net loss to common shareholders was 77.4 million and 92.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in GAAP net income to common shareholders is primarily due to lower non-cash fair value losses on unconsolidated investments in the current period as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 66.2 million and 33.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Foreign Exchange - Results of Operations 
 A significant portion of our investments are located outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rates we hedge some of our exposure. However, we typically do not hedge future operations or cash flows and, therefore, changes in foreign currency rates will have an impact on our results of operations. We have included the table below to illustrate the impact these fluctuations have had on our revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA by applying the relevant exchange rates for the prior period. Please refer to the Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies section in Item 3 for a discussion of risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy and the "Other Comprehensive Income" section below for a discussion of the balance sheet impact of foreign currency movements on our results of operations.

 Consolidated Portfolio Segment 
 Rental income was 97.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 102.4 million for the same period in 2023. The 4.6 million decrease is primarily due to asset sales the majority of which were non-core assets in Europe and the Western United States, as well as deconsolidations of multifamily properties in the prior year as a result of asset recapitalizations that resulted in the Company not maintaining sole control of the investments and the investments moving to our investment management business. These decreases have been offset by certain multifamily developments that have been completed and are now operating properties. 
 Hotel income was 16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable activity in the current period as our sole consolidated hotel the Shelbourne was sold in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Gain on sale of real estate, net was 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 30.4 million during the same period in 2023. The gain on sale of real estate, net in the current period primarily related to the sale of an equity interest and deconsolidation of a multifamily property in the Western United States. The gain recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the sale of a multifamily property in the Western United States. The gain on sale of real estate, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 includes an impairment loss of 3.2 million on non-core retail assets that are being marketed for sale in Ireland and the United Kingdom with no comparable activity in the current period. 
 Rental expenses was 39.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 38.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is due to inflationary increases on items like payroll, utilities and insurance. 
 Hotel expenses was 9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable activity in the current period due to the sale of Shelbourne hotel as discussed above. 
 Compensation and related expenses decreased to 7.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 13.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher allocations of overhead expenses to the Co-Investments segment as there were lower gains on sale of real estate, net in the current period and the Co-Investment segment had increased investment management fees from the growth of the construction lending business. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased to 3.7 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher allocations of overhead expenses to the Co-Investment segment as discussed above. 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased to 36.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 38.8 million for the same period in 2023 due to sales and deconsolidations of consolidated assets as discussed above. 
 
 Interest expense was 41.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 40.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on certain mortgages which were partially offset by a decrease in consolidated mortgage balances due to asset sales and deconsolidations. Additionally, we hold certain interest rate derivatives that are currently in the money and we are receiving cash payments to offset increase in interest rates. These cash payments are recorded in other loss as a component of fair value movements on undesignated interest rate derivatives. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company received 4.8 million and 5.0 million, respectively, in cash payments from its interest rate derivatives on consolidated mortgages. The Company views interest expense net of the impact of interest rate derivatives as part of its interest rate risk analysis.

 Other loss was 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded mark to market fair value losses of 2.3 million on undesignated interest rate caps and swap contracts associated with consolidated investments held in the current period primarily at KWE. We received 4.8 million in cash payments on these derivatives during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We entered into these undesignated contracts to hedge against rising interest rates. We also had realized foreign exchange losses of 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Other loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to mark to market fair value losses of 4.5 million and received 5.0 million in cash payments. 
 Co-Investment Portfolio Segment 
 Investment Management 
 We receive fees, including asset management fees, construction management fees, and/or acquisition and disposition fees, for managing assets in our Co-Investment Portfolio on behalf of our partners. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had fees recorded through revenues of 21.6 million as compared to 15.5 million for the same period in 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase primarily related to higher base management fees as a result of having more AUM in our Co-Investment Portfolio mainly from the growth of in our global credit platform and Western United States multifamily separate accounts. 
 Loan income increased to 7.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 8.6 million for the same period in 2023. These amounts represent our share of interest income on loan investments within our global real estate credit platform and the increase is due to the growth of the platform. We recognized 1.5 million and 2.5 million of reserves against our loan portfolio in other loss during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Co-investment operations 
 In addition to our management of investments in the Co-Investment Portfolio, we have ownership interests in the properties that sit within our Co-Investment Portfolio. The table below represents a breakout of the amounts within income from unconsolidated investments which represents our share of underlying property investments in the Co-Investment Portfolio assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Revenue Rental 73.9 65.0 Hotel 8.6 4.6 Sale of real estate 12.5 1.2 Total revenue 95.0 70.8 Fair value/other adjustments (10.4) (61.8) Carried interests (16.4) (17.9) Expenses Rental 24.1 21.2 Hotel 9.3 7.8 Cost of real estate sold 13.7 0.7 Depreciation and amortization 1.0 0.8 Total expenses 48.1 30.5 Interest expense (34.1) (25.9) Other loss (6.1) (9.2) Benefit from income taxes 0.5 Loss from unconsolidated investments (20.1) (74.0) 
 The increase in income from unconsolidated investments is primarily due to the following: 
 
 Operating performance 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an increase in rental and hotel revenue of 12.9 million as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of the recapitalization of certain previously 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 consolidated multifamily properties that are now a part of our co-investment portfolio and increased operations as Kona Village. This increase in rental revenue was offset by: (i) higher interest expense due to changes in the contractual interest rates of our indebtedness and (ii) costs associated with the ongoing stabilization of the of Kona Village Resort and certain of our European properties that were recently developed and are in the process of being leased. 
 
 Fair Value 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded non-cash fair value losses with a decrease of less than 1 in fair values. The minor decreases primarily related to: (i) certain office properties located in Ireland, United States and the United Kingdom due to a higher market assumptions of vacancy and lower rental growth rates; (ii) certain market rate multifamily properties in the Western United States because lowered growth on NOI; and (iii) declines in the fair value of debt and interest rate hedges as mortgages move closer to their maturity dates. These fair value decreases were offset by (i) fair value increases at VHH due to increased NOI at the properties and lowered cost of capital associated with the business due to decreases in interest rates (ii) fair value increases related to our investment in Zonda due to increased EBITDA from its recently completed merger and (iii) fair value increases on foreign exchange movements, net of hedges on our euro and GBP denominated fair value investments. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a 16.4 million decrease in the accrual for carried interests primarily related to the fair value decreases that we recorded on (i) commingled funds in the United States due to declines in the value of office assets (as discussed above) and (ii) certain separate account platforms that hold multifamily assets in the Western United States primarily due to changes in the projected lengths of hold. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , we recorded non-cash fair value declines of approximately 3 in fair values. The decreases primarily related to: (i) office properties in Western United States, Ireland and the United Kingdom due to cap rate expansion which also led to us recording a decrease of the accrued performance allocations with respect to funds that held these investments as discussed below; (ii) certain market rate multifamily properties in the Western United States and Ireland because of increased interest rates leading to cap rate expansion; (iii) a national co-working office tenant no longer paying rent on a building that we hold a 10 ownership interest in; and (iv) foreign exchange losses, net of hedges on declines in the euro. These fair value decreases were offset by (i) fair value increases with respect to our investment in VHH (our affordable rate multifamily platform) due to gains on fixed rate debt held at rates below current market ones and (ii) recorded fair value increases on certain of our development projects located in Dublin, Ireland as we are near completion in such projects. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 17.9 million decrease in carried interests primarily related to the fair value decreases that we recorded on commingled funds in the United States and Europe due to declines in the value of office assets (as discussed above) and separate account platforms that hold multifamily and industrial assets. 
 
 Please also see Part I. Item 1. "Fair Value Investments" for additional details. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 Co-Investment Portfolio expenses increased to 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase compared to the prior period was primarily due to higher allocation of corporate expenses due to the acquisition of the PWB real estate credit business. 
 Corporate 
 Expenses decreased to 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower stock based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest expense was 25.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 23.4 million for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had higher average outstanding balance drawn on the line of credit. 
 
 Other (loss) income decreased to a loss 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other income of 8.1 million for the same period in 2023. During the current reporting period, we recorded mark to market fair value decreases of 3.8 million on interest rate caps and swaps that the Company bought to hedge its variable rate interest rate exposure compared to an increase of 3.2 million in the prior period. The fair value of these contracts has declined period over period as the expectation of future interest rate hikes has declined, the maturity dates of some of our contracts are closer in time than in the prior period and we are starting to receive payments on such contracts. We received 2.0 million and 2.5 million in 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 cash payments on these contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we also had (i) a 4.4 million realized foreign exchange loss on Company's portion of line of credit drawn in euros as the value of the euro has increased against the U.S. dollar and (ii) a 0.5 million increase in interest income on bank deposits as we have earned higher interest on our cash deposits. 
 
 Our income tax benefit was 10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 19.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in income tax benefit is primarily attributable to additional valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax asset on the outside basis difference of its investment in KWE recorded during the current period. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.8 as compared to an effective tax rate of 23.5 for the same period in 2023. Significant items impacting the quarterly tax provision include: tax charges associated with non-deductible executive compensation under IRC Section 162(m) and additional valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax asset on the outside basis difference of its investment in KWE. 
 Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income 
 The two major components that drive the change in other comprehensive loss are the change in foreign currency rates and the gain or loss of any associated foreign currency hedges. Please refer to the Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies section in Item 3 for a discussion of our risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy. Below is a table that details the activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 Net loss attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders (77.4) (92.2) Unrealized foreign currency translation gains (losses), net of noncontrolling interests and tax 37.4 (32.0) Unrealized foreign currency derivative contract (losses) gains, net of noncontrolling interests and tax (5.2) 4.7 Comprehensive loss attributable to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. common shareholders (45.2) (119.5) 
 
 The main currencies that we have exposure to are the euro and pound sterling. The table below represents the change in rates over the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as compared to the U.S. Dollar: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Euro 3.9 (2.5) GBP 6.0 (1.0) 
 
 Comprehensive loss, net of taxes and noncontrolling interests, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a loss of 45.2 million and 119.5 million, respectively. The Company experienced net unrealized gains on foreign currency through other comprehensive income for the period due to strengthening of the euro against the GBP and the U.S. Dollar. These translation gains were offset by hedge losses the Company has on its GBP denominated investments.

 Foreign Exchange - Results of Operations 
 A significant portion of our investments are located outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rates we hedge some of our exposure. However we typically do not

 hedge future operations or cash flows and, therefore, changes in foreign currency rates will have an impact on our results of operations. We have included the table below to illustrate the impact these fluctuations have had on our revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA by applying the relevant exchange rates for the prior period. Please refer to the Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies section in Item 3 for a discussion of risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy and the "Other Comprehensive Income" section below for a discussion of the balance sheet impact of foreign currency movements on our results of operations.

 Consolidated Portfolio Segment 
 
 Rental income decreased to 293.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 315.6 million for the same period in 2023. The 22.6 million decrease is primarily due to asset sales the majority of which were non-core assets in Europe and Western United States as well as deconsolidations of multifamily properties in the prior year due to the sale of equity interests to strategic partners and the Company no longer having control of the investment. 
 Hotel income was 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 42.7 million for the same period in 2023. The 33.4 million decrease is due to the sale of the Shelbourne hotel in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Gain on sale of real estate, net was 112.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 138.6 million during the same period in 2023. The gain recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to the sale of the Shelbourne hotel which resulted in a gain of 99.1 million; (ii) the sale of a building that is part of a larger office park which resulted in a gain of 21.6 million; (iii) the sale of a 90 interest and deconsolidation of a multifamily property and recognized a gain of 8.1 million; and (iv) the remainder of gain on sale of real estate relates to the sale of non-core retail in the United Kingdom. The gain on sale of real estate, net includes an impairment loss of 14.2 million relating to non-core office and retail buildings in the United Kingdom and Spain that were marketed for sale during such period. The gain recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 relates to the sale of equity interests in three Western United States multifamily properties into various co-investment platforms which triggered deconsolidation as described above and the sale of non-core retail assets in the United Kingdom and Western United States and a residential investment in the Western United States. These gains are net of 10.6 million of impairments relating to retail assets in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Western United States that have been identified for sale. 
 Rental expenses decreased to 113.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 113.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is due to sales and deconsolidation of properties as discussed above which were offset by inflationary increases on items like payroll, utilities and insurance. 
 Hotel expenses decreased to 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the sale of the Shelbourne hotel in the first quarter of 2024. 
 Compensation expense was 25.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 36.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower discretionary and deferred compensation accruals in the current period. 
 General and administrative expenses were 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. While general and administrative expenses were up overall for the year, the consolidated segment decreased, as there was a lower allocation of corporate expenses to the Consolidated segment in the current period due to the growth of the Co-Investments segment which received a higher allocation in the current period. 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased to 112.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 118.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of the Company being a net seller of assets over the last year.

Table of Contents 

Interest expense was 120.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 119.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase is due to increases in market interest rates. Additionally, we hold certain interest rate derivatives that are currently in the money and we are receiving cash payments to offset the increase in interest rates. These cash payments are recorded in other income/loss as a component of fair value movements on undesignated interest rate derivatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 14.4 million in cash payments from its interest rate derivatives on consolidated mortgages. The Company views interest expense net of the impact of interest rate derivatives as part of its interest rate risk analysis. 
 Other loss was 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other income of 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had mark to market fair value increases of 2.8 million on the Company's undesignated interest rate caps and swap contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.9 million declines in the prior period. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also had a 3.7 million loss on foreign exchange transactions and 2.0 million loss on one-time costs at properties for personnel and former tenants. 
 Co-Investment Portfolio Segment 
 Investment Management 
 We receive asset management fees for managing assets on behalf of our partners on our Co-Investment Portfolio assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had fees recorded through revenues of 69.0 million as compared to 45.6 million from the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase primarily related to a 20.4 million of acquisition fees that we earned on the origination of construction loans in the current period. We also had higher base management fees as a result of having more AUM in our Co-Investment Portfolio mainly from the growth of our global credit platform and Western United States multifamily separate accounts. Carried interests are recorded as part of income from unconsolidated investments and discussed below. 
 Loan income increased to 23.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.0 million for the same period in 2023. These amounts represent interest income on our share of loan investments within our global real estate credit platform and the increase is due to the growth of the platform. These increases were offset by a 10.0 million general reserve that we recorded in other income on our loan portfolio relating to our bridge loan portfolio as market conditions indicate that there could be potential credit losses due to the current interest rate environment and general market conditions. 
 Co-Investment Operations 
 In addition to our management of investments in the Co-Investment Portfolio, we have ownership interests in the properties that sit within our Co-Investment Portfolio. The table below represents a breakout of the amounts within income from unconsolidated investments which represents our share of underlying property investments in the Co-Investment Portfolio assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023:

 The increase in income from unconsolidated investments is primarily due to the following: 
 Operating performance 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an increase in rental and hotel revenue of 45.7 million as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of the recapitalization of certain previously consolidated multifamily properties that are now a part of our co-investment portfolio and the opening of the Kona Village Resort in July 2023. This increase in rental and hotel revenue was offset by: (i) higher interest expense due to changes in the contractual interest rates of our indebtedness and higher debt balances due to increase in assets in Co-Investment portfolio, (ii) costs associated with the ongoing stabilization of the Kona Village Resort and development properties in Europe that are in the process of leasing up and (iii) lower income from sales of residential units at our Kohanaiki development in Hawaii. 
 
 Fair Value 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded non-cash fair value losses with a decrease of approximately 1 in fair values. The minor decreases primarily related to: (i) certain office properties located in Ireland, United States and the United Kingdom due to higher market assumptions of vacancy and lower rental growth rates; (ii) non-cash fair value losses on mortgage debt and interest rate derivatives as previous fair value increases unwind as loans move closer to maturity dates. These fair value decreases were offset by fair value increases related to our investment in Zonda due to increased EBITDA from its recently completed merger and fair value increases in VHH due to increasing NOI at the properties and the reduction of cost of capital for the business as interest rates have come down. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded a 45.1 million decrease in the accrual for carried interests primarily related to the fair value decreases that we recorded with respect to (i) one of our Western United States commingled funds (as discussed above) and (ii) certain separate account platforms that hold multifamily assets in the Western United States primarily due to changes in the projected length of hold. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recorded non-cash fair value declines of approximately 4 in fair values. The decreases primarily related to: (i) office properties in Western United States, Ireland and United Kingdom due to cap rate expansion which also led to us recording a decrease of carried interests with respect to funds that held these investments as discussed below; (ii) certain market rate multifamily properties in the Western United States and Ireland because of increased interest rates leading to cap rate expansion; (iii) the write off of a 5 million investment in a social impact real estate fund manager and write down of our investment in Zonda due to decrease in operations; and (iv) a national co-working office tenant 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 no longer paying rent on a building that we hold a 10 ownership interest in. These fair value decreases were offset by (i) fair value increases with respect to our investment in VHH (our affordable rate multifamily platform) due to gains on the conversion of the status of one of VHH s largest properties from development to operating. Gains associated with the conversion of the loan secured by such property from a floating rate construction loan to a long-term fixed rate mortgage (the rate of which was set in 2019) and the resyndication of a property and the sale of retail units at one of its properties and (ii) recorded fair value increases on certain of our development projects located in Dublin, Ireland as we are near completion in such projects. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 36.3 million decrease in carried interests primarily related to the fair value decreases that we recorded with respect to two of our Western United States commingled funds as described above. We also had reductions in carried interests on market rate multifamily separate account platforms in the Western United States and Ireland. These decreases were offset by an increase in carried interests on our European commingled fund due to the increase in value associated with an investment held by such fund. 
 Expenses 
 Co-Investment Portfolio expenses increased to 30.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 26.1 million during the prior period. The increase compared to the prior period was primarily due to higher allocation of corporate expenses due to the growth of the real estate credit business. 
 Corporate 
 Expenses decreased to 35.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 43.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower share based compensation, discretionary and deferred compensation expense due to lower share price of the Company's stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior period in 2023. 
 Interest expense was 74.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 73.5 million for the same period in 2023. Interest expense was offset by 6.5 million and 5.4 million that we received on interest rate derivative contracts that paid out during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 recorded to other income which is discussed below 
 
 Other income decreased to 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.4 million for the same period in 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded mark to market fair value decreases of 3.9 million on interest rate caps and swaps that the Company bought to hedge its variable rate interest rate exposure as compared to a increase of 12.4 million in nine months ended September 30, 2023 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we received 2.0 million of interest income on bank deposits as compared to 3.3 million in the prior period. The Company also recorded realized foreign exchange losses of 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with a gain of 1.3 million in the prior period. 
 
 Our income tax expense was 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to income tax benefit of 13.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in income tax benefit is primarily attributable to a 14.4 million increase in worldwide pre-tax book income in 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negative 5.7 as compared to an effective tax rate of 22.6 for the same period in 2023. Significant items impacting the quarterly tax provision include: increase in valuation allowance against the Company s deferred tax asset on the outside basis difference of its investment in KWE, and tax charges associated with non-deductible executive compensation under IRC Section 162(m). 
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 The two major components that drive the change in other comprehensive loss are the change in foreign currency rates and the gain or loss of any associated foreign currency hedges. Please refer to the Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies section in Item 3 for a discussion of our risks relating to foreign currency and our hedging strategy. Below is a table that details the activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Comprehensive loss, net of taxes and noncontrolling interests, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a loss of 77.5 million and 91.2 million, respectively. The Company experienced net unrealized gains on foreign currency through other comprehensive income for the period due to the strengthening of the Euro and GBP against the US Dollar in the period. Hedge gains were due to hedges that KWE has on its euro denominated investments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources requirements include acquisitions of real estate and real estate related assets, funding development projects, loan draws (particularly on our construction loan business), capital expenditures for consolidated real estate and unconsolidated investments, working capital needs, interest and principal payments on our debt and dividends to our common and preferred shareholders. We finance these activities with internally generated funds through general operations including rental income, interest income, asset management fees, asset sales, borrowings under our revolving line of credit, sales of equity (common and preferred) and debt securities and cash out refinancings to the extent they are available and fit within our overall portfolio leverage strategy. Our investments in real estate are typically financed with equity from our balance sheet, third party equity and mortgage loans secured by that real estate. These mortgage loans are generally non-recourse in that, in the event of default, recourse will be limited to the mortgaged property serving as collateral, subject to limited customary exceptions. In some cases, we guarantee a portion of the loan related to a consolidated property or an unconsolidated investment, usually until some condition, such as completion of construction or leasing or certain net operating income criteria, has been met. We do not expect these guarantees to materially affect liquidity or capital resources. Please refer to the section titled " Off Balance Sheet Arrangements " for further information. 
 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties and loan investments, dividend payments to our common and preferred shareholders, interest on our unsecured corporate debt, development, redevelopment and capital expenditures and, potentially, share repurchases and acquisitions. We currently expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through our existing cash and cash equivalents plus capital generated from our investments, and sales of real estate as well as availability on our current revolving lines of credit. In addition, the Company s recently announced adjustment to its common stock dividend in May 2024 is expected to provide the Company with approximately 66 million of additional cash per year to capitalize on opportunities to grow its core business and/or repay outstanding indebtedness. Our need to raise funds from time to time to meet our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success and pace of the implementation of our strategy for strategic and accretive growth where appropriate. Additionally, we may opportunistically seek to raise capital (equity or debt) when we believe market conditions are favorable and when consistent with our growth and financing strategies. We may also seek third party financing to the extent that we engage in additional strategic investments, including in order to raise capital necessary to execute potential development or redevelopment strategies or acquire real estate, note portfolios, or other real estate related companies or real estate related securities. Similarly, we may from time to time seek to refinance our existing indebtedness opportunistically in order to reduce our overall cost of debt capital or optimize the maturity schedule of our outstanding indebtedness, or for other strategic reasons. We have an at-the-market ("ATM Program") pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of the Company s common stock in amounts and at times as the Company determines from time to time. We have 169.9 million available under this program at September 30, 2024. The Company has no obligation to sell any of such shares under its ATM Program. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of its common stock, the Company's determination of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company, and potential uses of funding available.

 As of September 30, 2024, we and our consolidated subsidiaries had 367.1 million 171.2 million of which is in foreign currencies of the EUR or the GBP) of consolidated cash (as shown on our consolidated balance sheet), our share of cash held at unconsolidated Co-Investment Portfolio assets of 143.7 million and had 373.5 million of availability under our revolving credit facility 176.5 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024). As of September 30, 2024, we have 105.1 million of restricted cash, which is included in cash and cash equivalents, that primarily relates to lender reserves associated with consolidated mortgages that we hold on properties and reserves held on loans in the Construction Loan Portfolio (as defined herein) on behalf of the borrowers under such loans. These reserves typically relate to interest, taxes, insurance and future capital expenditures at the properties as well as reserves held on our loan investments. 
 Additionally, we are subject to withholding taxes to the extent we repatriate cash from certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Under the KWE Notes covenants we have to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios to remain in compliance (see " Indebtedness and Related Covenants" for more detail on KWE Notes). Due to these covenants, we evaluate the tax and covenant implications before we distribute cash, which could impact the availability of funds at the corporate level. 
 
 As discussed throughout this report, ongoing macroeconomic conditions, such as, but not limited to, ongoing issues affecting regional and other financial institutions, high inflation and central banks raising interest rates to curtail high inflation continue to fuel recessionary fears and create volatility in our business results and operations, including our ability to access the capital markets at desired terms or at all. Please also see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Development and Redevelopment 
 Kennedy Wilson has a few remaining market rate development, redevelopment and entitlement projects that are underway or are in the planning stages. These initiatives, if completed, will result in market-rate income producing assets. As of September 30, 2024, we had 498 multifamily units we are actively developing. If these projects were brought to completion, our share of the total cost is estimated to be approximately 111 million, which we expect would be funded through our existing equity, third party equity, project sales and secured debt financing. This represents total capital over the life of the projects and is not a representation of peak equity and does not take into account any distributions over the course of the investment. As of September 30, 2024, we had incurred 100 million of costs to date and expect to spend an additional 33 million to develop to completion or complete the entitlement process on these projects. Of the 33 million of remaining costs to complete, we currently expect 3 million of it to be funded through cash from us over the life of the projects and the remaining to be financed with proceeds from investment level borrowings. These costs are generally financed by cash from our balance sheet, capital provided by partners (if applicable), cash flow from the investment and construction loans. Cost overrun risks are reduced by detailed architectural plans, guaranteed, or fixed price contracts and supervision by expert Company executives and personnel. When completed, the construction loans are generally replaced by long-term mortgage financing. When development projects are completed they typically move into our unstabilized category as they undergo lease up post-completion. 
 In addition to the market rate development and redevelopment projects described above, we have 1,660 affordable and/or age-restricted multifamily units within our VHH platform that we are currently developing or are in the process of stabilizing. We expect to have no cash equity basis in these projects at completion due to the use of property level debt and proceeds from the sale of tax credits. If these projects are brought to completion, we expect to receive 17.5 million in cash from paid developer fees and proceeds from the sale of tax credits. 
 The figures described in the two preceding paragraphs and in the table below are budgeted costs and are subject to change. There is no certainty that the Company will develop or redevelop any or all of these potential projects and the Company and its equity partners are under no obligation to complete these projects and may dispose of any such assets after adding value through the entitlement process. These are budgeted figures and are subject to change (increase or decrease) due to a number of factors (some of which are beyond our control), including, that these projects are being developed under construction management contracts with the general contractors and therefore we and our equity partners could be called upon to contribute additional capital in the event that actual costs exceed budgeted costs. The scope of these projects may also change. The estimated costs and amounts of cash to complete projects reflected in the table below represent management's current expectations and the total costs incurred to date include the land costs of these projects. 
 The table below describes the market rate development or redevelopment projects that the Company is undergoing or considering, and excludes the affordable and/or age-restricted multifamily units that it is developing in its VHH platform and its residential investments in millions).

 Unstabilized and Value Add Capital Expenditure Programs 
 
 We currently have seven assets that comprise 1.1 million commercial square feet, 232 multifamily units and 150 hotel rooms that are currently unstabilized and are undergoing various stages of lease up, value add or development. In order to stabilize these assets, we project our share of the costs to complete to be 21.5 million. The cost to complete this work and the time frame described is subject to many uncertainties that are beyond our control, and the actual costs may be significantly higher than the estimates shown below.

 (2) Estimated foreign exchange rates are 1.00 = 1.12 USD, and 1.00 = 1.34 USD related to NOI. 
 
 In addition to our development, redevelopment and stabilization initiatives we regularly implement a value-add approach to our consolidated and unconsolidated investments which includes rehabbing properties and adding or updating property amenities. The capital required to implement these value-add initiatives is typically funded with capital calls, refinancing or supplemental financings at the property level. We are not required to make these investments, but they are a key driver in our ability to increase net operating income at our properties post-acquisition. 
 Other Items 
 On March 20, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 250 million of our common stock. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through the net settlement of our restricted stock grants or otherwise, with the amount and timing of repurchases dependent on market conditions and subject to the Company s discretion. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and, subject to compliance with applicable laws, may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. On November 3, 2020,

 the Company's board of directors authorized an expansion of its existing 250 million share repurchase plan to 500 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 109.4 million remaining under the current plan for stock repurchases. Please also see "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds" section in Item 2. 
 The Company maintains a deferred compensation program for certain employees of the Company (the Deferred Compensation Program ). The compensation committee of the Company s board of directors approves an amount annually to be allocated to certain employees of the Company in the United States and in Europe. The amount allocated to each employee vests ratably over a three-year vesting period, subject to continued employment with the Company. Prior to 2022, half of the allocated amount was tied specifically to the performance and value of the Company s common stock at the time of each vesting Bonus Units ). Beginning 2022, the entire amount allocated to each employee consisted of Bonus Units. Under the Deferred Compensation Program, at the time of each vesting, the employees receive an amount equal to either the dividend yield of the Company s common stock or the actual amount of dividends paid on the Company common stock (in the case of Bonus Units) during the immediately preceding year on the amount that is subject to such vesting. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company recorded 5.2 million and 7.0 million, respectively, under the Deferred Compensation Program. 
 As discussed throughout this report, the Company also maintains a carried interests sharing program for certain employees of the Company (the Carried Interests Sharing Program ). The compensation committee of the Company s board of directors approved, reserved and authorized executive management to issue up to thirty-five percent (35 of any carried interests earned by certain commingled funds and separate account investments to be allocated to certain non-NEO employees of the Company. Sixty percent of the award to each employee vests ratably over four years and the remaining forty percent vest upon the consummation of a liquidity event of the investment whereby the Company actually receives cash carried interests from its partner. The full carried interests earned by the Company will be recorded to income from unconsolidated investments and the amount allocated to employees is recorded as carried interests compensation. Not all of the Company s co-investment structures are included in the Carried Interests Sharing Program either because a structure does not incorporate carried interests that the Company is eligible to receive and/or a structure was an existing structure prior to the Board s approval of the Carried Interests Sharing Program. As of September 30, 2024, (i) of the 85 investments in the Company s co-investment portfolio, 26 of such investments are a part of the Carried Interests Sharing Program; (ii) the Company s total accrued carried interests in its financial statements is 32.2 million, of which 8.1 million was accrued as carried interests compensation expense as part of the Carried Interests Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a reversal of 15.5 million and 5.5 million, respectively related to this program. 
 
 The Company also recently implemented a global employee co-investment program (the Co-Investment Program ). The named executive officers are not participants of the Co-Investment Program. Under the Co-Investment Program, certain employees are provided the opportunity to invest alongside the Company in its investments (in all future investments and certain recently acquired transactions). The amount of funds that the employees, as a group, can invest in the Company s investments is capped at 1.5 of the Company s equity. Participants in the Co-Investment Program will make commitments to the program every year. Generally (with certain exceptions), participants in the Co-Investment Program will invest in every investment made by the Company (investments that such employee has an active role in acquiring and managing) in the applicable year.

The obligations of Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. pursuant to the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. 
 The indentures governing the notes limit Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.'s ability to incur additional indebtedness if, on the date of such incurrence and after giving effect to the new indebtedness, Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.'s maximum balance sheet leverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) is greater than 1.50 to 1.00.

 obligation of KWH and these amounts are presented as a component of our investment debt as it is an unsecured obligation relating to an underlying investment of ours. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. 
 
 In addition, loan agreements that govern the Company's property-level non-recourse financings that are secured by its properties may contain operational and financial covenants, including but not limited to, debt yield related covenants and debt service coverage ratio covenants and, with respect to mortgages secured by certain properties in Europe, loan-to-value ratio covenants. Property-level non-recourse financings with such loan-to-value covenants require that the underlying properties are valued on a periodic basis (at least annually). The failure by the Company to comply with such covenants and/or secure waivers from lenders could result in defaults under these instruments. In addition, if the Company defaults under a mortgage loan and/or such loan is accelerated by the lender, it may automatically be in default under any of its property and corporate unsecured loans that contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions. Please also see Part I. Item 1A "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenant calculations. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have provided guarantees from time to time associated with loans secured by consolidated assets. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) we could be required to make under the guarantees was 161.5 million. The guarantees expire through 2031 and our performance under the guarantees would be required to the extent there is a shortfall upon liquidation between the principal amount of the loan and the net sale proceeds of the applicable properties. If we were to become obligated to perform on these guarantees, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had unfulfilled capital commitments totaling 231.1 million to our joint venture investments and 102.4 million to our loan portfolio. In addition to the unfunded capital commitments on our joint venture investments, we had 17.0 million of equity commitments relating to unconsolidated development projects and 43.6 million related to future ground lease payments that run through 2085 on Kona Village. As we identify investment opportunities in the future, we may be called upon to contribute additional capital to unconsolidated investments in satisfaction of our capital commitment obligations. 
 Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for discussion of our non-recourse carve-out guarantees arrangements, as there have been no material changes to that disclosure.

 (1) The Company s joint ventures in its Co-Investment business segment predominantly acquire and hold and may ultimately dispose of operating properties which are presented by the Company as net gain or loss on disposition under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 because the disposition is not considered an output of the entity s ordinary activities. Certain joint ventures in the same business segment, however, dispose of non-operating properties (such as land and condominiums) from time-to-time, and such sales are an output of the entity s ordinary activities under Topic 606. Accordingly the sale of such real estate is presented by the Company on a gross basis (sale of real estate and cost of real estate sold), and, therefore, the portion of the same that is not attributable to the Company s ownership share is excluded from Co-Investment NOI.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposure relates to: changes in interest rates in connection with our short-term borrowings and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have established an interest rate management policy, which attempts to minimize our overall cost of debt while taking into consideration the earnings implications associated with the volatility of short-term interest rates. As part of this policy, we have elected to maintain a combination of variable and fixed rate debt. As of September 30, 2024, 77 of our consolidated level debt is fixed rate, 21 is floating rate with interest caps and 2 is floating rate without interest caps. As such, fluctuations in 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 interest rates may impact our floating rate debt (and floating rate debt with interest caps to a lesser extent) and cause our consolidated interest expense and income from unconsolidated investments to fluctuate. Typically, these fluctuations do not give rise to a significant long-term interest rate risk because they have generally short maturities. 
 
 We hold variable rate debt on some of our consolidated and unconsolidated properties that are subject to interest rate fluctuations. These variable rates generally are based on the lender s base rate, prime rate, EURIBOR, GBP LIBOR, SOFR, SONIA plus an applicable borrowing margin. Additionally, in order to mitigate some of the risk associated with increasing interest rates we have purchased interest rate caps and swaps. Our interest rate caps and swaps are typically undesignated as they are bought at the corporate level and changes in value are recorded to other income/loss. However we view the fair value movements associated with these interest rate derivatives in conjunction with our interest expense in order to limit the amount of financial statement impact that interest expense can increase with rate increases. However, even though we hold interest rate swaps and caps we are subject to increased interest expense until rates hit the level of caps that have been purchased. If there was a 100-basis point increase or decrease, we would have a 3.4 million increase in interest expense or 7.0 million of interest expense savings during 2024 on our current share of indebtedness. The weighted average strike price on caps and maturity of Kennedy Wilson s variable rate mortgages is 2.87 and approximately 1.2 years, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. 
 The table below represents contractual balances of our consolidated financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair value as of September 30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate for the various assets and liabilities presented are actual as of September 30, 2024. We closely monitor the fluctuation in interest rates, and if rates were to increase significantly, we believe that we would be able to either hedge the change in the interest rate or refinance the loans with fixed interest rate debt. All instruments included in this analysis are non-trading.

 ) Represents principal balance of interest rate receivables, excluding 3.2 million of unamortized discount and 17.3 million of loan loss reserves. 
 Currency Risk - Foreign Currencies 
 A significant portion of our business is located outside the United States. As such, we have foreign currency fluctuation risk with respect to those investments and business units. In certain instances, we utilize foreign currency hedging derivatives to mitigate the impact of this risk on our equity. 
 The financial statements of Kennedy Wilson's subsidiaries located outside the United States are measured using the local currency as this is their functional currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rate. The foreign currencies primarily include the euro and GBP. Cumulative translation adjustments, to the extent not included in cumulative net income, are included in the consolidated statement of equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Currency translation gains and losses and currency derivative gains and losses will remain in other comprehensive income unless and until the Company substantially liquidates the underlying investments. 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 Approximately 33 of our investment account is invested through our foreign platforms in their local currencies. Investment level debt is generally incurred in local currencies and therefore we consider our equity investment as the appropriate exposure to evaluate for hedging purposes. In order to manage the effect of these fluctuations, we generally hedge our book equity exposure to foreign currencies through currency forward contracts and options. As of September 30, 2024, we have hedged 105 of the net asset carrying value of our euro denominated investments and 81 of the net asset carrying value of our GBP denominated investments. 
 Our investment management businesses typically do not require much capital so foreign currency translation and derivative activity primarily relates to the investments segment as that has greater balance sheet exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 We typically have not hedged the impact foreign currency fluctuations may have on our future operations or cash flows. The costs to operate these businesses, such as compensation, overhead and interest expense are incurred in local currencies. As we are not currently hedging our current operations there will be foreign currency impact on our results of operations for both the Consolidated and Co-Investment segments. 
 If there was a 5 increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates on the currencies we invest to the U.S. Dollar our net asset value would increase by 13.2 million or decrease by 14.4 million, respectively. If rates increase or decrease by 10 we would have an increase of 26.0 million and a decrease of 30.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the reporting period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
