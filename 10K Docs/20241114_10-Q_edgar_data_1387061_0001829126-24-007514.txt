 partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, BHO Business Trust II, a Maryland business trust, was the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership and owned the remaining interest in the Operating Partnership. 

All of the Company s current investments are located in the U.S. The Company currently intends to hold its various real properties until such time as its board of directors (the Board of Directors determines that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the Company s investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met. The Company currently has one operating segment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company wholly owned and consolidated eight multifamily real estate properties containing an aggregate of 2,520 apartment units (see Note 5). 

The Company s business is externally managed by LSG Development Advisor LLC (the Advisor ), an affiliate of the Lightstone Group LLC Lightstone ), which provides advisory services to us. Lightstone is majority owned by David Lichtenstein, a member of the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement and subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors, the Advisor is responsible for managing the Company s day-to-day affairs and for services related to the management of its assets. 

The Company has no employees. The Company is dependent on the Advisor and its affiliates for performing a full range of services that are essential to it, including asset management, property management, property management oversight (for those of its properties which are managed by an unrelated third party property manager) and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities; such as tax, accounting, legal, information technology and investor relations services. If the Advisor and its affiliates are unable to provide these services to the Company, it would be required to provide the services itself or obtain the services from other parties. 

See Note 9 for additional information. 

Organization 

In connection with the Company s initial capitalization, the Company issued shares of its common stock Common Shares and shares of its convertible stock to the Company s former advisor on January 19, 2007. The shares of convertible stock were transferred to an affiliate of Lightstone on February 10, 2017 and remain outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million Common Shares outstanding. 

The Company s Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The timing of a liquidity event for the Company s stockholders will depend upon then prevailing market conditions and the Board of Directors assessment of the Company s investment objectives and liquidity options for the Company s stockholders. Although the Board of Directors has currently targeted June 30, 2028 for the commencement of a liquidity event, the Company can provide no assurances as to the actual timing of the commencement of a liquidity event for its stockholders or the ultimate liquidation of the Company. Furthermore, the Company will seek stockholder approval prior to liquidating its entire portfolio. 

million and income tax expense of million, respectively, primarily related to estimated state income taxes. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of and million, respectively, primarily related to estimated state income taxes. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had material uncertain income tax positions. 

million of mezzanine financing collateralized by the ownership interests of the Loan Borrower in a condominium project (the Park House located at 500 West 22nd Street in the West Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. 

During March 2023, the Company and Loan Borrower refinanced the remaining outstanding principal and interest due under the Mezzanine Loan resulting in a new million senior mortgage loan (the Senior Mortgage Loan secured by the Loan Borrower s ownership interest in Park House, consisting of the remaining unsold condominium units and the ground floor retail space. The Senior Mortgage Loan bore interest at a rate of per annum, with a floor of 10.0 and had a term of one-year with one six-month extension option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 

As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Senior Mortgage Loan was million million of principal less million interest reserve). During February 2024, the Loan Borrower made a principal paydown of million with net proceeds from the sale of a condominium unit reducing the outstanding principal balance of the Senior Mortgage Loan to million and the Company simultaneously allowed the Loan Borrower to exercise the six-month extension option extending the maturity date to September 1, 2024. However, in June 2024, the Loan Borrower repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance of million in full with net proceeds from the sale of an additional condominium unit. In connection with the repayment in full of the Senior Mortgage Loan, the Company released the interest reserve of million to the Loan Borrower. 

The fair value of the notes payable is categorized as a Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis valuation on the estimated borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of the notes payable was determined by discounting the future contractual interest and principal payments by a market rate. Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Carrying amounts of the Company s notes payable and the related estimated fair value is summarized as follows:

Corporate and Government Bonds 

() 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recognized an allowance for expected credit losses related to its available-for-sale debt securities as the Company has not identified any unrealized losses for these investments attributable to credit factors. The Company s unrealized losses on investments in corporate and government bonds was primarily caused by an increase in market interest rates. The Company does not currently intend to sell these investments and therefore, it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. 

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the Company s investments in marketable debt securities with stated contractual maturity dates, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities:

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company has entered into interest rate cap contracts with unrelated financial institutions in order to reduce the effect of increases to interest rates associated with certain of its variable rate debt. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments. Management believes the risk of loss due to non-performance is minimal. 

The Company accounts for its interest rate cap contracts as economic hedges marking them to their fair value taking into account present interest rates compared to the contracted fixed rate over the life of the contract. The changes in the fair value of these economic hedges represent unrealized gains or losses which are classified as mark to market adjustment on derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations. 

The fair value of the Company s interest rate cap contracts was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7). 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded unrealized losses of million and million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded unrealized losses of million and million, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses are classified as mark to market adjustment on derivative financial instruments on the Company s consolidated statements of operations and represent the changes in the fair value of these economic hedges during such periods. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company earned million and million, respectively, and during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned million and million, respectively from its interest rate cap contracts. Earnings from interest rate cap contracts are recorded in interest expense, net on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

The standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 

The fair values of the Company s investments in debt securities are measured using quoted prices for these investments; however, the markets for these assets are not active. The fair values of the Company s interest rate cap contracts are measured using other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Company s debt securities and interest rate cap contracts were classified as Level 2 assets and there were no transfers between the level classifications during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Cautionary Note 

The
representations, warranties, and covenants made by us in any agreement filed as an exhibit to this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q are made solely for the benefit of the parties to the agreement, including, in some cases, for the purpose of
allocating risk among the parties to the agreement, and should not be deemed to be representations, warranties, or covenants to or

or reflecting the current state of our affairs. 

Executive Overview 

We were formed primarily to acquire and operate commercial real estate and real estate-related assets on an opportunistic and value-add basis. In particular, we have focused generally on acquiring commercial properties with significant possibilities for capital appreciation, such as those requiring development, redevelopment or repositioning, those located in markets and submarkets with high growth potential, and those available from sellers who were distressed or faced time-sensitive deadlines. In addition, our opportunistic and value-add investment strategy has included investments in real estate-related assets that present opportunities for higher current income. Since our inception, we have acquired a wide variety of commercial properties, including office, industrial, retail, hospitality, multifamily and student housing. We have purchased existing, income-producing properties and newly constructed properties. We have also invested in mortgage and mezzanine loans. We have made our investments in or in respect of real estate assets located in the U.S. and other countries based on our view of existing market conditions. 

All of our current investments are located in the U.S. We currently intend to hold our various real properties until such time as our board of directors (the Board of Directors determines that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met. We currently have one operating segment. As of September 30, 2024, we wholly owned and consolidated eight multifamily real estate properties containing an aggregate 2,520 apartment units. 

Current Environment 

Our operating results are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced by market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility and banking failures, political upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, inflation and recession. 

Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impacts on consumer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, increases in costs due to inflation, higher interest rates, labor and supply chain challenges, and other changes in economic conditions, could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. 

18 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30 , 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 54.5 million, marketable securities, available for sale of 3.8 million and restricted cash of 6.2 million. 

Our principal demands for funds going forward are expected to be for the payment of (a) operating expenses, including capital expenditures, and (b) scheduled debt service on our outstanding indebtedness, including any required replacement interest rate cap contracts. We also may, at our discretion, use funds for (a) tender offers and/or redemptions of our Common Shares, (b) distributions, if any, to our shareholders, and (c) selective acquisitions and/or real estate-related investments. Generally, we expect to meet our cash needs with our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand along with our cash flow from operations, the release of certain funds held in restricted cash and the remaining availability of 4.8 million on one of our non-recourse mortgage loans (the BayVue Apartments Mortgage ). 

However, to the extent that these sources are not sufficient to cover our cash needs, we may use proceeds from additional borrowings and/or selective asset sales to fund such needs. 

As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance and remaining availability under our non-recourse mortgage loan collateralized by the BayVue Apartments (the BayVue Apartments Mortgage was 47.4 million and 4.8 million, respectively. The remaining availability may be drawn for certain capital improvements to the property pursuant to the loan agreement. Although the BayVue Apartments Mortgage is scheduled to mature on July 9, 2025, the Company currently intends to exercise the remaining one-year extension option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to extend the maturity of the BayVue Apartments Mortgage to July 9, 2026. If the Company extends the maturity of the BayVue Apartments Mortgage, it will be required to enter into another interest rate cap contract at substantially similar terms as its interest rate cap contract that matures on July 15, 2025, pursuant to the terms of the BayVue Apartment Mortgage. 

Our non-recourse mortgage loan collateralized by the Parkside Apartments (the Parkside Apartments Mortgage (outstanding principal balance of 16.0 million as of September 30, 2024) is scheduled to mature on June 1, 2025. We currently intend to refinance the Parkside Apartments Mortgage on or before its scheduled maturity date. 

We have borrowed money to acquire properties and make other investments. Under our charter, the maximum amount of our indebtedness is limited to 300 of our net assets as defined by our charter) as of the date of any borrowing; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors. In addition to our charter limitation, our Board of Directors has adopted a policy to generally limit our borrowings to 75 of the value of our assets unless substantial justification exists that borrowing a greater amount is in our best interests. Our policy limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured levels. We regularly monitor the financial stability of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash.

Results of Operations 

We currently have one operating segment. As of September 30, 2024, we wholly owned and consolidated eight multifamily real estate properties. 

Recent Acquisition and Disposition Activities 

Acquisition of the Camellia World Apartments 

On December 19, 2023, we acquired a 210-unit multifamily property located in St. Augustine, Florida (the Camellia World Apartments ), from an unrelated third party, for a contractual purchase price of 53.3 million, plus closing and other acquisition related costs totaling 1.1 million. The acquisition was funded with 33.9 million of proceeds from a mortgage financing (the Camellia World Apartments Mortgage and 20.5 million of funds that had been temporarily placed in escrow with a qualified intermediary in connection with the Company s disposition of a 306-unit multifamily property located in Fishers, Indiana (the Flats at Fishers ). 

Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of the Camellia World Apartments, the Advisor received an aggregate of 1.1 million in acquisition fees, acquisition expense reimbursements and debt financing fees. 

Disposition of the Flats at Fishers 

On November 1, 2023, we completed the disposition of Flats at Fishers for a contractual sales price of 71.0 million. In connection with the disposition of the Flats at Fishers, its non-recourse mortgage loan (the Flats at Fishers Mortgage of 27.7 million was defeased at a cost of 27.1 million and its non-recourse subordinated mortgage loan (the Flats at Fisher Supplemental Mortgage of 8.9 million was repaid in full. Our net proceeds from the disposition of the Flats at Fishers were 33.8 million, after the aforementioned defeasance of the Flats at Fishers Mortgage and the repayment of the Flats at Fisher Supplemental Mortgage, pro rations, and closing and other related transaction costs. In connection with the disposition of Flats at Fishers, we recognized a gain on sale of investment property of 41.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. 

The disposition of the Flats at Fishers did not qualify to be reported as discontinued operations since it did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, the operating results of the Flats at Fishers are reflected in our results from continuing operations for all periods presented through its date of disposition. 

The net proceeds from the disposition of the Flats of Fishers of 33.8 million were placed in an escrow with a qualified intermediary to potentially facilitate a Section 1031 exchange transaction pursuant to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and as described above, 20.8 million of these funds were used in connection with our acquisition of the Camellia World Apartments on December 19, 2023. An additional 0.1 million of these funds were used for other acquisition related costs in the first quarter of 2024. The remaining funds of 13.2 million were released to us on May 2, 2024. 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 reflect our acquisition and disposition activities during such periods. Properties which were owned by us during the entire periods presented are referred to as our Same Store properties.

increase of 1.2 million, compared to 10.3 million for the same period in 2023. Excluding the
effect of our recent acquisition and disposition activities discussed above, our depreciation and amortization expenses increased by
 0.3 million for our Same Store properties during the 2024 period. 

Interest
Expense, Net Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.4 million, an increase of 0.2 million,
compared to 11.2 million for the same period in 2023. Interest expense is primarily attributable to financings associated with our
multifamily real estate properties and reflects both changes in market interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and the
weighted average principal outstanding during each of the periods. Excluding the effect of our recent acquisition and disposition
activities discussed above, interest expense, net for our Same Store properties decreased by 0.4 million during the 2024 period.
Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we earned 2.3 million and 2.1 million, respectively, from
our interest rate cap contracts which is recorded in interest expense, net. 

Mark to Market Adjustment on Derivative Financial Instruments During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we recorded negative mark to market adjustment of 2.5 million and 1.7 million, respectively. These mark to market adjustments represented the change in the fair value of our interest rate cap contracts during the applicable period. 

Related Party Transactions 

Our business is externally managed by LSG Development Advisor LLC (the Advisor ), an affiliate of the Lightstone Group LLC Lightstone which provides advisory services to us and we have no employees. Lightstone is majority owned by David Lichtenstein, a member of the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement and subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors, the Advisor is responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and for services related to the management of our assets. 

We have agreements with the Advisor and its affiliates to pay certain fees and reimburse certain expenses in connection with services performed and costs incurred by these entities and other related parties. We are dependent on the Advisor and its affiliates for performing a full range of services that are essential to us, including asset management, property management, property management oversight (for those properties which are managed by an unrelated third party property manager) and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities; such as tax, accounting, legal, information technology and investor relations services. If the Advisor and its affiliates are unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide the services ourselves or obtain the services from other parties.

Summary of Cash Flows 

Operating activities 

The cash provided by operating activities of 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of our net loss of 8.8 million plus the net negative change in operating assets and liabilities of 1.3 million adjusted to add back the negative mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments of 2.5 million, depreciation and amortization of 11.5 million and amortization of deferred financing costs of 1.0 million. 

Investing activities 

The cash provided by investing activities of 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of payments received on our note receivable of 4.9 million partially offset by capital expenditures of 3.1 million. 

Financing activities 

The cash used in financing activities of 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of principal payments on notes payable of 6.3 million, payments of loan fees and expenses of 0.4 million and redemptions and cancellation of common stock of 6.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from notes payable of 0.2 million. 

Debt Financings 

From time to time, we have obtained mortgage, bridge, or mezzanine loans for acquisitions and investments, as well as property development, redevelopment and renovations. In the future, we may obtain new financings for such activities or to refinance our existing real estate assets, depending on multiple factors. 

Our notes payable balance was 281.5 million, net of deferred financing fees of 2.2 million, and had a weighted average interest rate of 5.76 as of September 30, 2024. Our notes payable balance was 287.0 million, net of deferred financing fees of 2.8 million, and had a weighted average interest rate of 5.02 as of December 31, 2023. 

25 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

We have entered into interest rate cap contracts with unrelated financial institutions in order to reduce the effect of increases to interest rates associated with certain of our variable rate debt. We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments. Management believes the risk of loss due to non-performance is minimal. 

We account for our interest rate cap contracts as economic hedges marking them to their fair market value taking into account present interest rates compared to the contracted fixed rate over the life of the contract. The changes in the fair value of these economic hedges represent unrealized gains or losses on the interest rate cap contracts which are classified as mark to market adjustment on derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Pursuant to the terms of our BayVue Apartments Mortgage and our Citadel Apartments Mortgages, we are required to enter into one or more interest rate cap contracts which cap SOFR at prescribed amounts for as long as these mortgages remain outstanding. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had two interest rate cap contracts. The first interest rate cap contract, which was entered into at a cost of 1.1 million on July 8, 2024 with an effective date of July 15, 2024, had a notional amount of 52.2 million, matures on July 15, 2025 and effectively caps SOFR at 2.50 during its term. The second interest rate cap contract, which was entered into at a cost of 0.8 million on March 13, 2024 with an effective date of April 11, 2024, had a notional amount of 49.0 million, matured on October 11, 2024 and effectively capped SOFR at 2.00 during its term. 

Additionally, on October 10, 2024, we entered into another interest rate cap contract with an effective date of October 11, 2024, with an unrelated financial institution at a cost of 0.5 million. This interest rate cap contract has a notional amount of 44.0 million, matures on October 11, 2025 and effectively caps SOFR at 3.00 during its term.

 These amounts represent future interest payments related to notes payable obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreement. All variable rate debt agreements are based on the one-month SOFR rate. For purposes of calculating future interest amounts on variable interest rate debt the one-month SOFR rate as of September 30 , 2024 was used. 

As of September 30 , 2024, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. 

26 

Amended SRP 

On November 10, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted a Seventh Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the Amended SRP ), which became effective on January 1, 2023. Under the terms of the Amended SRP, any stockholder may request redemption of their Common Shares, subject to the significant conditions and limitations of the program. Additionally, under the terms of the Amended SRP, we will redeem Common Shares at 85 of our most recently published net asset value NAV per Common Shares NAV per Share in effect as of the date the request for redemption is approved. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Amended SRP, any Common Shares approved for redemption are redeemed on a periodic basis as determined by the Board of Directors, generally expected to be shortly after the end of each calendar quarterly period. However, we will not redeem, during any calendar year, more than 5 of the number of Common Shares outstanding on last day of the previous calendar year (the 5 Limitation ). The cash available for redemption of Common Shares will be set by the Board of Directors not less often than annually (the Funding Limitation and, together with the 5 Limitation, the Redemption Limitations ). The Board of Directors has set the amount of cash available for redemption of shares for both of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 at 8.0 million, which is generally to be allocated 2.0 million for each calendar quarterly period. We may change the amount of the Redemption Limitations upon 10 business days notice to its stockholders and will provide notice of any change to the Redemption Limitations by including such information in (a) a Current Report on Form 8-K or in our annual or quarterly reports, all publicly filed with the SEC or (b) a separate mailing to our stockholders. 

Redemption requests will be honored pro rata among all requests received subject to the Redemption Limitations and will not be honored on a first come, first served basis. 

The Board of Directors reserves the right in its sole discretion at any time and from time to time, subject to any notice requirements described in our Amended SRP, to (1) reject any request for redemption of Common Shares, (2) change the purchase price for redemption of Common Shares, (3) limit the funds to be used for redemption of Common Shares under the Amended SRP or otherwise change the Redemption Limitations, or (4) amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the Amended SRP. 

For the nine months ended September 30 , 2024, we repurchased 456,621 Common Shares, pursuant to our Amended SRP at a weighted average price of 13.14. For the nine months ended September 30 , 2023, we repurchased 329,140 Common S hares, pursuant to its Amended SRP at a weighted average price of 12.61 . 

Distributions 

We made an election to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2008. U.S. federal tax law requires a REIT to distribute at least 90 of its annual REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to continue to qualify for REIT status, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available. Distributions, if any, are authorized at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on their analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods. Such analyses may include actual and anticipated operating cash flow, capital expenditure needs, general financial and market conditions, proceeds from asset sales and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our Board of Directors decisions will be substantially influenced by the intention to maintain our federal tax status as a REIT. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will pay distributions at any particular level, or at all. 

We did not make any distributions to our stockholders during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

27 

On September 27, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a special cash distribution of 0.42 per Common Share payable to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2024 (the 2024 Special Distribution ). The 2024 Special Distribution totaled 8.0 million, which represented of a portion of the net proceeds generated from asset sales, and was paid on or about October 15, 2024. 

On September 20, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a special cash distribution of 0.11 per Common Share payable to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2023 (the 2023 Special Distribution ). The 2023 Special Distribution totaled 2.2 million, which represented of a portion of the net proceeds generated from asset sales, and was paid on or about October 16, 2023. 

Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 

The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. 

Because of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations FFO ), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT s operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). 

We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the White Paper ). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s definition. 

We believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management and reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 

Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings. 

Because of these factors, the Investment Program Association (the IPA ), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations MFFO ), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds and are no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisition fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 

28 

We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the Practice Guideline issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition and transaction-related fees and expenses (which includes costs incurred in connection with strategic alternatives), amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of market lease and other intangibles, net (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments and borrowings, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (including gains or losses incurred on assets held for sale), gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. 

We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. 

Not all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. FFO and MFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 

Neither the SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to the White Paper or the Practice Guidelines or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry, and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.

1) 
 Management believes that adjusting for mark-to-market adjustments is appropriate because they are nonrecurring items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations and reflects unrealized impacts on value based only on then current market conditions, although they may be based upon current operational issues related to an individual property or industry or general market conditions. Mark-to-market adjustments are made for items such as ineffective derivative instruments, certain marketable equity securities and any other items that GAAP requires we make a mark-to-market adjustment for. The need to reflect mark-to-market adjustments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly and/or annual basis in accordance with GAAP. 

2) 
 Management believes that adjusting for gains or losses related to extinguishment/sale of debt, derivatives or securities holdings is appropriate because they are items that may not be reflective of ongoing operations. By excluding these items, management believes that MFFO provides supplemental information related to sustainable operations that will be more comparable between other reporting periods.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including impairment of investment property and depreciation and
amortization. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from the discussion found in the Management Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 which was filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) using the criteria established in Internal Control-New Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in this report is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II 

OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings. 

From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we may become subject to legal proceedings, claims or disputes. 

As of the date hereof, we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings of which the outcome is probable or reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition, which would require accrual or disclosure of the contingency and possible range of loss. Additionally, we have not recorded any loss contingencies related to legal proceedings in which the potential loss is deemed to be remote. 

Item 2. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

During the period covered by this quarterly report, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 

Our Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The timing of a liquidity event for our stockholders will depend upon then prevailing market conditions and our Board of Directors assessment of our investment objectives and liquidity options for our stockholders. Currently, our Board of Directors has targeted June 30, 2028 for the commencement of a liquidity event. However, we can provide no assurances as to the actual timing of the commencement of a liquidity event for our stockholders or our ultimate liquidation. Furthermore, we will seek stockholder approval prior to liquidating our entire portfolio.
