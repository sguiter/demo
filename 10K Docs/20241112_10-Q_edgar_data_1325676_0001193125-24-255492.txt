In the event of default by the Partnership, MS Co., the Partnership s commodity futures broker and the sole counterparty to the Partnership s non-exchange-traded
 contracts, as applicable, has the right to offset the Partnership s obligation with the Partnership s cash and/or U.S. Treasury bills held by MS Co., thereby minimizing MS Co. s risk of loss. In certain instances, MS Co. may not post collateral and as such, in the event of default by MS Co., the Partnership is exposed to the amount shown in the Statements of Financial Condition. In the case of exchange-traded contracts, the Partnership s exposure to counterparty risk may be reduced since the exchange s clearinghouse interposes its credit between buyer and seller and the clearinghouse s guarantee funds may be available in the event of a default. In some instances, the actual collateral received and/or pledged may be more than the amount shown due to overcollateralization.

It is the Partnership s intention to continue to invest in the Funds. The performance of the Partnership is directly affected by the performance of the Funds. Expenses to investors as a result of the investment in the Funds are approximately the same as they would be if the Partnership traded directly and redemption rights are not affected.

Options.

 The Partnership and the Funds may purchase and write (sell) both exchange-listed and OTC options on commodities or financial instruments. An option is a contract allowing, but not requiring, its holder to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific or standard commodity or financial instrument at a specified price during a specified time period. The option premium is the total price paid or received for the option contract. When the Partnership/Funds write an option, the premium received is recorded as a liability in the Partnership s/Funds Statements of Financial Condition and marked-to-market

 daily. When the Partnership/Funds purchase an option, the premium paid is recorded as an asset in the Partnership s/Funds Statements of Financial Condition and marked-to-market

 daily. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on option contracts are included in the Partnership s/Funds Statements of Income and Expenses. 
 As both a buyer and seller of options, the Partnership/Funds pay or receive a premium at the outset and then bear the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Partnership/Funds to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk of loss is limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permit cash settlement and do not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Partnership/Funds do not consider these contracts to be guarantees. 
 Futures-Style Options

. The Partnership and the Funds may trade futures-style option contracts. Unlike traditional option contracts, the premiums for futures-style option contracts are not received or paid upon the onset of the trade. The premiums are recognized and received or paid as part of the sales price when the contract is closed. Similar to a futures contract, variation margin for the futures-style option contract may be made or received by the Partnership/Funds each business day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying contracts, and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by the Partnership/Funds. Transactions in futures-style option contracts require participants to make both initial margin deposits of cash or other assets and variation margin deposits, through the futures broker, directly with the exchange on which the contracts are traded. Futures-style option contracts are presented as part of Net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts or Net unrealized depreciation on open futures contracts, as applicable, in the Partnership s/Funds Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) on futures-style option contracts are included in the Partnership s/Funds Statements of Income and Expenses. 
 Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Partnership/Funds due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded. The Partnership and the Funds are exposed to market risk equal to the value of the futures and forward contracts held and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. 
 Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. The Partnership s/Funds risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership s/Funds risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership/Funds to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Funds have credit risk and concentration risk, as MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate are counterparties or brokers with respect to the Partnership s/Funds assets. Credit risk with respect to exchange-traded
 instruments is reduced to the extent that, through MS Co. or an MS Co. affiliate, the Partnership s/Funds counterparty is an exchange or clearing organization. 
 The General Partner/Trading Manager monitors and attempts to mitigate the Partnership s/Funds risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems and, accordingly, believes that it has effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership/Funds may be subject. These monitoring systems generally allow the General Partner/Trading Manager to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted
 performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provide account analysis of futures, forward and option contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions. 
 The majority of these financial instruments mature within of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the Partnership s/Funds business, these instruments may not be held to maturity. 

The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership s net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law. 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Partnership/Funds enter into contracts and agreements that contain various representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. The Partnership s/Funds maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be determined, as this could include future claims that have not yet been made against the Partnership/Funds. The General Partner/Trading Manager considers the risk of any future obligation relating to these indemnifications to be remote. 
 Beginning in February 2022, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and a number of other nations imposed sanctions against Russia in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, and these and other governments around the world may impose additional sanctions in the future as the conflict develops. In addition, on October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. Shortly following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas. These conflicts and subsequent sanctions have created volatility in the price of various commodities and may lead to a deterioration in the political and trade relationships that exist between the countries involved and have a negative impact on business activity globally, and therefore could affect the performance of the Partnership s investments. Furthermore, uncertainties regarding these conflicts and the varying involvement of the United States and other countries preclude prediction as to the ultimate impact on global economic and market conditions, and, as a result, presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Partnership and the performance of its investments or operations, and the ability of the Partnership to achieve its investment objectives. Additionally, to the extent that investors, service providers and/or other third parties have material operations or assets in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine or Israel, they may have their operations disrupted and/or suffer adverse consequences related to the ongoing conflicts.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Liquidity and Capital Resources The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its assets are its (i) investment in the Funds, (ii) redemptions receivable from the Funds, (iii) equity in trading account, consisting of unrestricted cash, restricted cash, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and options purchased at fair value, if applicable, and (iv) interest receivable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership, through its direct investments and investment in the Funds. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred in the third quarter of 2024. The Partnership s/Funds investment in futures, forwards and options may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits. Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership/Funds from promptly liquidating their futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions. Other than the risks inherent in commodity futures, forwards, options and swaps trading, and U.S. Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities, the General Partner/Trading Manager knows of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties which will result in or which are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership s/Funds liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. The Partnership s capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners, as increased or decreased by realized and/or unrealized gains and losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, subscriptions and redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any. The Partnership s primary need for capital resources is for Futures Interests trading. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Partnership capital decreased 6.2 from 144,572,899 to 135,645,183. This decrease was attributable to redemptions of 3,203.6100 Class A limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 8,809,048, redemptions of 14.8820 Class Z limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 33,639, redemptions of 33.0400 Class Z general partner Redeemable Units totaling 75,097 and net loss of 3,502,432 which was partially offset by subscriptions of 1,223.8260 Class A limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 3,367,500 and subscriptions of 54.1850 Class Z limited partner Redeemable Units totaling 125,000. Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for direct investments and investment in the Funds in subsequent periods. Other than as discussed above, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership s capital resource arrangements at the present time. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. The General Partner believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. As a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. A summary of the Partnership s significant accounting policies is described in Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Financial Statements. The Partnership/Funds record all investments at fair value in their respective financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized gains (losses) in the respective Statements of Income and Expenses.

Results of Operations During the Partnership s third quarter of 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 2.9 from 2,739.56 to 2,660.96 as compared to an increase of 4.5 in the third quarter of 2023. During the Partnership s third quarter of 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class D decreased 2.9 from 2,172.39 to 2,110.06 as compared to an increase of 4.5 in the third quarter of 2023. During the Partnership s third quarter of 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 2.7 from 2,272.91 to 2,211.88 as compared to an increase of 4.7 in the third quarter of 2023. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses during the third quarter of 2024 of 4,356,034. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy, grains, livestock, and softs and were partially offset by gains in metals. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses during the third quarter of 2023 of 6,532,374. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy, grains and softs and were partially offset by losses in livestock and metals. During the third quarter, Partnership s most significant losses were incurred within the energy sector throughout the quarter from long positions in crude oil futures as prices steadily declined amid high global inventories and concerns a potential slowdown in the global economy could curtail energy demand. Within the soft commodities markets, losses were recorded during August and September from short positions in coffee futures as prices rallied as drought conditions in key growing regions in Vietnam and South America threatened crops. Additional losses were incurred during July from currency hedging positions in the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar. Within the grains, losses were experienced during September from short positions in soybean and corn futures as grain prices surged higher amid increased global commodity purchasing. Elsewhere, short positions in live cattle futures recorded losses during September as prices advanced on increased buying demand. A portion of the Partnership s losses for the third quarter was offset by gains achieved within the metals sector during September from long positions in gold futures as a falling U.S. dollar and an outlook for further interest rate cuts boosted demand for precious metals. Additional gains in the metals were experienced during September from long positions in copper and aluminum futures as industrial metals prices rose after China announced economic stimulus measures. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class A decreased 2.6 from 2,730.63 to 2,660.96 as compared to an increase of 3.1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class D decreased 2.6 from 2,165.30 to 2,110.06 as compared to an increase of 3.1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the Partnership s nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit for Class Z decreased 2.0 from 2,256.96 to 2,211.88 as compared to an increase of 3.7 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 4,084,238. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in currencies, energy, livestock, metals and softs and were partially offset by gains in grains. The Partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 4,669,920. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership s/Funds trading of commodity futures in energy, grains, livestock and softs and were partially offset by losses in currencies and metals. During the first nine months of the year, the most notable trading losses were incurred within the soft commodities sector during March and April from short positions in coffee and cocoa futures as prices rallied as adverse weather conditions in key growing regions threatened crop supplies, pushing prices sharply higher. Additional losses in the soft commodities sector were experienced during January, August, and September from short positions in coffee, as well as during January from short positions in sugar futures. In the energies, losses were incurred within the energy sector throughout the third quarter from long positions in crude oil futures as prices steadily declined amid high global inventories and concerns a potential slowdown in the global economy could curtail energy demand. Further losses in the energies were recorded from positions in European carbon emission allowances futures as prices moved without consistent direction for the majority of the first nine months of the year. Losses in the currencies were experienced during July from currency hedging positions in the Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar. In the metals, losses were incurred from March through June from long positions in iron ore futures as prices weakened on reduced Chinese demand. Losses in the metals were also recorded during June from long positions in copper futures as prices reversed lower following a prolonged bullish trend as reports of tepid economic growth in China could potentially curtail Chinese copper demand. A portion of the Partnership s losses for the first nine months of the year was offset by gains achieved within the grains sector during January and February from short positions in soybean and corn futures as prices fell to near three-year lows amid reports of growing grain production in the U.S. and South America. Further gains in the sector were recorded from short positions in soybean and wheat futures as prices also fell during June, July, and August on expectations for strong crops during harvest season. Trading results within the livestock markets were relatively flat during the first nine months of the year. 
 22 

Commodity markets are highly volatile. Broad price fluctuations and rapid inflation increase not only the risks involved in commodity trading, but also the possibility of profit. The profitability of the Partnership/Funds depends on the existence of major price trends and the ability of the Advisors to correctly identify those price trends. Price trends are influenced by, among other factors, changing supply and demand relationships, weather, pandemics, epidemics and other health crises, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. To the extent that market trends exist and the Advisors are able to identify them, the Partnership/Funds expect to increase capital through operations. Interest income on 100 of the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership s (or the Partnership s allocable portion of the Funds brokerage account during each month is earned at a rate equal to the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership/Funds will not receive interest on amounts in the futures brokerage account that are committed to margin. Any interest earned on the Partnership s and/or the Funds account in excess of the amounts described above, if any, will be retained by MS Co. and/or shared with the General Partner. All interest income earned on U.S. Treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities will be retained by the Partnership and/or the Funds, as applicable. Interest income earned for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 165,360 and increased by 176,309, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends on (1) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership s and/or the applicable Funds accounts, (2) the amount of U.S. Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and/or the Funds and (3) interest rates over which none of the Partnership, the Funds or MS Co. has control. Certain clearing fees are based on the number of trades executed by the Advisors for the Partnership/Funds. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the number of trades executed during the period. Clearing fees related to direct investments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 107,544 and 165,086, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in these clearing fees was primarily due to an increase in the number of direct trades made by the Partnership during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted Net Assets of Class A Redeemable Units and Class D Redeemable Units as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 23,332 and 47,853, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease was due to lower average adjusted net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted Net Assets as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 49,630 and 90,097, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The decrease was due to lower average net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. General Partner fees are paid to the General Partner for administering the business and affairs of the Partnership including, among other things, (i) selecting, appointing and terminating the Partnership s commodity trading advisors, (ii) allocating and reallocating the Partnership s assets among the commodity trading advisors and (iii) monitoring the activities of the commodity trading advisors. These fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership s adjusted net assets as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance, subscriptions and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. General Partner fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 23,227 and 52,284, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. This decrease was due to lower average net assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Incentive fees are based on the Net Trading Profits (as defined in the respective management agreements between the Partnership, the General Partner and each Advisor) generated by each Advisor at the end of each quarter, half year or year, as applicable. Trading performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted a reversal of incentive fees of 88,508 and incentive fees of 372,049, respectively. Trading performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in incentive fees of 242,826 and 927,773, respectively. To the extent an Advisor incurs a loss for the Partnership, the Advisor will not be paid incentive fees until such Advisor recovers any net loss incurred and earns additional new trading profits for the Partnership. 
 23 

In allocating substantially all of the assets of the Partnership among the Advisors, the General Partner considers, among other factors, the Advisors past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the Advisors and allocate assets to additional advisors at any time. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Partnership s assets were allocated among the Advisors in the following approximate percentages:

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . The Partnership/Funds are speculative commodity pools. The market sensitive instruments held by the Partnership/Funds are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or substantially all of the Partnership s/Funds assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Partnership s/Funds main line of business. The limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment. Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Partnership s/Funds open positions and, consequently, in their earnings and cash balances. The Partnership s/Funds market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Partnership s/Funds open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which they trade. The Partnership/Funds rapidly acquire and liquidate both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Partnership s/Funds past performance is not necessarily indicative of their future results. Quantifying the Partnership s and the Funds Trading Value at Risk The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Partnership s/Funds market risk exposures contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact. The Partnership/Funds account for open positions on the basis of fair value accounting principles. Any loss in the market value of the Partnership s/Funds open positions is directly reflected in the Partnership s/Funds earnings and cash flow. The Partnership s/Funds risk exposure in the market sectors traded by the Advisors is estimated below in terms of Value at Risk. Please note that the Value at Risk model is used to numerically quantify market risk for historic reporting purposes only and is not utilized by either the General Partner or the Advisors in their daily risk management activities. Value at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Partnership/Funds could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Partnership s/Funds speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Partnership/Funds of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Partnership s/Funds experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin ). In light of the foregoing, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Partnership s/Funds losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Partnership s/Funds attempts to manage their market risk. Exchange margin requirements have been used by the Partnership/Funds as the measure of their Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95 -99 of any one-day interval. The margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation. Value at Risk tables represent a probabilistic assessment of the risk of loss in market sensitive instruments. Northlander and Drakewood trade the Partnership s assets indirectly in master fund managed accounts established in the name of the master funds over which they have or had been granted limited authority to make trading decisions. Millburn, Ospraie, EMC and Opus directly trade managed accounts in the name of the Partnership. The first two trading Value at Risk tables reflect the market sensitive instruments held by the Partnership directly and through its investments in the Funds. The remaining trading Value at Risk tables reflect the market sensitive instruments held by the Partnership directly (i.e in the managed accounts in the Partnership s name traded by certain Advisors) and indirectly by each Fund separately. There have been no material changes in the trading Value at Risk information previously disclosed in the Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were subscriptions of 779.2520 Class A Redeemable Units totaling 2,132,500. Redeemable Units are issued in reliance upon applicable exemptions from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Section 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The Redeemable Units are purchased by accredited investors, as described in Regulation D. In determining the applicability of the exemption, the General Partner relies on the fact that the Redeemable Units are purchased by accredited investors in a private offering. 

Proceeds from the sale of Redeemable Units are used in the trading of commodity interests including futures, option and forward contracts and any other interests pertaining thereto, including interest in commodity pools. 

The following chart sets forth the purchases of limited partner Redeemable Units for each Class by the Partnership.
