and for the three months and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contract liabilities are reduced as the Company transfers product to the customer under the renewal option approach. Revenue recognized in the chemical segment from the contract liability reductions was and for the three months and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. These contract asset and liability balances are reported on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

 At September 30, 2024 , approximately of revenue is expected to be recognized from the remaining performance obligations. FutureFuel expects to recognize this revenue ratably over the expected sales over the expected term of its long-term contracts ranging from two to six years. Approximately of this revenue is expected to be recognized over the next months, and is expected to be recognized over the subsequent months. These amounts are subject to change based upon changes in the estimated contract life and estimated quantities to be sold over the contract life. 
 
 The Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606 - 10 - 50 - 14 and excludes the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less; and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.

for letters of credit and for swingline loans (collectively, the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility expires on March 30, 2025. 
 
 On March 1, 2023 , the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the First Amendment ). The First Amendment primarily amends the Credit Agreement to transition the Credit Facility from the London Interbank Offered Rate to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and other conforming changes, in each case as more specifically set forth in the First Amendment. The First Amendment does not modify the aggregate amount, or expiration date, of the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the interest rate floats at the following margins over SOFR, or base rate based upon our leverage ratio. 

1.00:1.0 And 
 1.50:1.0 And 
 2.00:1.0 And 
 2.50:1.0 

The terms of the Credit Facility contain certain negative covenants and conditions including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated minimum interest coverage ratio. 
 
 There were borrowings under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . 

Effective tax rate 

The Company s income tax benefit was insignificant in the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision was comprised primarily of an increase in the valuation allowance against net deferred assets, plus immaterial state taxes and miscellaneous items. No deferred tax benefits on ongoing tax losses or other deferred tax assets have been recognized, reflecting management s determination that none of the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. The three - and nine -month periods in 2023 reflected immaterial state taxes and miscellaneous items. 
 
 The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly and records a valuation allowance to reduce these assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of FutureFuel Corp. FutureFuel , the Company , we , or our should be read together with our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, set forth herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Information below for additional discussion regarding risks associated with forward-looking statements. 
 Unless otherwise stated, all dollar amounts are in thousands. 
 Overview 
 
 Our Company is managed and reported in two reporting segments: chemicals and biofuels. Within the chemical segment are two product groupings: custom chemicals and performance chemicals. The custom product group is composed of specialty chemicals manufactured for a single customer whereas the performance product group is composed of chemicals manufactured for multiple customers. The biofuel segment is composed of one product group. Management believes that the diversity of each segment strengthens the company in the ability to utilize resources and is committed to growing each segment. 
 
 Within the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA Renewable Fuel Standard RFS ), we generate 1.5 Renewable Identification Numbers RINs for each gallon of biodiesel sold in the United States with a classification of a D4 or D6 RIN. RINs are used to monitor the level of renewable fuel traded in a given year in accordance with RFS 2 within the EPA moderated transaction system. We do not assign cost of goods sold to the generation of RINs as the physical fuel generates the full cost. As of September 30, 2024, we held 5.0 million D4 and D6 RINs with a fair market value of 2,556. Comparatively, as of September 30, 2023, FutureFuel held 4.2 million RINs with a fair market value of 6,971, and at December 31, 2023, 4.3 million RINs were held with a fair market value of 6,567.

(28) 

We use adjusted EBITDA as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities (each as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses, excluding, when applicable, non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, public offering expenses, acquisition-related transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments, losses on disposal of property and equipment, non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments, and other non-operating income or expenses. Information relating to adjusted EBITDA is provided so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of our business. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies; therefore, the results of our calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA allows our chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of our business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of our operating segments to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, to fund capital expenditures, and to pay dividends. In particular, our management believes that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance and liquidity, relative to performance and liquidity based on GAAP results. This measure isolates the effects of certain items, including depreciation and amortization (which may vary among our operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance), non-cash stock-based compensation expense (which is a non-cash expense that varies widely among similar companies), and non-cash gains and losses on derivative instruments (which can cause net income to appear volatile from period to period relative to the sale of the underlying physical product). 

16

We utilize commodity derivative instruments primarily to attempt to mitigate the effect of commodity price volatility and to provide greater certainty of cash flows associated with sales of our commodities. We utilize mark-to-market accounting to account for these instruments. Thus, our results in any given period can be impacted, sometimes significantly, by changes in market prices relative to our contract price along with the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel. We include the mark-to-market or non-cash portion of this item as an adjustment to adjusted EBITDA as we believe it provides a relevant indicator of the underlying performance of our business in a given period. 
 
 Additionally, we held marketable securities of certain debt securities (trust preferred stock) and in preferred stock and other equity instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, but sold all marketable security investments during the three months ended June 30, 2023. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on these marketable securities fluctuated from period to period. We included this item as an adjustment to adjusted EBITDA in the prior year period as we believed it provided a relevant indicator of the underlying performance of our business. 
 
 The following table reconciles net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance financial measure, with adjusted EBITDA.

Consolidated revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 65,612 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decline was driven mostly by lower sales volumes in the biofuel segment of 41,015. Production issues, primarily stemming from delays by equipment suppliers that created an extended service utility downtime, which prevented us from building the biodiesel inventories we would typically have available to sell in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Also reducing sales revenue in the three-month period, were lower prices in the biofuel segment of 24,678 due to a decline in renewable fuel and RIN prices with market supply in excess of the EPA RIN mandate. In our chemical segment, sales revenue increased 81 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior-year period, due primarily to stronger sales volumes in the coatings market of 1,457, but was mostly offset by reduced chemical sales prices, 1,376, from chemicals sold into the agricultural and energy markets. 
 
 Consolidated revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 94,411 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As noted above, this decline was driven mostly by lower sales volumes in the biofuel segment of 48,590 as production issues in the first three months of the year related to harsh winter weather and the production issues noted above in the three months ended September 30, 2024, prevented us from building the biodiesel inventories we would typically have available to sell during the current period. Also reducing sales revenue in the nine-month period, were lower prices in the biofuel segment of 42,560 due to a decline in renewable fuel and RIN prices with market supply in excess of the EPA RIN mandate. In our chemical segment, sales revenue declined a net 3,261 5,382 on reduced prices on chemicals sold into the agricultural and energy markets partially offset by increased volumes in the energy market, 2,121), compared to the prior-year period. 
 
 Gross profit in the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 3,487 as compared to the same period of 2023, due primarily to: (i) lower sales prices in the chemical agricultural and energy markets and (ii) reduced throughput of biofuel segment volumes primarily due to the issues noted above. 
 
 Gross profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 2,854 as compared to the same period of 2023, primarily due to: (i) a reduction of RIN sales in the current nine-month period and (ii) the change in the adjustment in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the Last In First Out LIFO method of inventory accounting. This adjustment increased gross profit 2,885 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an increase of 6,023 in the same period of 2023. Gross profit was negatively impacted by the change in the activity of derivative instruments with a realized loss of 354 and unrealized loss of 1,696 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a realized gain of 9,437 and unrealized gain of 3,259 in the same period of 2023. Gross profit was also negatively impacted in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, by higher costs resulting from the impact of extreme winter weather and the production issues noted above. 
 
 Operating e xpenses 
 
 Operating expenses decreased 302 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was from lower administrative and research and development expenses. Operating expenses decreased 650 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease also resulted from lower research and development and administrative expenses. 
 
 Other income, net 
 
 Other income decreased a net 801 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023 from lower interest income of 1,830 compared to 2,527 in the prior period. Other income increased a net 1,513 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from the receipt of a legal settlement of 2,750 . Partially offsetting this increase was lower interest income of 6,151 compared to dividend and interest income of 6,595 and a gain of 575 on marketable securities in the same period of 2023 . 

18

Income tax (benefit) provision 
 
 The Company s income tax benefit was insignificant in the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision was comprised primarily of an increase in the valuation allowance against net deferred assets, plus immaterial state taxes and miscellaneous items. No deferred tax benefits on ongoing tax losses or other deferred tax assets have been recognized, reflecting management s determination that none of the net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. The three-month period in 2023 similarly reflected immaterial state taxes and miscellaneous items. 
 
 The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly and records a valuation allowance to reduce these assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Chemical revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 0.5 or 81 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from custom chemicals for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 15,323, a net increase of 869 from the same period in 2023, resulting from higher sales volumes of 1,791 from products sold in the agricultural and energy markets, which were partially offset by lower prices of 1,204. Performance chemicals revenue was 2,605, a decrease of 788 from the three months ended September 30, 2023 . This decrease was mostly from lower sales volumes of glycerin due to reduced production resulting from the extended service utility downtime caused by equipment suppliers. 
 
 Chemical revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 5.6 or 3,261 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from custom chemicals for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 46,333, a decrease of 317 from the same period in 2023. The sales revenue decline was from reduced sales prices of chemicals sold in the agricultural and energy markets. Partially offsetting these reductions were sales from increased volumes of chemicals sold into the automotive coatings market as well as sales of one new product into the coatings market. Performa nce chemicals revenue was 8,890, a decrease of 2,944 from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mostly from lower sales volumes and price of glycerin from reduced production. 
 
 Gross profit for the chemical segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 3,471 and 9,812 when compared to the same periods of 2023. This decrease was primarily from: (i) reduced chemical sales prices in the agricultural and energy markets, (ii) reduced throughput as described above, and (iii) the change in the adjustment in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the LIFO method of inventory accounting. This adjustment decreased gross profit 418 in the current three-month period as compared to an increase in gross profit of 234 in the same period of the prior year. For the nine months, this adjustment increased gross profit 623 in the current period as compared to 1,105 in the same period of the prior year.

Biofuels revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 65,693 as compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease resulted fro m a 42 or 41,015 reduction in sales volume and a 25 or 24,678 reduction in the average price of fuel sold. The lower prices were driven in part by the reduction in D4 RIN prices as a result of the excess of D4 RINs of the EPA's mandated volumes. The volume reduction resulted from production issues, primarily stemming from delays by equipment suppliers that created an extended service utility downtime, which prevented us from building the biodiesel inventories we would typically have available to sell in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Biofuels revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 91,150 as compared to the same period of 2023 . The decrease was primarily from a 22 or 48,590 reduction in sales volume and a 20 or 42,560 reduction in the average price of fuel sold. Additionally, production and sales volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were impacted by the extreme winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 A significant portion of our biodiesel sold was t o two and three majo r refiners/blenders in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to four and two in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. No assurances can be given that we will continue to sell to such major refiners, or, if we do sell, the volume we will sell or the profit margin we will realize. We do not believe that the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our biofuels segment or on us as a whole because: (i) we believe that we could readily sell our biodiesel to other customers on equivalent terms as potential demand from other customers for biodiesel exceeds our production capacity; (ii) our sales to these customers are not under fixed terms and the customers have no fixed obligation to purchase any minimum quantities except as stipulated by short-term purchase orders; and (iii) the prices we receive from these customers are based upon then-market rates, as would be the case with sales of this commodity to other customers. 
 
 Biofuel gross loss was 3,024 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease in gross profit of 16 from the comparative period in 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from reduced sales volumes, primarily stemming from delays by equipment suppliers that created an extended service utility downtime, which prevented us from building the biodiesel inventories we would typically have available to sell in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Also reducing gross profit was the change in the adjustment in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the LIFO method of inventory accounting. This adjustment decreased gross profit 1,038 in the current three-month period as compared to an increase in gross profit of 2,294 in the same period of the prior year. Partially increasing gross profit was: (i) the change in the activity of derivative instruments with a realized gain of 1,691 and an unrealized gain of 256 in the current three-month period as compared to a realized loss of 7,286 and an unrealized loss of 6,782 in the same period of the prior year, and (ii) the change in the number of separated RINs held in inventory at September 30, 2024 with a fair market value of 2,556 as compared to 6,971 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 Biofuel gross profit was 1,942 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6,958 from the comparative period of 2023. This increase resulted from the change in the number of separated RINs held in inventory at September 30, for each year as noted above and the change in the activity of derivative instruments with an unrealized loss of 1,439 in the current nine-month period as compared to an unrealized loss of 3,523 in the same period of the prior year. Partially reducing gross profit was the change in the adjustment in the carrying value of our inventory as determined utilizing the LIFO method of accounting. This adjustment increased gross profit 2,262 in the current nine-month period as compared to an increase in gross profit of 4,918 in the same period of the prior year, and the change in the activity of derivative instruments with a realized gain of 1,337 in the current nine-month period as compared to a realized gain of 2,150 in the same nine months of the prior year. In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by lower RIN prices and in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, from higher costs resulting from extreme winter weather in the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 For our derivative activity, we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The realized and unrealized derivative gains and losses are recorded as cost of goods sold. Our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific guidelines of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. None of the derivative instruments are designated and accounted for as hedges.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Certain long-term contracts had upfront non-cancellable payments considered material rights. The Company applied the renewal option approach in allocating the transaction price to the material rights. For each of these contracts, the Company estimated the expected contractual volumes to be sold at the most likely expected sales price as a basis for allocating the transaction price to the material right. Estimated amortization is updated quarterly on a prospective basis. These custom chemical contracts have payment terms of 30 days. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 
 For most product sales, revenue is recognized when product is shipped from our facilities and risk of loss and title have passed to the customer, which is in accordance with our customer contracts and the stated shipping terms. Nearly all custom manufactured products are manufactured under written master service agreements. Performance chemicals and biodiesel are generally sold pursuant to the terms of written purchase orders. In general, customers do not have any rights of return, except for quality disputes. All of our products are tested for quality before shipment, and historically returns have been inconsequential and we typically do not offer rebates. 
 
 Biodiesel selling prices can at times fluctuate based on the timing of unsold, internally generated RINs. From time to time, sales of biodiesel are on a RINs-free basis. Such method of selling results in applicable RINs being held. The value of the RINs is not reflected in revenue until such time as the RIN sale has been completed. 
 
 Revenue from bill-and-hold transactions in which a performance obligation exists is recognized when the total performance obligation has been met and control of the product has transferred. Bill-and-hold transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were related to custom chemicals customers whereby revenue was recognized in accordance with contractual agreements based upon product being produced and ready for use by the customer. These sales were subject to written monthly purchase orders. The product was custom manufactured and stored at the customer s request and could not be sold to another buyer. Credit and payment terms for bill-and-hold customers are similar to other custom chemicals customers. Revenues under bill-and-hold arrangement s were 10,211 and 32,875 for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 4,482 and 4,317 of bill-and-hold revenue had not shipped, respectively. 

21

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our net cash from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is set forth in the following table.

(7,891) 

We believe that existing cash balances and cash flow to be generated from operating activities and borrowing capacity under the amended and restated credit agreement will be sufficient to fund operations, product development, cash dividends, and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 41,415 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8,458 in the same period of 2023. This increase in cash was primarily attributable to the change in accounts receivable, including accounts receivable - related parties, demonstrating a cash inflow of 15,729. Also contributing to the current period increase in cash was the change in inventory of 8,249, the change in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 6,466, and the change in accounts payable, including accounts payable - related parties, of 4,749. Partially offsetting these cash inflows was the change in the fair value of derivative instruments of 2,084, and the change in net income of 1,292. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 10,176 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 29,716 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This 39,892 decrease in cash was primarily due to the change in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 37,701 and included an increase in capital expenditure of 5,611. Partially offsetting these reductions in cash was the change in the collateralization of derivative instruments of 3,414. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 117,285 and 7,891 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily for payments of dividends on our common stock inclusive of a special dividend of 109,408 paid in the current nine-month period. 

22

Credit Facility 
 
 We have a credit agreement, as amended on March 30, 2020, with a syndicated group of commercial banks for 100,000. The loan is a revolving facility, the proceeds of which may be used for our working capital, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes. The facility terminates on March 30, 2025. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our credit agreement. 
 
 We intend to fund future capital requirements for our businesses from cash flow as well as from existing cash, cash investments, and, if the need should arise, borrowings under our credit facility. We do not believe there will be a need to issue any securities to fund such capital requirements. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 On April 9, 2024, we paid a special dividend of 2.50 per share on our common stock which amounted to 109,408. The declaration of this special dividend was made in the first quarter of 2024. Regular cash dividends of 0.06 per share were paid on our common stock in each quarter of 2024 and 2023. The regular cash dividend amounted to 2,626 in each of the quarters of 2024 and 2023. The declaration of these regular quarterly cash dividends was made in the three months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 
 
 Capital Management 
 
 As a result of our initial equity offering, our subsequent positive operating results, the exercise of warrants, and the issuance of shares in our at-the-market offering, we accumulated excess working capital. Some of this excess working capital has been paid out as special and regular cash dividends. Third parties have not placed significant restrictions on our working capital management decisions. 
 
 A significant portion of these funds were held in cash or cash equivalents at multiple financial institutions such as depositary accounts, money market accounts, and other similar accounts at selected financial institutions. 
 
 Off- Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We engage in two types of transactions to mitigate the impacts of changes in prices for both commodity sales and purchases. First, for our biofuel sales, we enter into the purchase and sale of futures contracts and options on futures contracts of energy commodities. This activity was captured in our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 as derivative instruments recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). Second, for our biofuel feedstocks, we execute purchase contracts and supply agreements with certain vendors that may meet the normal purchase and normal sales exception of ASC 815. These transactions are recognized in earnings and were not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023 to the extent that we are able to apply the normal purchase and normal sales exception of ASC 815. The purchase of biofuels feedstock generally involves two risk components: basis and price. Basis covers any refining or processing required as well as transportation. Price covers the purchases of the actual agricultural commodity. Both basis and price fluctuate over time. A supply agreement with a vendor constitutes a hedge when we have committed to a certain volume of feedstock in a future period and have fixed the basis for that volume. 

23

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 All dollar amounts expressed as numbers in these Market Risk Disclosures are in thousands (except per share amounts). 
 
 In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on our profit, as we have passed some price increases along to our customers. However, we are subject to certain market risks as described below. 
 
 Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Commodity price risk is inherent in the chemicals and biofuels business both with respect to inputs (electricity, coal, raw materials, biofuel feedstock, etc.) and outputs (manufactured chemicals and biofuels). 
 
 We seek to mitigate our market risks associated with the manufacturing and sale of chemicals by entering into long-term sales contracts that include contractual market price adjustment protections to allow changes in market prices of key raw materials to be passed on to the customer. Such price protections are not always obtained, however, and some raw material price risk remains significant. 
 
 In order to manage price risk caused by market fluctuations in biofuel prices, we may enter into exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts. We account for these derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815. Under this standard, the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends upon whether it has been designated as an accounting hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. To qualify for designation as an accounting hedging relationship, specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained. We had no derivative instruments that qualified under these rules as designated accounting hedges in the first nine months of 2024 or 2023. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized at the end of each accounting period and recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of the cost of goods sold within the biodiesel segment. 
 
 Our immediate recognition of derivative instrument gains and losses can cause net income to be volatile from period to period due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the volume of biofuel being sold. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our derivative instruments was a net asset of 297 and 1,736, respectively. 
 
 Our gross profit will be impacted by the prices we pay for raw materials and conversion costs (costs incurred in the production of chemicals and biofuels) for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protection. These items are principally composed of yellow grease, used cooking oil, and cottonseed oil. The availability and price of these items are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, governmental policies, commodity markets, and global supply and demand. 

24

We prepared a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to market risk with respect to key raw materials and conversion costs for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protections, based on average prices for the first nine months of 2024. We included only those raw materials and conversion costs for which a hypothetical adverse change in price would result in a 1 or greater decrease in gross profit. Assuming that the prices of the associated finished goods could not be increased and assuming no change in quantities sold, a hypothetical 10 change in the average price of the commodity listed below would result in the following change in gross profit.

(a) Volume requirements and average price information are based upon volumes used and prices obtained for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Volume requirements may differ materially from these quantities in future years as our business evolves. 

We had no borrowings at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023, and as such, we were not exposed to interest rate risk for those periods. Due to the relative insignificance of transactions denominated in foreign currency, we consider our foreign currency risk to be immaterial.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Management s Evaluation of our Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and our principal financial officer and other senior management personnel, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures, at September 30, 2024, were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported accurately and within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

26

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are not a party to, nor is any of our property subject to, any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business. However, from time to time, we may be a party to, or a target of, lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which we expect to be handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. While we are unable to predict the outcome of any matters currently pending, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, adverse developments could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in future periods.

Special Note Regarding Forward - Looking Information 
 
 This report, and the documents incorporated by reference into this report contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements deal with our current plans, intentions, beliefs, and expectations, and statements of future economic performance. Statements containing such terms as believe, do not believe, plan, expect, intend, estimate, anticipate, and other phrases of similar meaning are considered to contain uncertainty and are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time we or our representatives have made or will make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements may be included in various filings that we make with the SEC, or in press releases, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those set forth under the headings Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in FutureFuel s Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our future filings made with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this report which reflect our management s opinions only as of their respective dates. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described in this report and in subsequent filings with the SEC are not the only ones we face. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. There may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. If any such risks occur, our business, operating results, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. You should consult any additional disclosures we have made or will make in our reports to the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, and any amendments thereto. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this report.
