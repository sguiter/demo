 During the 13 weeks ended September 26, 2024, on July 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Master Note Purchase Agreement with several purchasers party to the agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two tranches: (i) in aggregate principal amount of the Company s Series 2024 Senior Notes, Tranche A due July 9, 2031 (the Tranche A Notes and (ii) in aggregate principal amount of the Company s Series 2024 Senior Notes, Tranche B due July 9, 2034 (the Tranche B Notes and, collectively with the Tranche A Notes, the 2024 Senior Notes ).

The Tranche A Notes require annual principal amortization payments beginning in fiscal 2027 with a final maturity in fiscal 2031. The Tranche B Notes require annual principal amortization payments beginning in fiscal 2028 with a final maturity in fiscal 2034. The Master Note Purchase Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries that are consistent with the restrictions, covenants and collateral provisions in the Company s existing Credit Agreement and Note Purchase Agreements.

 On September 17, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to issue and sell aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the Indenture ), dated September 22, 2020, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. 
 The Convertible Notes bear interest from September 22, 2020 at a rate of per year.

of the product of the last reported sale price of the Common Stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 15, 2025, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. 
 Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes may be settled, at the Company s election, in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof. The initial conversion rate was 90.8038 shares of Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of Common Stock), representing an initial conversion premium of approximately to the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2020. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events, including distributions and dividends paid to holders of Common Stock. At September 26, 2024, the applicable conversion rate is 94.3588 shares of Common Stock per 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an applicable conversion price of approximately per share of Common Stock). The Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes before maturity and no sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. 
 Since the Company s fiscal 2021 second quarter through the Company s fiscal 2024 second quarter, the Company s Convertible Notes were eligible for conversion at the option of the holders as the last reported sale price of the Common Stock was greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days during the last consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. During the Company s fiscal 2024 third quarter the Convertible Notes were not eligible for conversion at the option of the holders as the last reported sale price of the Common Stock was not greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days during the last consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter. The Company has the ability to settle the conversion in Company stock. The Convertible Notes are eligible for conversion at the option of the holders during the Company s fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. 
 In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes on September 17, 2020, and in connection with the exercise by the Initial Purchasers (as defined in the Convertible Notes purchase agreement) of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes on September 18, 2020, the Company entered into privately negotiated Capped Call Transactions (the Capped Call Transactions with certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the Capped Call Counterparties ). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution of the Company s common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, which initially corresponds to the conversion price of the Convertible Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes. If, however, the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions was initially per share (in no event shall the cap price be less than the strike price of ), which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of the Common Stock of per share on The New York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2020.

 The majority of the Company s lease agreements include fixed rental payments. For those leases with variable payments based on increases in an index subsequent to lease commencement, such payments are recognized as variable lease expense as they occur. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, including those that depend on the Company s performance or use of the underlying asset, are also expensed as incurred. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 General 
 We report our consolidated and individual segment results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Thursday in December. Fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year beginning on December 29, 2023 and ending on December 26, 2024. Fiscal 2023 was a 52-week year that began on December 30, 2022 and ended on December 28, 2023. 
 We divide our fiscal year into three 13-week quarters and a final quarter consisting of 13 or 14 weeks. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 consisted of the 13-week period beginning on June 28, 2024 and ended on September 26, 2024. The third quarter of fiscal 2023 consisted of the 13-week period beginning June 30, 2023 and ended on September 28, 2023. Our primary operations are reported in the following two business segments: movie theatres and hotels and resorts. Within this MD A, amounts for totals, subtotals, and variances may not recalculate exactly within tables due to rounding as they are calculated using the unrounded numbers.

 Overall Results 
 The following table sets forth revenues, operating income, other income (expense), net earnings (loss) and net earnings (loss) per diluted common share for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 (in millions, except for per share and variance percentage data): 
 Third Quarter First Three Quarters Variance Variance F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. Revenues 232.7 208.8 23.9 11.4 547.2 568.0 (20.8) (3.7) Operating income 32.8 20.9 11.8 56.6 18.4 32.8 (14.4) (44.0) Other income (expense) (4.1) (2.8) (1.2) (43.7) (23.4) (9.4) (14.0) (148.9) Net earnings (loss) 23.3 12.2 11.1 90.6 (8.8) 16.2 (25.0) (154.0) Net earnings (loss) per common share - diluted 0.73 0.32 0.41 128.1 (0.28) 0.46 (0.74) (160.9) 
 Revenues increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to increased revenues from both our theatre division and hotels and resorts division. Revenues decreased during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 due to a decrease in revenues from our theatre division, partially offset by increased revenues from our hotels and resorts division. 
 Operating income increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to increased operating income from both our theatre division and hotels and resorts division, partially offset by an increase in corporate operating losses. Operating income decreased during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 primarily due to a decrease in operating income from our theatre division and an increase in corporate operating losses, partially offset by increased operating income from our hotels and resorts division. 
 Net earnings and net earnings per diluted common share increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to increased operating income and investment income, partially offset by the impact of debt conversion expense. Net earnings (loss) and net earnings (loss) per diluted common share decreased during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 due to decreased operating income and the impact of debt conversion expense, partially offset by increased investment income and lower interest expense. 
 Other income (expense) during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 were negatively impacted by debt conversion expense of 1.4 million and 15.3 million, respectively, in connection with the 99.9 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes Repurchases. See Convertible Senior Notes Repurchases in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD A for further discussion. 
 We recognized investment income of 0.8 million and 1.7 million during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively, compared to 0.4 million and 1.1 million during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. Variations in investment income were due to changes in the value of marketable securities. 
 Our interest expense totaled 3.1 million and 8.2 million for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively, compared to 2.9 million and 9.0 million for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. The decrease in interest expense during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to decreased borrowings and a decrease in non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs. Changes in our borrowing levels due to variations in our operating results, capital expenditures, acquisition opportunities (or the lack thereof) and asset sale proceeds, among other items, may impact, either favorably or unfavorably, our actual reported interest expense in future periods, as may changes in short-term interest rates. 
 We reported income tax expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 of 5.4 million compared to income tax expense of 5.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We reported income tax expense for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 of 3.8 million compared to income tax expense of 7.1 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2024 first three quarters effective income tax rate was (74.9) , and was negatively impacted by nondeductible debt conversion expense resulting from the Convertible Notes Repurchases and a 1.2 million reduction in deferred tax assets resulting from the related termination of the Capped Call Transactions (combined negative impact of approximately 108 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 percentage points) and excess compensation subject to deduction limitations. Our fiscal 2023 first three quarters effective income tax rate was 30.5 . We anticipate that our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2024 may be in the (200) to (210) range, which includes an estimated negative impact of approximately 240 percentage points from the Convertible Notes Repurchases and termination of the Capped Call Transactions, and excludes any potential changes in federal or state income tax rates, valuation allowance adjustments or other one-time tax benefits. Our actual fiscal 2024 effective income tax rate may be different from our estimated quarterly rates depending upon actual facts and circumstances. 
 
 Theatres 
 The following table sets forth revenues, operating income and operating margin for our theatre division for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 (in millions, except for variance percentage and operating margin): 
 Third Quarter First Three Quarters Variance Variance F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. Revenues 143.8 126.6 17.3 13.6 326.6 359.8 (33.2) (9.2) Operating income 21.8 11.4 10.4 91.3 18.8 32.7 (13.9) (42.5) Operating margin of revenues) 15.1 9.0 5.8 9.1 
 Our theatre division revenues and operating income increased with stronger performances from blockbuster films during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, our theatre division revenues and operating income decreased compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, driven by a weaker film slate in the first half of fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase in film performance in the third quarter. The film slate in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 was negatively impacted by the content supply chain disruption from the shutdown of movie production during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA labor strikes in 2023, which contributed to a weaker slate of available films, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2024, compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, resulting in decreased theatre attendance. 
 The following table provides a further breakdown of the components of revenues for the theatre division for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 (in millions, except for variance percentage): 
 Third Quarter First Three Quarters Variance Variance F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. Admission revenues 69.0 63.7 5.3 8.4 158.2 180.3 (22.1) (12.3) Concession revenues 62.1 54.6 7.6 13.9 141.2 156.6 (15.4) (9.8) Other revenues 12.1 8.4 3.7 44.2 26.5 22.9 3.6 15.8 Total revenues 143.2 126.6 16.6 13.1 325.9 359.8 (33.9) (9.4) 
 According to data received from Comscore (a national box office reporting service for the theatre industry) and compiled by us to evaluate our fiscal 2024 third quarter and first three quarters results, U.S. box office receipts increased 3.8 during our fiscal 2024 third quarter compared to the same comparable weeks in fiscal 2023, indicating that our increase of 9.5 in admission revenues for comparable theatres (excluding theatres closed during the past year) during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 outperformed the industry by 5.7 percentage points. We believe our over-performance is attributable to a favorable film mix during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 that included Deadpool Wolverine, Despicable Me 4, Twisters, Inside Out 2, and It Ends with Us, that was more appealing to audiences in our Midwestern markets. Additionally, we believe changes to our Value Tuesday program made during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, including reintroducing free complimentary-sized popcorn for Magical Movie Reward (MMR) members on Tuesdays, have positively contributed to our outperformance. 
 Data received and complied by us from Comscore also indicates U.S. box office receipts decreased 11.0 during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the same comparable weeks in fiscal 2023, indicating that our decrease of 11.3 in admission revenues for comparable theatres (excluding theatres closed during the past year) during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 underperformed the industry by 0.3 percentage points. We believe the slight underperformance during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 is due to an unfavorable film mix primarily during the first half of fiscal 2024 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 that was more appealing to audiences in other parts of the U.S. than in our Midwestern markets compared to a favorable film mix during the first half of fiscal 2023, partially offset by a favorable film slate and increased performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Additional data received and compiled by us from Comscore indicates our admission revenues at comparable theatres during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 represented approximately 3.1 and 3.0 , respectively, of the total admission revenues in the U.S. (commonly referred to as market share in our industry), compared to 2.9 and 3.1 during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. Our goal is to continue our historical long-term pattern of outperforming the industry, but our ability to do so in any given quarter will likely be partially dependent upon film mix, weather and the competitive landscape in our markets. 
 Total theatre attendance for our comparable theatres increased 7.1 during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which was primarily attributable to a stronger film slate, higher box office performance from the top films during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the top films last fiscal year during the third quarter, and an increase in the number of films released during the fiscal 2024 third quarter. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024 there were 30 wide-release films (films showed in over approximately 1,500 theatres in the U.S.) compared to 24 wide-release films during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Total theatre attendance for our comparable theatres decreased 11.8 during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period, resulting primarily from the weaker film slate in the first half of fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase in theatre attendance during fiscal 2024 third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 there were 82 wide-release films compared to 76 wide-release films during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, with the increase in wide release films occurring entirely in the third quarter. While the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to the first half of fiscal 2023 was comprised of a similar number of wide releases, there were fewer major franchise titles and an overall lower quality of film product during the first half of fiscal 2024, though film product quantity and quality significantly improved during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Our highest grossing films during the fiscal 2024 third quarter included Deadpool Wolverine, Despicable Me 4, Twisters, Inside Out 2, and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice . Our top five films during our fiscal 2024 third quarter accounted for 66 of our total box office results, compared to 56 (including event cinema in both periods) for the top five films during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, both expressed as a percentage of the total admission revenues for the relevant period. An increased concentration of blockbuster films during a given quarter often has the effect of increasing our film rental costs during the period, as generally the better a particular film performs, the greater the film rental cost tends to be as a percentage of box office receipts. As a result of a more concentrated film slate, our overall film cost as a percentage of admission revenues increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. 
 Our average ticket price increased 2.6 during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, our average ticket price increased 0.9 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. Our average ticket price during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by an increased percentage of ticket sales coming from Premium Large Format (PLF) screens and evening showings, partially offset by the negative impact of an increased percentage of our weekly attendance coming from Value Tuesday, and promotional pricing offerings, including a 7 Everyday Matinee for seniors and children that was introduced during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The overall change in average ticket price favorably impacted our admission revenues of our comparable theatres by 1.5 million and 0.9 million during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. 
 Our average concession revenues per person increased by 7.9 and 3.7 during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively, due to market pricing adjustments, as well an increase in the number of concessions, food and beverage transactions per ticket sold, or our hit rate . During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we made changes to our Value Tuesday promotion for our MMR loyalty members, discontinuing the prior promotion that offered a 20 discount on all concessions, food and non-alcoholic beverages and reintroducing a free complimentary-sized popcorn, which has been well received by guests. The overall increase in average concession revenues per person favorably impacted our concession revenues of our comparable theatres by 4.3 million and 4.6 million during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. 
 Other revenues during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased by 3.7 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 due to the impact of increased attendance on internet surcharge ticketing fees and preshow and in-app advertising revenue. 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 Late during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we made changes to the criteria for waiving internet surcharge ticket fees for our MMR members, resulting in an increase in ticketing fees per person during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Other revenues during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 increased by 3.6 million compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 due to an increase in internet surcharge ticketing fees per person, partially offset by the impact of overall decreased attendance on internet surcharge ticketing fees and preshow and in-app advertising revenue during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. 
 The quantity, quality, and mix of films available for theatrical exhibition, including wide-release films, was negatively impacted during fiscal 2024 by the shutdown of movie production resulting from the WGA and SAG-AFTRA labor strikes that occurred during fiscal 2023. While the labor strikes were resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with film production resuming thereafter, the quantity of new film releases available for theatrical exhibition during fiscal 2024 was negatively impacted by the prolonged shutdown of movie production during the first half of the year, as was the overall quality of the films released, as several film release dates for major motion pictures were shifted to fiscal 2025. While lead times for movie production to theatrical release are lengthy, based upon projected film and alternate content availability, we currently estimate that we may once again show an increased number of films and alternate content events on our screens during fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. 
 We ended the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with a total of 981 company-owned screens in 78 theatres and 14 managed screens at one theatre, compared to 993 company-owned screens in 79 theatres at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We made decisions to close several underperforming theatres during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, including one of our owned theatres in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, two owned theatres in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, two owned theatres and one leased theatre in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and one leased theatre in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we added one theatre that we manage for the owner of a lifestyle shopping center. 
 
 Hotels and Resorts 
 The following table sets forth revenues, operating income and operating margin for our hotels and resorts division for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 (in millions, except for variance percentage and operating margin):

 Hotels and resorts revenues increased 8.1 and 6.0 during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. Revenues were favorably impacted by approximately 3.3 million from the Republican National Convention (RNC) held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our hotels and resorts division operating income increased 2.7 million and 2.5 million during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively, primarily due to an increase in revenue from the RNC during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense from hotel renovations placed in service during fiscal 2023 and 2024.

 The following table provides a further breakdown of the components of revenues for the hotels and resorts division for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 (in millions, except for variance percentage): 
 Third Quarter First Three Quarters Variance Variance F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. Room revenues 40.0 36.5 3.6 9.8 88.7 83.0 5.8 7.0 Food/beverage revenues 22.3 20.2 2.1 10.2 57.7 54.0 3.7 6.9 Other revenues 16.7 15.4 1.3 8.1 44.3 41.9 2.5 5.9 Total revenues before cost reimbursements 79.0 72.1 6.9 9.6 190.8 178.8 12.0 6.7 Cost reimbursements 9.7 10.0 (0.2) (2.5) 29.6 29.2 0.5 1.6 Total revenues 88.7 82.1 6.6 8.1 220.4 208.0 12.5 6.0 
 Division total revenues before cost reimbursements increased 9.6 and 6.7 during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively, due primarily to an increase in group business revenues (including from the RNC) that offset lower weekend leisure travel demand. The increase in group business in fiscal 2024 has resulted in an increase in banquet and catering sales, positively impacting food and beverage revenues compared to the fiscal 2023 periods. 
 The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, including our average occupancy percentage (number of occupied rooms as a percentage of available rooms), our average daily room rate, or ADR, and our total revenue per available room, or RevPAR, for comparable company-owned properties: 
 Third Quarter First Three Quarters Variance Variance F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. F2024 F2023 Amt. Pct. Occupancy pct. 76.7 76.5 0.2 pts 0.3 67.7 65.2 2.5 pts 3.8 ADR 233.41 213.05 20.36 9.6 194.79 189.09 5.70 3.0 RevPAR 178.94 163.00 15.94 9.8 131.84 123.23 8.61 7.0 
 Note: These operating statistics represent averages of our seven distinct comparable company-owned hotels and resorts, branded and unbranded, in different geographic markets with a wide range of individual hotel performance. The statistics are not necessarily representative of any particular hotel or resort. 
 RevPAR increased at four of our seven comparable company-owned properties during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 driven primarily by the impact of high daily rates during the RNC during our fiscal 2024 third quarter. Excluding the impact of the RNC, average daily rates during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were effectively flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Group demand continued to grow during the fiscal 2024 third quarter, with weekday occupancy growth due to increased group business as a percentage of our overall business mix. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our group business represented approximately 47.3 of our total rooms revenue (43.1 excluding group business from the RNC), compared to approximately 40.7 during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the positive impact of group business associated with the RNC, an increase in group business as a percentage of our overall business mix generally increases overall occupancy while negatively impacting ADR. Non-group pricing decreased in some of our major markets during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, due to generally lower transient leisure travel demand and due to a shift in pricing strategy as we optimized pricing to drive higher occupancy and overall RevPAR through lower daily rate offerings. 
 According to data received from Smith Travel Research and compiled by us in order to evaluate our fiscal 2024 third quarter and first three quarters results, comparable upper upscale hotels hotels identified as our industry throughout the United States experienced an increase in RevPAR of 1.4 during our fiscal 2024 third quarter compared to the same period during fiscal 2023, leading us to believe we outperformed the industry during the fiscal 2024 third quarter by approximately 8.4 percentage points. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, comparable upper upscale hotels experienced an increase in RevPAR of 2.1 , leading us to believe we outperformed the industry during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 by 4.9 percentage points. We believe our 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 outperformance during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 results primarily from our strong performance in the group customer segment, incremental revenue from the RNC, as well as improved revenue management and rate optimization resulting in higher occupancy growth compared to the rest of the industry. 
 Data received from Smith Travel Research for our various competitive sets hotels identified in our specific markets that we deem to be competitors to our hotels indicates that these hotels experienced an increase in RevPAR of 12.4 during our fiscal 2024 third quarter, again compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Therefore, we underperformed our competitive sets during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by approximately 2.6 percentage points. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, hotels in our competitive sets experienced an increase in RevPAR of 7.6 , indicating that we underperformed our competitive set hotels by approximately 0.6 percentage points. We believe our underperformance to our competitive sets during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024 results from our mix of RNC business and airline crew business compared to our competitive sets, as well as new hotel room supply within one of our markets. 
 Looking to future periods, overall occupancy in the U.S. is expected to continue to slowly increase. In the near term, we expect leisure travel demand to continue to normalize to long-term historical demand levels, and we expect our group business to remain strong. Leisure travel in our markets has a seasonal component, peaking in the summer months and slowing down as children return to school and the weather turns colder in our primarily Midwestern markets. We expect gradual increases in business travel as corporate training events, meetings, and conferences return and office occupancy increases. As of the date of this report, our group room revenue bookings for the remainder of fiscal 2024 - commonly referred to in the hotels and resorts industry as group pace - is running approximately 11 ahead of where we were at the same time last year. Group room revenue bookings for fiscal 2025 is running over 30 ahead of where we were at the same time in fiscal 2023 for fiscal 2024, excluding bookings related to the July 2024 RNC. Banquet and catering revenue pace for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 is similarly running ahead of where we were at this same time last year, excluding bookings related to the July 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. We are encouraged by continuing positive trends in group bookings for the remainder of fiscal 2024, fiscal 2025 and beyond. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance and enterprise value. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure for us and investors, as it eliminates certain expenses that are not indicative of our core operating performance and facilitates a comparison of our core operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a basis to determine certain annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards, to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by analysts, investors and other interested parties as a performance measure to evaluate industry competitors. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or free cash flow for management s discretionary use. Adjusted EBITDA has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to The Marcus Corporation before investment income or loss, interest expense, other expense, gain or loss on disposition of property, equipment and other assets, impairment charges, equity earnings or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures, net earnings or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation expense, adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the items eliminated in the adjustments made to determine Adjusted EBITDA, such as acquisition expenses, preopening expenses, accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other adjustments. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Definitions and calculations of Adjusted EBITDA differ among companies in our industries, and therefore Adjusted EBITDA disclosed by us may not be comparable to the measures disclosed by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Our movie theatre and hotels and resorts businesses each generate significant and consistent daily amounts of cash, subject to previously-noted seasonality, because each segment s revenue is derived predominantly from consumer cash purchases. We believe that these relatively consistent and predictable cash sources, as well as the availability of unused credit lines, would be adequate to support the ongoing operational liquidity needs of our businesses. 
 Maintaining and protecting a strong balance sheet has always been a core value of The Marcus Corporation during our 89-year history and our financial position remains strong. As of September 26, 2024, we had a cash balance of approximately 28.4 million, 220.2 million of availability under our 225 million revolving credit facility, our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.27, and our net leverage ratio was 1.67x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. With our strong liquidity position combined with cash generated from operations, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due and to comply with our debt covenants for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as fund our longer-term capital requirements.

 We believe Net Leverage is a useful measure, as it provides management and investors an indication of our indebtedness less unrestricted cash relative to our earnings performance. 
 Financial Condition 
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled 51.4 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 68.6 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The 17.3 million decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a 25.0 million decrease in net earnings, a 1.3 million increase in cash matching contributions to our retirement savings and profit-sharing plan, a decrease in deferred income tax benefits and unfavorable changes in working capital, partially offset by a 15.3 million non-cash debt conversion expense and an increase in non-cash share-based compensation expense. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 totaled 58.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 26.9 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities of 31.5 million was the result of an increase of 27.9 million in capital expenditures, and a 5.6 million purchase of joint venture interests in The Lofton Hotel, partially offset by a 1.5 million sale of joint venture interests in The Lofton Hotel to other minority investors. Total cash capital expenditures (including normal continuing capital maintenance and renovation projects) totaled 53.8 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to 25.8 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 Fiscal 2024 first three quarters cash capital expenditures included approximately 11.4 million incurred in our theatre division, primarily related to normal maintenance capital projects. We incurred capital expenditures in our hotels and resorts division during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 of approximately 36.6 million, including costs related to guest room renovations at The Pfister Hotel, associate housing construction and meeting space renovations at the Grand Geneva Resort and Spa and normal maintenance capital projects. We incurred corporate capital expenditures during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 of approximately 5.8 million primarily related to office construction for the relocation of our corporate and divisional headquarters (a portion of which will be reimbursed by the landlord in a future period). 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 totaled 19.8 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 26.2 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility as needed to fund our cash needs and used excess cash to reduce our borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As short-term revolving credit facility borrowings became due, we replaced them as necessary with new short-term revolving credit facility borrowings. As a result, we added 81.0 million of new short-term revolving credit facility borrowings, and we made 81.0 million of repayments on short-term revolving credit facility borrowings during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 (net zero borrowings on our credit facility). We ended the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

 During the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility as needed to fund our cash needs and used excess cash to reduce our borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we added 38.0 million of new short-term revolving credit facility borrowings, and we made 38.0 million of repayments on short-term revolving credit facility borrowings during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 (net zero borrowings on our credit facility). 
 Principal payments on long-term debt were approximately 11.0 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to payments of 11.1 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 we received 100.0 million of cash proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in July 2024. See Master Note Purchase Agreement for further discussion below. 
 During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 we paid 102.5 million in cash for the Convertible Notes Repurchases (as defined below) and related transaction costs, with no repurchases in fiscal 2023. We received 13.2 million in cash from the proportionate unwind of the Capped Call Transactions in connection with the Convertible Notes Repurchases during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. See Convertible Senior Notes Repurchases for further discussion below. 
 Our debt-to-capitalization ratio (excluding our finance and operating lease obligations) was 0.27 at September 26, 2024, compared to 0.26 at December 28, 2023. 
 During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we repurchased 0.7 million shares of our common stock for 9.7 million in the open market, compared to no share repurchases of our common stock in the open market during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. As of September 26, 2024, approximately 1.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under prior Board of Directors repurchase authorizations. Under these authorizations, we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market, pursuant to privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, depending upon a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions. 
 Dividends paid during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 were 6.6 million. Dividends paid during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 were 5.3 million. We have the ability to declare quarterly dividend payments and/or repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market as we deem appropriate. 
 Convertible Senior Notes Repurchases 
 During the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we entered into separate, privately negotiated purchase agreements (the Purchase Agreements with certain holders of its Convertible Notes. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreements, the holders agreed to exchange 99.9 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes for cash consideration of 121.5 million (or 103.3 million net of the cash we received in connection with the unwind of a portion of the Capped Call Transactions as discussed below) effected over three separate repurchase tranches (the Convertible Notes Repurchases ). On May 8, 2024, we entered into the first repurchase transaction to retire 40.0 million of aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes for 45.9 million in cash consideration plus accrued interest, with settlement occurring during the fiscal second quarter on June 14, 2024. On June 17, 2024, we entered into the second repurchase transaction to retire 46.4 million of aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes for 55.2 million in cash consideration plus accrued interest, with settlement occurring during the fiscal third quarter on July 16, 2024. On September 19, 2024, we entered into the third repurchase transaction to retire 13.5 million of aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes for 20.4 million in cash consideration plus accrued interest, with settlement occurring during the fiscal fourth quarter on October 11, 2024. Following settlement of the Convertible Note Repurchases on October 11, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding was 0.1 million . 
 In connection with the Convertible Notes Repurchases, we entered into unwind agreements with the Capped Call Counterparties to terminate a portion of the Capped Call Transactions equal to the notional amounts of the Convertible Notes Repurchases, and to receive aggregate cash of 18.2 million effected over two separate unwind tranches. On May 8, 2024, we entered into the first tranche of unwind agreements and received 5.8 million in cash consideration with settlement occurring during the fiscal second quarter on June 14, 2024. On June 17, 2024, we entered into the second tranche of unwind agreements and received 7.5 million in cash consideration at settlement occurring during the fiscal third quarter on July 16, 2024. 
 During the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024, we incurred debt conversion expense of 1.4 million and 15.3 million, respectively, in connection with the Convertible Notes Repurchases. The unwind of the Capped Call

 Transactions resulted in a 4.7 million and 17.6 million increase in capital in excess of par within shareholders equity during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively. 
 Master Note Purchase Agreement 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, on July 9, 2024, we entered into a Master Note Purchase Agreement with several purchasers party to the agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in two tranches: (i) 60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company s 6.89 Series 2024 Senior Notes, Tranche A due July 9, 2031 (the Tranche A Notes and (ii) 40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company s 7.02 Series 2024 Senior Notes, Tranche B due July 9, 2034 (the Tranche B Notes and, collectively with the Tranche A Notes, the 2024 Senior Notes ). The net proceeds were used to refinance the Convertible Notes Repurchases of 99.9 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes and for general corporate purposes. 
 Interest on the 2024 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on the 9th day of January and July each year, commencing on January 9, 2025, and on the applicable maturity date. The Tranche A Notes require annual principal amortization payments beginning in fiscal 2027 with a final maturity in fiscal 2031. The Tranche B Notes require annual principal amortization payments beginning in fiscal 2028 with a final maturity in fiscal 2034. The Master Note Purchase Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries that are consistent with the restrictions, covenants and collateral provisions in the Company s existing Credit Agreement and Note Purchase Agreements. Among other requirements, the Master Note Purchase Agreement requires us to maintain (i) a ratio of consolidated net debt (as defined in the Master Note Purchase Agreement) to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Master Note Purchase Agreement) of 3.50 to 1.00 or less, with some temporary exceptions for material acquisitions, and (ii) a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as defined in the Master Note Purchase Agreement) for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters (determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter) of 3.00 to 1.00 or more.
