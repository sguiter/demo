 ) ) Collateralized loan obligations ) ) Corporate bonds ) ) ) Total available-for-sale ) ) ) Assessment of Available for Sale Debt Securities for Credit Risk Management assesses the decline in fair value of investment securities periodically. Unrealized losses on debt securities may occur from current market conditions, increases in interest rates since the time of purchase, a structural change in an investment, volatility of earnings of a specific issuer, or deterioration in credit quality of the issuer. Management evaluates both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess whether an impairment exists. The following is a discussion of the credit quality characteristics of portfolio segments carrying unrealized losses at September 30, 2024. Obligations of U.S. Government agencies and sponsored entities The mortgage-backed securities held by the Company were issued by U.S government-sponsored entities and agencies. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality. The Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company considers these securities to carry zero loss estimates and allowance for credit losses was recorded at September 30, 2024. Corporate bonds The Company s corporate bond portfolio is comprised of subordinated debt issues of community and regional banks. Management considers the credit quality of each individual investment. Management reviewed the collectibility of these investments, taking into account such factors as the financial condition of the issuers, reported regulatory capital ratios, and credit ratings, when available, and other factors. All corporate bond debt securities continue to accrue interest and make payments as expected with no defaults or deferrals on the part of the issuers. The Company considers the potential credit risk of the issuers to be immaterial and has t allocated an allowance for credit losses on its corporate bond portfolio as of September 30, 2024.

 Multi-family Commercial real estate Commercial and industrial Construction and land development Consumer Total The Company recognized million and million of interest income on nonaccrual loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Individually Analyzed Loans Effective October 1, 2023, the Company began analyzing loans on an individual basis when management determined that the loan no longer exhibited risk characteristics consistent with the risk characteristics existing in its designed pool of loans, under the Company s CECL methodology. Loans individually analyzed include certain nonaccrual loans. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of individually analyzed loans amounted to million, of which million were considered collateral dependent. For collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is likely to be substantially provided through the sale or operation of the collateral, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral adjusted for sales costs and the amortized cost basis of the loan, at measurement date. Certain assets held as collateral may be exposed to future deterioration in fair value, particularly due to changes in real estate markets or usage. The following tables present the amortized cost basis and related allowance for credit loss of individually analyzed loans considered to be collateral dependent as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The Company may occasionally make modifications to loans where the borrower is considered to be in financial distress. Types of modifications include principal reductions, significant payment delays, term extensions, interest rate reductions or a combination thereof. The amount of principal reduction is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. The following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans at September 30, 2024 that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, by class and type of modification. The percentage of the amortized cost basis of loans that were modified to borrowers in financial distress as compared to the amortized cost basis of each class of financing receivable is also presented below:

Table of Contents 
 The Company had commitment to lend additional funds to the borrowers included in the previous table. The Company monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. such loans that have been modified in the last 12 months were past due. Upon the Company s determination that a modified loan (or a portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, loans that were modified in the last 12 months to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty had a payment default. Credit Quality Indicators: The Company has adopted a credit risk rating system as part of the risk assessment of its loan portfolio. The Company s lending officers are required to assign a credit risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination. When the lender learns of important financial developments, the risk rating is reviewed and adjusted if necessary. In addition, the Company engages a third-party independent loan reviewer that performs quarterly reviews of a sample of loans, validating the credit risk ratings assigned to such loans. The credit risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the loan loss provision and to confirm the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes commercial loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: Special Mention: The loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Substandard: The loan is inadequately protected by current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as Substandard must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful: The loan has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing factors, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans not having a credit risk rating of Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful are considered pass loans.

The Company has determined these are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Derivatives represent interest rate swaps for which the estimated fair values are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date resulting in a Level 2 classification. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future servicing income. The valuation model utilizes interest rate, prepayment speed, and default rate assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. The fair value of loan servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2024 was determined based on discounted expected future cash flows using discount rates ranging from to , prepayment speeds ranging from to and a weighted average life ranging from to years.

 Non-GAAP Disclosure - This discussion includes discussions of the Company s tangible common equity TCE ratio, TCE, tangible assets and efficiency ratio, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or modifies amounts that are required to be disclosed in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide both management and investors a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and the Company s marketplace performance. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the numbers prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other financial institutions. With respect to the calculations and reconciliations of TCE, tangible assets and the TCE ratio, please see Liquidity and Capital Resources contained herein for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Executive Summary The Company is a one-bank holding company incorporated in 2016. The Company operates as the parent for its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, which commenced operations in 2008. The income of the Company is primarily derived through the operations of the Bank. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein to the Company include the Company and the Bank on a consolidated basis. The Bank operates as a locally headquartered, community-oriented bank, serving customers throughout the New York metro area from offices in Nassau, Suffolk, Queens, Kings (Brooklyn) and New York (Manhattan) Counties, New York and Freehold in Monmouth County, New Jersey. We opened the Bank s Hauppauge Business Banking Center in Hauppauge, Suffolk County, New York in May 2023. This location is the nexus of our expanded commercial lending and deposit activities that are integral to the ongoing diversification of our balance sheet as we fill the void left by the diminishing number of commercial banks in the NYC Metro area. The Bank has received regulatory approval for the opening of a full-service branch in Port Jefferson, New York. Business development staff have already joined the Bank in anticipation of the opening of this location. The Bank expects this site to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2025. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, we began offering business banking services to the legal, licensed cannabis industry in New York and other states in which cannabis is legally licensed under applicable state laws. We offer personal and business loans on a secured and unsecured basis, SBA and USDA guaranteed loans, revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgage loans, and one- to four-family non-qualified mortgages secured by primary and secondary residences that may be owner occupied or investment properties, home equity loans, bridge loans and other personal purpose loans. The Bank works to provide more direct, personal attention to customers than management believes is offered by competing financial institutions, the majority of which are headquartered outside of the Bank s primary trade area and are represented locally by branch offices. By striving to employ professional, responsive and knowledgeable staff, the Bank believes it offers a superior level of service to its customers. As a result of senior management s availability for consultation on a daily basis, the Bank believes it offers customers quicker responses on loan applications and other banking transactions, as well as greater and earlier certainty as to whether these transactions will actually close, than competitors, whose decisions may take longer and be made in distant headquarters. Historically, the Bank has generated additional income by strategically originating and selling residential and government guaranteed loans to other financial institutions at premiums, while also retaining servicing rights in some sales. However, with the rapid increases in interest rates in recent years, the appetite among the Bank s purchasers of residential loans for pools of loans declined, eliminating the Bank s ability to sell residential loans in its portfolio on desirable terms. Commencing in late 2023, the Bank initiated development of a flow origination program under which the Bank originates individual loans for sale to specific buyers, thereby positioning the Bank to resume residential loan sales and generate fee income to complement sale premiums earned from the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans. The Bank is an approved SBA Preferred Lender, enabling the Bank to process SBA applications under delegated authority from the SBA and enhancing the Bank s ability to compete more effectively for SBA lending opportunities.

 We expect the volume of activity to increase as the year progresses and our flow pipeline continues to build. Because we continue to prioritize the management of liquidity and capital, new business development is largely focused on flow originations over portfolio growth. The Bank finances most of its activities through a combination of deposits, including non-interest-bearing demand, savings, NOW and money market deposits as well as time deposits, and both short- and long-term borrowings. The Company s chief competition includes local banks within its market area, New York City money center banks and regional banks, as well as non-bank lenders, including fintech lenders.

(3) The ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets is the most comparable GAAP measure to the non-GAAP tangible common equity ratio presented herein. At September 30, 2024 the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of 2.3 billion, total deposits of 2.0 billion and total stockholders equity of 192.3 million. The Company recorded net income for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 3.5 million, or 0.48 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares). During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 1.3 million, non-interest income increased 0.2 million, provision for credit losses decreased 0.3 million and income tax expense decreased 0.1 million compared to the September 30, 2023 quarter. These were offset by an increase of 1.9 million in non-interest expenses, particularly salaries and employee benefits, resulting in flat earnings between these periods. The Company s return on average assets and return on average stockholders equity were 0.62 and 7.35 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 0.66 and 7.58 , respectively, for the comparable 2023 period. Total non-accrual loans at September 30, 2024 were 15.4 million, or 0.77 of total loans, compared to 14.5 million, or 0.74 of total loans at December 31, 2023 and 14.9 million, or 0.80 of total loans, at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans amounted to 152 , 136 and 98 at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 The Company s operating efficiency ratio was 71.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 66.5 in the year ago period. The increase in the operating efficiency ratio was due to the increase in non-interest expense, which was partially offset by increases in net interest income and non-interest income. Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates - To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, the Company s management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and in Note 1 Accounting Policies of this Form 10-Q. Commencing on October 1, 2023 the Company adopted CECL which changed the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates from policies regarding the calculation of the allowance for loan losses to policies regarding the calculation of an allowance for credit losses. Allowance for Credit Losses On October 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326), which replaced the incurred loss methodology with CECL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for management s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The process to determine expected credit losses utilizes analytic tools and judgment and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. When management is reasonably certain that a loan balance is not fully collectable, an analysis is completed and an allowance may be established or a full or partial charge off could be recorded against the allowance. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance via a quantitative analysis which considers available information from internal and external sources related to past loan loss and prepayment experience and current conditions, as well as the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management evaluates a variety of factors including available published economic information in arriving at its forecast. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans and adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. Also included in the allowance for credit losses are qualitative reserves that are expected, but, in management s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative analysis or the forecasts described above. Factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, size and composition of the portfolio, experience and depth of lending management and the effect of external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory requirements, among others. The allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged off. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for credit losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require the Company to make additional provisions for credit losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination. The Bank considers its primary lending area to be the New York metro area. A substantial portion of the Bank s loans are secured by real estate in this area. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market and economic conditions in this region. Future adjustments to the provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the Company s control. Financial Condition Total assets of the Company were 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. Total securities available for sale at September 30, 2024 was 98.4 million, an increase of 36.9 million from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by growth in U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Total loans at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 2.0 billion. Total deposits were 2.0 billion and 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, respectively. Total borrowings and subordinated debt at September 30, 2024 were 150.5 million, including 125.8 million of outstanding FHLB advances, compared to 153.6 million at December 31, 2023.

 At September 30, 2024, the residential loan portfolio amounted to 745.9 million, or 37.2 of total loans. Commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans and construction and land development loans, totaled 1.1 billion or 54.2 of total loans at September 30, 2024. Commercial and industrial loans totaled 171.9 million or 8.6 of total loans. Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 2.0 billion, reflecting an increase of 52.9 million or 2.8 , compared to 1.9 billion at December 31, 2023. Our loan to deposit ratio was 102 at September 30, 2024 and 103 at December 31, 2023. Core deposit balances, which consist of demand, NOW, savings and money market deposits, represented 74.2 and 72.6 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At those dates, demand deposit balances represented 10.5 and 10.9 of total deposits. Although core deposits grew to 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024 from 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, demand deposit balances decreased from 207.8 million to 206.3 million during the same period. This decrease was confined to deposits made by residential loan borrowers in anticipation of residential loan closings. These funds comprise the equity residential borrowers are required to contribute to residential loan closings. The volume of these deposits rise and fall in proportion to the volume of anticipated residential loan closings. As the pace of residential lending increases, the volume of demand deposits will increase accordingly. Demand deposits, net of balances related to residential loan closings, grew to 181.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from 166.4 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 9.3 . The Company s municipal deposit program is built on long-standing relationships developed in the local marketplace. This core deposit business will continue to provide a stable source of funding for the Company s lending products at costs lower than both consumer deposits and market-based borrowings. The Company continues to broaden its municipal deposit base and currently services 39 customer relationships. At September 30, 2024, total municipal deposits were 366.2 million, representing 18.7 of total deposits, compared to 528.1 million at December 31, 2023, representing 27.7 of total deposits. Total municipal deposits decreased by 161.9 million or 30.7 from December 31, 2023 primarily due to seasonal variations. The weighted average rate on the municipal deposit portfolio was 4.24 at September 30, 2024. The aggregate amount of the Company s outstanding uninsured deposits was 622.1 million or 31.8 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024 and 771.0 million or 40.5 of total deposits as of December 31, 2023. Borrowings at September 30, 2024 were 125.8 million, versus 129.0 million, including 2.3 million in PPPLF funding, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 125.8 million of outstanding FHLB advances as compared to 126.7 million at December 31, 2023. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under lines of credit with correspondent banks at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage interest rate risk, including interest rate swap agreements, which currently provide a benefit to net interest income. Commercial Real Estate Statistics The Company s commercial real estate concentration ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 397 of capital at September 30, 2024 from 432 of capital at December 31, 2023. A significant portion of the Bank s commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans secured by Multi-Family and CRE-Investor owned real estate that are predominantly subject to fixed interest rates for an initial period of 5 years. The Bank s exposure to Land/Construction loans is minor at 9.5 million, all at floating interest rates, and CRE-owner occupied loans have a sizable mix of floating rates. As shown below, these two portfolios represent 11 combined of loans maturing through the balance of 2024 and 2025, with 55 maturing in 2027 alone.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity management is defined as the ability of the Company and the Bank to meet their financial obligations on a continuous basis without material loss or disruption of normal operations. These obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity, the repayment of borrowings as they mature, funding new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Asset liquidity is provided by short-term investments, such as fed funds sold, the marketability of securities available for sale and interest-bearing deposits due from the Federal Reserve, FHLB and correspondent banks, which totaled 141.2 million and 177.2 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These liquid assets may include assets that have been pledged primarily against municipal deposits or borrowings. Liquidity is also provided by the maintenance of a base of core deposits, cash and non-interest-bearing deposits due from banks, the ability to sell or pledge marketable assets and access to lines of credit. At September 30, 2024, liquidity sources, which include cash and unencumbered securities and secured and unsecured funding capacity, totaled 637.1 million. Liquidity is continuously monitored, thereby allowing management to better understand and react to emerging balance sheet trends, including temporary mismatches with regard to sources and uses of funds. After assessing actual and projected cash flow needs, management seeks to obtain funding at the most economical cost. These funds can be obtained by converting liquid assets to cash or by attracting new deposits or other sources of funding. Many factors affect the Company s ability to meet liquidity needs, including variations in the markets served, loan demand, its asset/liability mix, its reputation and credit standing in its markets and general economic conditions. Borrowings and the scheduled amortization of investment securities and loans are more predictable funding sources. Deposit flows and securities prepayments are somewhat less predictable as they are often subject to external factors. Among these are changes in the local and national economies, competition from other financial institutions and changes in market interest rates. The Company s primary sources of funds are cash provided by deposits, which may include brokered and listing service deposits, borrowings, proceeds from maturities and sales of securities and cash provided by operating activities. At September 30, 2024, total deposits were 2.0 billion, of which 491.9 million were time deposits scheduled to mature within the next 12 months. Based on historical experience, the Company expects to be able to replace a substantial portion of those maturing deposits with comparable deposit products. Insured and collateralized deposits, which include municipal deposits, accounted for approximately 86 of total deposits at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 125.8 million and 129.0 million, respectively, in borrowings outstanding. The Liquidity and Wholesale Funding Policy of the Bank establishes specific policies and operating procedures governing liquidity levels to assist management in developing plans to address future and current liquidity needs. Management monitors the rates and cash flows from loan and investment portfolios while also examining the maturity structure and volatility characteristics of liabilities to develop an optimum asset/liability mix. Available funding sources include retail, commercial and municipal deposits, purchased liabilities and stockholders equity. Daily, management receives a current cash position update to ensure that all obligations are satisfied. On a weekly basis, appropriate senior management receives a current liquidity position report and a ninety day forecasted cash flow to ensure that all short-term obligations will be met and there is sufficient liquidity available. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had a total borrowing capacity of 692.0 million at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, of which 368.1 million was used to collateralize municipal deposits and 125.8 million was utilized for overnight and term advances. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had a 263.7 million collateralized line of credit from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York s discount window with no outstanding borrowings. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had access to approximately 92 million in unsecured lines of credit extended by correspondent banks, if needed, for short-term funding purposes. No borrowings were outstanding under lines of credit with correspondent banks at September 30, 2024. Our sources of wholesale funding included brokered certificates of deposit, listing service certificates of deposit and insured cash sweep ICS reciprocal deposits in excess of 20 of total liabilities, which balances totaled approximately 87.6 million, 4.4 million and 56.7 million, or 4.5 , 0.2 and 2.9 of total deposits, respectively, at September 30, 2024. We utilized brokered certificates of deposit and listing service certificates of deposit as alternatives to other forms of wholesale funding, including borrowings, when interest rates and market conditions favor the use of such deposits. For a portion of our brokered certificates of deposit, we utilized interest rate swap contracts to effectively extend their duration and to fix their cost.

 The Company strives to maintain an efficient level of capital, commensurate with its risk profile, on which a competitive rate of return to stockholders will be realized over the short and long terms. Capital is managed to enhance stockholder value while providing flexibility for management to act opportunistically in a changing marketplace. Management continually evaluates the Company s capital position in light of current and future growth objectives and regulatory guidelines. Total stockholders equity was 192.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 184.8 million at December 31, 2023. The 7.5 million increase was primarily due to an increase of 6.2 million in retained earnings and a decrease of 0.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in retained earnings was due primarily to net income of 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was offset by 2.2 million of dividends declared. The accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2024 was 1.1 of total equity and was comprised of a 1.0 million after tax net unrealized loss on the investment portfolio and a 1.1 million after tax net unrealized loss on derivatives. The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements. The Bank s tier 1 leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.85 , 12.99 , 12.99 and 14.24 , respectively, at September 30, 2024, exceeding all regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized institution, the highest regulatory capital category. Moreover, capital rules also place limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if a banking organization does not maintain a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum capital requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Bank s capital buffer was in excess of requirements. On October 5, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program. Under the new repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 366,050 shares of its common stock, or approximately 5 of its then outstanding shares. The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in the open market as conditions allow, or in privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company has not made any stock repurchases under the program. The remaining buyback authority under the share repurchase program therefore remained at 366,050 shares as of September 30, 2024. The Company s total stockholders equity to total assets ratio and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio TCE ratio were 8.26 and 7.49 , respectively, at September 30, 2024, versus 8.14 and 7.35 , respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 8.65 and 7.81 , respectively, at September 30, 2023. The TCE ratio is a non-GAAP ratio. The ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure to this non-GAAP ratio. The ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, or TCE ratio, is calculated by dividing total stockholders equity by total assets, after reducing both amounts by intangible assets. The TCE ratio is not required by U.S. GAAP or by applicable bank regulatory requirements, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of our capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Set forth below are the reconciliations of tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP total stockholders equity and tangible assets to U.S. GAAP total assets at September 30, 2024 (in thousands).

 All dividends must conform to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company s ability to pay dividends to stockholders depends on the Bank s ability to pay dividends to the Company. Additionally, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Under New York law, a bank may pay a dividend on its common stock only out of net profits, and must obtain the approval of the Superintendent of the DFS if the total of all dividends declared by a bank or trust company in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. The Company s Board of Directors approved the declaration of a 0.10 per share cash dividend on both common and Series A preferred shares payable on November 13, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 6, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements - The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers provided there are no violations of material conditions established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral required varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, real estate and income-producing commercial properties. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, commitments to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit for which the Bank is obligated amounted to approximately 123 million and 147 million, respectively. Letters of credit are conditional commitments guaranteeing payments of drafts in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit agreements. Commercial letters of credit are used primarily to facilitate trade or commerce and are also issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, bond financings and similar transactions. Collateral may be required to support letters of credit based upon management s evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, letters of credit outstanding were approximately 0.8 million and 3.9 million, respectively. Results of Operations Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The Company recorded net income of 3.5 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net interest income increased 1.3 million, non-interest income increased 0.2 million, provision for credit losses decreased 0.3 million and income tax expense decreased 0.1 million compared to the September 30, 2023 quarter. These were offset by an increase of 1.9 million in non-interest expenses, particularly salaries and employee benefits, resulting in flat earnings between these periods. Net Interest Income and Margin The 1.3 million increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the comparable 2023 quarter was due to improvement of the Company s net interest margin to 2.37 in the 2024 quarter from 2.29 in the comparable 2023 quarter. The yield on interest earning assets increased to 6.17 in the 2024 quarter from 5.61 in the comparable 2023 quarter, an increase of 56 basis points. This increase was partially offset by a 58 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 4.53 in 2024 from 3.95 in the third quarter of 2023. The following table, Net Interest Income Analysis , presents for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company s average assets, liabilities and stockholders equity. The Company s net interest income, net interest spread and net interest margin are also reflected.

(3) Net interest spread represents the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. (4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Provision and Allowance for Credit losses on Loans The Company recorded a 0.2 million provision for credit losses expense on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 0.5 million recorded for the comparable period in 2023. The allowance for credit losses increased by 3.7 million, or 19.1 , to 23.4 milion, or 1.17 of total loans at September 30, 2024, from 19.7 million, or 1.00 of total loans at December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans is attributable to an ACL on an individually evaluated loan of 2.5 million and 1.1 million related to ongoing enhancements to the CECL model during the June 2024 quarter. (See also Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates and Asset Quality contained herein.) Reserve for Unfunded Commitments The Company maintains a reserve, recorded in other liabilities, associated with unfunded loan commitments accepted by borrowers. The amount of the reserve was 0.3 million at September 30, 2024 and 0.1 million at December 31, 2023. This reserve is determined based upon the outstanding volume of loan commitments at each period end. Any increases or reductions in this reserve are recognized in provision for credit losses.

 Non-interest Income Non-interest income increased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable 2023 period. The Bank s investment in government guaranteed lending continues to yield results. This increase was driven by a 1.4 million increase in net gain on sale of loans reflecting the strengthening of secondary market premiums for sales of SBA loans. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold the government guaranteed portion of SBA loans totaling approximately 27.1 million and 18.4 million, respectively, recognizing net gain on sale of loans held for sale of 2.4 million and 1.5 million, respectively. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 16.5 million of residential loans under the flow origination program and recorded net gain on sale of loans held for sale of 0.4 million. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in other income, reflecting that in the September 30, 2023 quarter, the Company settled ongoing litigation and received a settlement payment of 1.0 million which was recorded in other income. Non-Interest Income For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

The increase in non-interest expense was primarily in salaries and employee benefits related to additional staff for the SBA, C I Banking and Operations teams and severance payments in August 2024 paid in connection with a loan personnel restructuring initiative.

 Results of Operations Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The Company recorded net income of 8.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus net income of 9.8 million in the comparable nine-month period a year ago. The decrease in earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable 2023 period resulted from a 2.6 million increase in the provision for credit losses expense and a 3.2 million increase in non-interest expense, which were partially offset by a 3.7 million increase in non-interest income, consisting primarily of gain on sale of loans held-for-sale, and a 0.7 million decrease in income tax expense. Net Interest Income and Margin Net interest income was 39.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a slight increase of 0.1 million from the comparable 2023 period. The Company s net interest margin was 2.41 in the 2024 nine month period from 2.65 in the comparable 2023 period. The yield on interest earning assets increased to 6.14 in the 2024 nine month period from 5.58 in the comparable 2023 period, an increase of 56 basis points. This increase was offset by a 95 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 4.45 in 2024 from 3.50 in the 2023 nine month period due to the rapid and significant rise in interest rates and the competitive deposit environment and, to a lesser extent, the Company s decision to increase liquidity as a result of the industry events over the last two years. Together, this resulted in the higher cost of funds.

 Provision for Credit Losses on Loans The Company recorded a 4.5 million provision for credit losses expense on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus 1.9 million recorded for the comparable period in 2023. The increase was related to matters discussed above under the comparison of results for the three-month period. (See also Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates and Asset Quality contained herein.) Non-interest Income Non-interest income increased by 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable 2023 period. This increase was driven by a 4.4 million increase in net gain on sale of loans reflecting the strengthening of secondary market premiums for sales of SBA loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold approximately 81.8 million and 43.8 million, respectively in the government guaranteed portion of SBA loans, recognizing net gains of 7.4 million and 3.5 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 19.4 million of residential loans under the flow origination program and recorded net gains of 0.5 million. Non-interest Expense Total non-interest expense increased by 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the comparable 2023 period. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily in salaries and employee benefits attributed to additional staff for the SBA, C I Banking and Operations teams. The Company recorded income tax expense of 8.4 million for an effective tax rate of 24.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus income tax expense of 3.5 million for an effective tax rate of 26.0 in the comparable 2023 period. Asset Quality - Total non-accrual loans at September 30, 2024 were 15.4 million, or 0.77 of total loans, compared to 14.5 million, or 0.74 of total loans at December 31, 2023 and 14.9 million, or 0.80 of total loans, at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans amounted to 152 , 136 and 98 at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Total loans having credit risk ratings of Special Mention and Substandard were 43.8 million at September 30, 2024, versus 42.4 million at December 31, 2023. The Company s Special Mention and Substandard loans were comprised of residential real estate, multi-family, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans (including SBA facilities) and construction and land development loans at September 30, 2024. The Company had no loans with a credit risk rating of Doubtful for the periods presented. All loans not having credit risk ratings of Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful are considered pass loans. At September 30, 2024, the Company s allowance for credit losses amounted to 23.4 million or 1.17 of period-end total loans outstanding. The allowance as a percentage of loans outstanding was 1.00 at December 31, 2023 and 0.78 at September 30, 2023. The Company recorded net loan charge-offs of 0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus net loan charge-offs of 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded a 0.2 million provision for credit losses expense on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus 0.5 million recorded for the comparable period in 2023. Additional information regarding the ACL and the associated provisions recognized during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented in Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.

 ITEM 3. - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company originates and invests in interest-earning assets and solicits interest-bearing deposit accounts. The Company s operations are subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates to the extent that there is a difference between the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that are prepaid, withdrawn, matured or repriced in any given period of time. The Company s earnings or the net value of its portfolio will change under different interest rate scenarios. The principal objective of the Company s asset/liability management program is to maximize net interest income within an acceptable range of overall risk, including both the effect of changes in interest rates and liquidity risk. The Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage interest rate risk including, but not limited to: (i) balancing the types and structures of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by diversifying mix, coupons, maturities and/or repricing characteristics, (ii) reducing the overall interest rate sensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing core and/or longer-term deposits; utilizing FHLB advances and wholesale deposits for our interest rate risk profile, and (iii) entering into interest rate swap agreements. The following presents the Company s economic value of equity EVE and net interest income NII sensitivities at September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). The results are within the Company s policy limits. 

At September 30, 2024 Interest Rates Estimated Estimated Change in EVE Interest Rates Estimated Estimated Change in NII (1) (basis points) EVE Amount (basis points) NII (1) Amount +200 142,354 (32,473) (18.6) +200 56,361 (5,986) (9.6) +100 159,631 (15,196) (8.7) +100 59,424 (2,923) (4.7) 0 174,827 0 62,347 -100 187,521 12,694 7.3 -100 65,628 3,281 5.3 -200 198,919 24,092 13.8 -200 68,507 6,160 9.9 -300 216,780 41,953 24.0 -300 70,900 8,553 13.7 

 (1) Assumes 12 month time horizon. Certain model limitations are inherent in the methodology used in the EVE and net interest income measurements. The models require the making of certain assumptions which may tend to oversimplify the way actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The models assume that the composition of the Company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured, thus they do not consider the Company s strategic plans, or any other steps it may take to respond to changes in rates over the forecasted period of time. Additionally, the models assume immediate changes in interest rates, based on yield curves as of a point-in-time, which are reflected in a parallel, instantaneous and uniform manner across all yield curves, when in reality changes may rarely be of this nature. The models also utilize data derived from historical performance and as interest rates change the actual performance of loan prepayments, rate sensitivities, and average life assumptions may deviate from assumptions utilized in the models and can impact the results. Accordingly, although the above measurements provide an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates. Given the speed with which interest rates may change, the projections noted above on the Company s EVE and net interest income can be expected to differ from actual results.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule l3a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in the Company s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PART II ITEM 1. - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is not subject to any legal proceedings, which could have a materially adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes to the risks disclosed in the Risk Factors section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On October 5, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program. Under the new repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 366,050 shares of its common stock, or approximately 5 of its then outstanding shares. The repurchase program permits shares to be repurchased in the open market as conditions allow, or in privately negotiated transactions, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company has not made any stock repurchases under the program. The remaining buyback authority under the share repurchase program therefore remained at 366,050 shares as of September 30, 2024. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES Not applicable. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION t p licable.
