 Derivative instruments 
 The company s size, strong capital structure and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the company s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates and interest rates. In addition, the company uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Consolidated statement of income on a net basis in the line "Revenues" and in the Consolidated statement of cash flows in "Cash flows from (used in) operating activities". The company s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. 
 Credit risk associated with the company s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. The company maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.

 Item 2. Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures and other specified financial measures 
 Certain measures included in this document are not prescribed by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These measures constitute "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, and "specified financial measures" under National Instrument 52-112 Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure of the Canadian Securities Administrators. 
 
 Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure, and other information required by these regulations, have been provided. Non-GAAP financial measures and specified financial measures are not standardized financial measures under GAAP and do not have a standardized definition. As such, these measures may not be directly comparable to measures presented by other companies, and should not be considered a substitute for GAAP financial measures. 
 Net income (loss) excluding identified items 
 Net income (loss) excluding identified items is a non-GAAP financial measure that is total net income (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least 100 million in a given quarter. The net income (loss) impact of an identified item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than 100 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. The most directly comparable financial measure that is disclosed in the financial statements is "Net income (loss)" within the company s Consolidated statement of income. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The company believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Net income (loss) excluding identified items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All identified items are presented on an after-tax basis. 
 Reconciliation of net income (loss) excluding identified items 
 There were no identified items in the third quarter or year-to-date 2024 and 2023 periods.

 Recent business environment 
 
 During the third quarter, crude prices decreased versus the second quarter, reflecting uncertainty about future China demand and OPEC+ supply. The Canadian WTI/WCS spread remained stable in the third quarter and narrowed versus the 2023 full-year average. Industry refining margins declined versus the second quarter as increased supply outpaced global demand.

 Price Average bitumen realizations increased by 6.90 per barrel, primarily driven by the narrowing WTI/WCS spread, lower diluent costs, and higher marker prices.

 12.4 17.5 (a) Share repurchases were made under and in connection with the company's normal course issuer bid program, and include shares purchased from Exxon Mobil Corporation. 

On June 24, 2024, the company announced by news release that it had received final approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange for a new normal course issuer bid and will continue its existing share purchase program. The program enables the company to purchase up to a maximum of 26,791,840 common shares during the period June 29, 2024 to June 28, 2025. This maximum includes shares purchased under the normal course issuer bid from Exxon Mobil Corporation. As in the past, Exxon Mobil Corporation has advised the company that it intends to participate to maintain its ownership percentage at approximately 69.6 percent. The program will end should the company purchase the maximum allowable number of shares or otherwise on June 28, 2025. Imperial plans to accelerate its share purchases under the normal course issuer bid program, and anticipates repurchasing all remaining allowable shares prior to year end. Purchase plans may be modified at any time without prior notice. 
 
 As previously communicated, in June 2024, the company extended the maturity date of its existing long-term, variable-rate, Canadian dollar loan from ExxonMobil to June 30, 2035. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. 
 Contractual obligations 
 
 As previously communicated, in the first quarter of 2024, the company entered into a long-term purchase agreement with a third party for about 2 billion. It has no material impact on the 2024 and 2025 obligations disclosed in Imperial's 2023 annual report on Form 10-K. The company does not believe that the additional obligation will have a material effect on Imperial's operations, financial condition or financial statements.

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED 

 board of directors think adequate and upon such other conditions as the board of directors may think fit, permit the person claiming to be entitled thereto or his or her nominee to be registered as the shareholder in respect of the shares specified in the said share warrant as if the same had been surrendered in accordance with the provisions of subclause (a) of this clause. 
 (e) No person as holder or bearer of a share warrant or coupon shall be entitled to receive any dividends unless and until he or she shall surrender such warrant or the warrant to which the coupon belonged, as the case may be, and be registered as a shareholder under the provisions of subclause (a) of this clause. Within 30 days of registration as a shareholder of the shares specified in the said share warrant, the shareholder shall be entitled to all dividends declared but unpaid on such shares. 
 (f) No person as a holder or bearer of a share warrant shall be entitled in respect thereto to receive notice of or attend or vote or exercise any of the rights of a shareholder at any meeting of the shareholders of the corporation or participate in the requisitioning of any meeting of shareholders.

In the case of joint shareholders any cheque shall, unless such joint shareholders in writing otherwise direct, be made payable to the order of all such joint shareholders and if more than one address is recorded on the securities registers of the corporation in respect of such joint holding, any cheque shall be mailed to the first address so recorded, unless such joint holders otherwise direct.

In the event of non-receipt of any dividend cheque by the person to whom it is so sent as aforesaid, the corporation may issue to such person a replacement cheque for a like amount upon such terms as to indemnity and evidence of non-receipt as the board of directors may from time to time prescribe, whether generally or in any particular case.
