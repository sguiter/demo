The new guidance requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of the financial statements to understand the program s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2023, except for the amendment on roll forward information which was adopted January 1, 2024. As the guidance requires only additional disclosure, there were no effects of this standard on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 We expect to complete the transition to the new organizational structure by the end of 2024, and the transformation initiative is expected to be completed by the end of 2026, with total costs anticipated to be approximately billion pre-tax. Cash costs are expected to be approximately half of that amount, primarily related to workforce reductions. Expected non-cash charges are primarily related to incremental depreciation and asset write-offs, including losses associated with the expected exit of certain markets.

 . We previously accounted for our ownership interest in Thinx as an equity method investment, but upon increasing our ownership to , we began consolidating the operations of Thinx into our condensed consolidated financial statements at the end of the first quarter of 2022. 
 In the first quarter of 2023, we delivered a redemption notice to the third-party minority owner with respect to a portion of the remaining common securities of Thinx. The redemption closed in the second quarter of 2023, and we acquired additional ownership of Thinx for , increasing our controlling ownership to . As part of the completion of a negotiated final redemption, we acquired the remaining ownership of Thinx for in the fourth quarter of 2023. As the purchase of additional ownership in an already controlled subsidiary represents an equity transaction, no gain or loss was recognized in consolidated net income or comprehensive income. 
 Divestitures 
 On July 1, 2024, we completed the sale transaction that was announced on April 7, 2024, of the personal protective equipment ("PPE") business included in our K-C Professional business segment for total consideration of , including the initial purchase price of less working capital and other closing adjustments of . The transaction included Kimtech branded products, such as gloves, apparel and masks, and KleenGuard branded products, such as gloves, apparel, respirators and eyewear, which serve a variety of scientific and industrial industries globally. Upon closure of the transaction, a pre-tax gain of after-tax) was recognized in Other (income) and expense, net. This gain is net of transaction costs of that were determined to be directly attributable to the sale transaction. 
 On June 1, 2023, we completed the sale transaction, announced on October 24, 2022, of our Neve tissue brand and related consumer and K-C Professional tissue assets in Brazil for . Upon closure of the transaction, a gain of pre-tax was recognized in Other (income) and expense, net. We incurred divestiture-related costs of pre-tax, which were recorded in Cost of products sold and Marketing, research and general expenses, resulting in a net benefit of pre-tax after-tax).

 pre-tax after-tax) to write-down these intangible assets to their respective fair values. The valuation methods used in the assessments included the relief from royalty and distributor relationships methods. These impairment charges were primarily caused by increased attrition in our distributor relationships valuation model and the continued challenges arising from modified consumer shopping behavior in the post-COVID-19 period coupled with revisions to our long-term strategy and outlook. These noncash charges were included in Impairment of intangible assets in our condensed consolidated statements of income and in Asset impairments within Operating Activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 We believe our estimates and assumptions used in the valuations are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other market participants; however, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in the valuation, and to the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the projected cash flows used to estimate fair value, additional noncash impairment charges could be required in the future. 
 2023 Intangible Asset Impairment 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we conducted forecasting and strategic reviews and integration assessments of our Softex Indonesia business, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020, and with performance below expectations since acquisition, we revised internal financial projections of the business to reflect updated expectations of future financial performance. As a result of separate management reviews, we also have revised internal financial projections associated with our acquisition of a controlling interest in Thinx as a result of performance below expectations. 
 These revisions were considered triggering events requiring interim impairment assessments to be performed relative to the intangible assets that had been recorded as part of these acquisitions. These intangible assets were recorded as part of the Personal Care business segment and included indefinite-lived and finite-lived brands and finite-lived distributor and customer relationships. As a result of the interim impairment assessments, we recognized impairment charges, principally arising from the impairment charge of related to the Softex business, totaling pre-tax after-tax) to write-down these intangible assets to their respective fair values aggregating to as of June 30, 2023.

and , respectively, and derivative liabilities were and , respectively. The fair values of derivatives used to manage interest rate risk and commodity price risk are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") and interest rate swap curves and on commodity price quotations, respectively. The fair values of hedging instruments used to manage foreign currency risk are based on published quotations of spot currency rates and forward points, which are converted into implied forward currency rates. Measurement of our derivative assets and liabilities is considered a level 2 measurement. Additional information on our classification and use of derivative instruments is contained in Note 8. 
 Redeemable preferred securities of subsidiaries are measured on a recurring basis at their estimated redemption values, which approximate fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the securities were valued at . The securities are not traded in active markets, and their measurement is considered a level 3 measurement.

Derivative assets are recorded in Other current assets or Other Assets, as appropriate, and derivative liabilities are recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities or Other Liabilities, as appropriate. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Translation adjustments result from translating foreign entities' financial statements into U.S. dollars from their functional currencies. The risk to any particular entity's net assets is reduced to the extent that the entity is financed with local currency borrowings. A portion of our balance sheet translation exposure for certain affiliates, which results from changes in translation rates between the affiliates functional currencies and the U.S. dollar, is hedged with cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt which are designated as net investment hedges. The foreign currency exposure on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany loans and accounts payable, is hedged with primarily undesignated derivative instruments. 
 Derivative instruments are entered into to hedge a portion of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies for non-U.S. operations' purchases of raw materials, which are priced in U.S. dollars, and imports of intercompany finished goods and work-in-process priced predominantly in U.S. dollars and euros. The derivative instruments used to manage these exposures are designated as cash flow hedges. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is managed using a portfolio of variable and fixed-rate debt composed of short and long-term instruments. Interest rate swap contracts may be used to facilitate the maintenance of the desired ratio of variable and fixed-rate debt and are designated as fair value hedges. From time to time, we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt, and these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We use derivative instruments, such as commodity forward and price swap contracts, to hedge a portion of our exposure to market risk arising from changes in prices of certain commodities. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of specific quantities of the underlying commodity expected to be purchased in future months. In addition, we utilize negotiated contracts of varying durations along with strategic pricing mechanisms to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 Derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are predominantly used to manage interest rate risk. The fair values of these interest rate derivative instruments are recorded as an asset or liability, as appropriate, with the offset recorded in Interest expense. The offset to the change in fair values of the related debt is also recorded in Interest expense. Any realized gain or loss on the derivatives that hedge interest rate risk is amortized to Interest expense over the life of the related debt. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate notional values and carrying values of debt subject to outstanding interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges were and , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, gains or losses recognized in Interest expense for interest rate swaps were not significant. 
 Cash Flow Hedges 
 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially recorded in AOCI, net of related income taxes, and recognized in earnings in the same income statement line and period that the hedged exposure affects earnings. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding commodity forward and price swap contracts were in place to hedge a portion of our estimated requirements of the related underlying commodities in the remainder of 2024 and future periods. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate notional value of outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges was billion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, no significant gains or losses were reclassified into Interest expense, Cost of products sold or Other (income) and expense, net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to the original forecasted transaction no longer being probable of occurring. 
 13 

. The maximum maturity of cash flow hedges in place as of September 30, 2024 is August 2027. 
 Net Investment Hedges 
 For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the aggregate notional value was billion as of September 30, 2024. We exclude the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts and the forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts from the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness. We recognize the interest accruals on cross-currency swap contracts in earnings within Interest expense. We amortize the forward points on foreign exchange contracts into earnings within Interest expense over the life of the hedging relationship. Changes in fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in AOCI and offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, unrealized gains of and , respectively, related to net investment hedge fair value changes were recorded in AOCI and no significant amounts were reclassified from AOCI to Interest expense. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, no significant amounts were excluded from the assessment of net investment, fair value or cash flow hedge effectiveness. 
 Undesignated Hedging Instruments 
 Gains or losses on undesignated foreign exchange hedging instruments are immediately recognized in Other (income) and expense, net. Gains of and losses of were recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gains of and losses of were recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effect on earnings from the use of these non-designated derivatives is substantially neutralized by the transactional gains and losses recorded on the underlying assets and liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the notional value of these undesignated derivative instruments was approximately billion.

 We have a supplier finance program managed through two global financial institutions under which we agree to pay the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices from our participating suppliers on the invoice due date. We, or the global financial institutions, may terminate our agreements at any time upon 30 days written notice. The global financial institutions may terminate our agreements at any time upon three days written notice in the event there are insufficient funds available for disbursement. We do not provide any forms of guarantees under these agreements. Supplier participation in the program is solely up to the supplier, and the participating suppliers negotiate their arrangements directly with the global financial institutions. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the program, and their participation has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due. The payment terms that we have with our suppliers under this program generally range from to days and are considered commercially reasonable. The outstanding amount related to the suppliers participating in this program was billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and was recorded within Trade accounts payable. 
 
 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Introduction 
 This management's discussion and analysis ("MD A") of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects. Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted. The following will be discussed and analyzed: 
 Overview of Third Quarter 2024 Results 
 Results of Operations and Related Information 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 We describe our business outside North America in two groups Developing and Emerging Markets ("D E") and Developed Markets. D E markets comprise Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, excluding Australia and South Korea. Developed Markets consist of Western and Central Europe, Australia and South Korea. We have three reportable business segments: Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional. These business segments are described in greater detail in Note 9 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. 
 On March 27, 2024, we announced the 2024 Transformation Initiative designed to sharpen our strategic focus through a new operating model that leverages three synergistic forces: 
 Accelerating pioneering innovation to capture significant growth available in our categories by investing in science and technology to satisfy unmet and evolving consumer needs, 
 Optimizing our margin structure to deliver superior consumer propositions and implement initiatives and deploy technology and data analytics designed to create a fast, adaptable, integrated supply chain with greater visibility that can deliver continuous improvement, and 
 Wiring our organization for growth to drive agility, speed, and focused execution that extends our competitive advantages further into the future. 
 16 

The 2024 Transformation Initiative is intended to improve our focus on growth and reduce our structural cost base by reorganizing into three new business segments, making the corporate and regional overhead cost structures more efficient and optimizing our global supply chain. The transformation is expected to impact our organization in all major geographies, and workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 4 to 5 . Certain actions under the transformation initiative are being finalized for implementation, and accounting for such actions will commence when the actions are authorized for execution. We expect to complete the transition to the new organizational structure by the end of 2024, and the transformation initiative is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. Total pre-tax savings are expected to be 3.0 billion in gross productivity; inclusive of input cost and manufacturing cost savings, and 200 in selling, general and administrative expenses. Total costs are anticipated to be approximately 1.5 billion pre-tax. Cash costs are expected to be approximately half of that amount, primarily related to workforce reductions. Expected non-cash charges are primarily related to incremental depreciation and asset write-offs, including losses associated with the expected exit of certain markets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total transformation initiative charges were 124 pre-tax 106 after-tax). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total transformation initiative charges were 359 pre-tax 257 after-tax). 
 On July 1, 2024, we completed the sale transaction that was announced on April 7, 2024, of the personal protective equipment ("PPE") business included in our K-C Professional business segment for total consideration of 635, including the initial purchase price of 640 less working capital and other closing adjustments of 5. The transaction included Kimtech branded products, such as gloves, apparel and masks, and KleenGuard branded products, such as gloves, apparel, respirators and eyewear, which serve a variety of scientific and industrial industries globally. Upon closure of the transaction, a pre-tax gain of 566 453 after-tax) was recognized in Other (income) and expense, net. This gain is net of transaction costs of 14 that were determined to be directly attributable to the sale transaction. 
 In February 24, 2022, we completed our acquisition of a majority and controlling share of Thinx Inc. Thinx ), an industry leader in the reusable period and incontinence underwear category, for total consideration of 181. In the first quarter of 2023, we delivered a redemption notice to the third-party minority owner with respect to a portion of the remaining common securities of Thinx. The redemption closed in the second quarter of 2023, and we acquired additional ownership of Thinx for 48, increasing our ownership to 70 . As part of the completion of a negotiated final redemption, we acquired the remaining 30 ownership of Thinx for 47 in the fourth quarter of 2023. As the purchase of additional ownership in an already controlled subsidiary represents an equity transaction, no gain or loss was recognized in consolidated net income or comprehensive income. 
 On June 1, 2023, we completed the sale transaction, announced on October 24, 2022, of our Neve tissue brand and related consumer and K-C Professional tissue assets in Brazil for 212. Upon closure of the transaction, a gain of 74 pre-tax was recognized in Other (income) and expense, net. We incurred divestiture-related costs of 30 pre-tax during the three months ended June 30, 2023, which were recorded in Cost of products sold and Marketing, research and general expenses, resulting in a net benefit of 44 pre-tax 26 after-tax). 
 Consistent with the humanitarian nature of our products, we manufacture and sell only essential items in Russia, such as baby diapers and feminine pads, which are critical to the health and hygiene of women, girls and babies. Beginning in March 2022, we significantly adjusted our business in Russia, substantially curtailing media, advertising and promotional activity and suspending capital investments, other than certain maintenance investments, in our sole manufacturing facility in Russia. Our Russia business has represented approximately 1 to 2 of our net global sales, operating profit and total assets. Our ability to continue our operations in Russia may change as the situation evolves. We have experienced high input costs, supply chain complexities, reduced consumer demand, restricted access to raw materials and production assets, and restricted access to financial institutions, as well as supply chain, professional services, monetary, currency, trade and payment/investment sanctions and related controls. As the business, geopolitical and regulatory environment concerning Russia evolves, we may not be able to sustain the limited manufacture and sale of our products, and our assets may be partially or fully impaired. 
 This section presents a discussion and analysis of our net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . In addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices excluding prior year's impact of divestitures and business exits on net sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and divestitures and business exits also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. Revenue growth management is used to describe our capability that helps optimize our consumer value proposition and thereby maximize our brands' revenue potential with consumer-centric insights. It focuses on strategic pricing decisions, price pack architecture, managing our product mix, trade promotion activity and trading

terms. Our analysis compares the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 results to the same periods in 2023. 
 Throughout this MD A, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. These measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted effective tax rate. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight into some of the financial measures used to evaluate management. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations to these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to the GAAP measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this MD A: 
 2024 Transformation Initiative - In 2024, we initiated this transformation initiative to improve our focus on growth and reduce our structural cost base by reorganizing into three new business segments, making the corporate and regional overhead cost structures more efficient and optimizing our global supply chain. Results in 2024 include charges related to this program. See Item 1, Note 2 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for details. 
 Sale of PPE business - In 2024, we recognized a gain related to the sale of our PPE business discussed above. See Item 1, Note 3 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for details. 
 Impairment of intangible assets - In the third quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023, we recognized charges related to the impairment of certain intangible assets related to Softex and Thinx. See Item 1, Note 4 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for details. 
 Sale of Brazil tissue and K-C Professional business - In the second quarter of 2023, we recognized a net benefit related to the sale of our Brazil tissue and K-C Professional business. See Item 1, Note 3 to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for details. 
 Pension settlements - In the second quarter of 2023, pension settlement charges were recognized related to lump-sum distributions from pension plan assets exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs resulting in a recognition of deferred actuarial losses. 
 The income tax effect of these non-GAAP items is calculated based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment. The impact of these non-GAAP items on the Company s effective tax rate represents the difference in the effective tax rate calculated with and without the non-GAAP adjustment on Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Interests and Provision for income taxes. 
 Overview of Third Quarter 2024 Results 
 Net sales of 5.0 billion decreased 4 compared to the prior year, while organic sales grew 1 . 
 Operating profit was 1.2 billion compared to 774 in the prior year. Net Income Attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation was 907 compared to 587 in the prior year, and diluted earnings per share were 2.69 compared to 1.73 in the prior year. Results in the current and prior year were impacted by the activities discussed in the non-GAAP section above.

 Consolidated net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 5.0 billion decreased 4 primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and the impacts from divestitures and business exits. Organic sales increased 1 due to higher net selling prices in hyperinflationary economies, mainly Argentina. 
 In North America, net sales decreased 3 primarily due to the divestiture of our PPE business and lower organic sales driven by reduced volume. Outside North America, net sales decreased 4 in D E markets as unfavorable currency impacts were partially offset by higher organic sales, while net sales decreased 4 in Developed Markets due to lower organic sales, unfavorable currency translation, and the impact of divestitures and business exits. Organic sales increased 8 in D E markets due to higher net selling prices in hyperinflationary economies, while Developed Markets decreased 2 primarily due to temporary energy surcharge-related price increases in the prior year, partially offset by volume and mix gains. 
 Consolidated net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 15.1 billion decreased 2 compared to the prior year. Organic sales increased 4 , as changes in net selling prices, product mix, and volume increased sales by 2 , 1 , and 1 , respectively. The increase in net selling prices was driven by hyperinflationary economies, mainly Argentina. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately 4 , while divestitures and business exits decreased sales by 1 . In North America, net sales were flat as higher organic sales were offset by the divestiture of our PPE business. Changes in net and organic sales for D E Markets and Developed Markets were relatively consistent with those discussed for the quarter-to-date period above. 
 Operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.2 billion and 2.7 billion, respectively, compared to 774 and 1.7 billion for the prior year. Results in 2024 include charges related to the 2024 Transformation Initiative, the gain recognized for the sale of the PPE business, and charges related to the impairment of intangible assets, compared to 2023 results which include the net benefit related to the sale of the Brazil tissue and K-C Professional business and charges related to the impairment of intangible assets. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 810 and 2.6 billion, respectively, representing a 5 and 12 increase compared to the prior year. Results benefited from gross supply chain productivity savings of approximately 130 and 385, respectively, partially offset by supply chain

related investments, input cost inflation, primarily in D E markets, unfavorable currency effects and the impact of divestitures. 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 67 and 206, respectively, compared to 74 and 223 for the prior year. 
 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.5 and 20.2 , respectively, compared to 22.5 and 21.2 for the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 22.7 and 22.4 , respectively, compared to 22.5 and 22.6 for the prior year. 
 Our share of net income of equity companies for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 48 and 172, respectively, compared to 50 and 143 for the prior year. The changes for the nine months ended were driven by Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. results which benefited from volume, mix and pricing growth, productivity savings, and favorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. 
 Diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.69 and 6.21, respectively, compared to 1.73 and 3.70 for the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.83 and 5.80, respectively, representing a 5 and 15 increase compared to the prior year.

 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 2.6 billion decreased 2 as unfavorable currency impacts of 6 were partially offset by a 3 increase in organic sales. The increase in organic sales was driven by changes in net selling prices and product mix gains of 3 and 1 , respectively. The increase in net selling prices was driven by hyperinflationary economies, mainly Argentina. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 8.0 billion decreased 1 as unfavorable currency impacts were largely offset by growth in organic sales. Organic sales growth benefited from higher net selling prices in hyperinflationary economies coupled with increased volume within North America and D E markets. 
 Operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 482 decreased 4 compared to the prior year as pricing net of inflation and gross supply chain productivity savings were more than offset by unfavorable currency effects and higher advertising investments. Both pricing and the impacts of currency were primarily driven by hyperinflationary economies. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.6 billion increased 7 compared to the prior year. Results benefited primarily from favorable volume and mix, pricing net of inflation and gross supply chain productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects and higher marketing, research and general expenses.

 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 1.5 billion decreased 2 primarily due to a 1 decline in organic sales. Organic sales were negatively impacted by retailer inventory volume adjustments in North America and lower pricing in Developed Markets due to temporary energy surcharge-related price increases in the prior year. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.6 billion decreased 3 due to impacts from divestitures and business exits, coupled with a decline in organic sales from lower pricing in Developed Markets. 
 Operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 265 decreased 1 compared to the prior year as productivity savings were offset by unfavorable pricing net of inflation and higher manufacturing costs. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 800 increased 13 compared to the prior year. Results benefited from productivity savings and more balanced pricing relative to input costs.

 (e) Impact of the sale of the Brazil tissue and K-C Professional business, sale of the PPE business and other exited businesses and markets in conjunction with the 2024 Transformation Initiative. 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 767 decreased 10 primarily due to divestitures and business exits and unfavorable currency impacts. Organic sales declined 1 primarily from the impacts of lower pricing in Developed Markets due to temporary energy surcharge-related price increases in the prior year and decreased volume in North America due to softer demand in retail and industrial channels. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 2.4 billion decreased 6 primarily due to divestitures and business exits and unfavorable currency impacts. Organic sales were flat to the prior year as favorable mix gains were offset by lower volume in North America. 
 Operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 161 decreased 4 compared to the prior year primarily due to the divestiture of the PPE business and unfavorable pricing net of cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains. Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 535 increased 4 compared to the prior year. Results primarily benefited from productivity savings, partially offset by the divestiture of the PPE business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Provided by Operations 
 Cash provided by operations was 2.4 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.3 billion in the prior year. The increase was driven by the higher operating profit, excluding the effect of non-cash charges, and favorable changes in operating working capital, partially offset by cash payments related to our 2024 Transformation Initiative. 
 Investing 
 Cash provided by investing was 94 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in the prior year of 266, as capital spending was more than offset by proceeds from asset and business dispositions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our capital spending was 512 compared to 549 in the prior year. We anticipate that full year capital spending will be approximately 800, including incremental spending from the 2024 Transformation Initiative. Proceeds from asset and business dispositions of 649 in the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflected the sale of our PPE business. Proceeds from asset and business dispositions of 219 in the first nine months of 2023 primarily reflected the sale of our Brazil tissue and K-C Professional business. 
 Financing 
 Cash used for financing was 2.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.6 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased share repurchases coupled with debt repayments during the current year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we re purchased 5.4 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our publicly announced share repurchase programs at a total cost of 752 throu gh a b roker in the open market. 
 Our short-term debt, which consists of U.S. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-U.S. subsidiaries, was 4 as of September 30, 2024 (included in Debt payable within one year on the condensed consolidated balance sheet). The average month-end balance of short-term debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5. These short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding to support our operations. The level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as dividends and income taxes. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total debt was 7.5 billion and 8.0 billion, respectively. 
 We maintain a 2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2028 and a 750 revolving credit facility which expires in May 2025. These facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason. 
 We have evaluated the effects of the Global anti-Base Erosion rules set forth by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, referred to as Pillar 2, which establishes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 . We have (1) determined that Pillar 2 legislation has been enacted in one or more of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates and the Company is within the scope of such legislation, (2) assessed such enacted legislation and, as applicable, the Transitional Safe Harbor provisions for Pillar 2 that apply, and (3) determined the impact will be immaterial to our financial results. We intend to file a Qualified Country-by-Country Report for the current year for each jurisdiction in which we intend to rely on the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbor provisions. 
 We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, payments for our 2024 Transformation Initiative, capital spending, pension contributions, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future. Further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future. 
 Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook, including raw material, energy and other input costs, the anticipated charges and savings from the 2024 Transformation Initiative, cash flow and uses of cash, growth initiatives, innovations, marketing and other spending, net sales, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including the impact in Argentina and T rkiye, effective tax rate, contingencies and anticipated transactions of Kimberly-Clark, including dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are 
 26 

based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting Kimberly-Clark. There can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them. 
 The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside our control, including the risk that we are not able to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2024 Transformation Initiative (including risks related to disruptions to our business or operations or related to any delays in implementation), war in Ukraine (including the related responses of consumers, customers, and suppliers and sanctions issued by the U.S., the European Union, Russia or other countries), pandemics, epidemics, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the prices and availability of our raw materials, supply chain disruptions, disruptions in the capital and credit markets, counterparty defaults (including customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which we do business), failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies from our acquisition and disposition activity, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and our projections of operating results and other factors that may affect our impairment testing, changes in customer preferences, severe weather conditions, regional instabilities and hostilities (including the war in Israel), government trade or similar regulatory actions, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, as well as our ability to maintain key customer relationships, could affect the realization of these estimates. 
 The factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or in our other SEC filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
