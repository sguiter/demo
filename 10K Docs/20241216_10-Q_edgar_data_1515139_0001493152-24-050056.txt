Going
Concern 

These
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will
be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company
has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of and as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred net losses of and 
respectively. Further losses are anticipated as the Company s peruses new service business opportunities, this raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and
repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations, when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over
the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and proceeds from the issuance of its stock. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.

allowance for doubtful accounts at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Management individually reviews
accounts receivable balances and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness, estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that
may not be collected and would directly write off these balances. Management considers several factors, including the age of the receivables,
current economic conditions and other information management obtains regarding the financial condition of customers. The policy for determining
the past due status is based on the contractual payment terms of each customer. If conditions are identified that pose significant risk
of non-collections the determination to directly write off uncollectible receivables is made.

exercisable to shares of common stock. At December 31, 2023 the Company had convertible debt outstanding, warrants exercisable
to shares of common stock and stock options exercisable to shares of common stock. For both periods the effect
of exercisable options and warrants is anti-dilutive and they have been excluded from dilutive EPS.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT D) 

The
Company s financial instruments consist of equity investments, note receivables, derivative liabilities and notes payable. The
Company s note receivables were indirectly written down to zero due to potential non-collections. The Company s derivative
liabilities have a fair value of zero principally due to a decline in the stock price. These instruments are in level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy. 

When
determining fair value, whenever possible, the Company uses observable market data, and relies on unobservable inputs only when observable
market data is not available. As at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any level 1 or 2 financial instruments.
At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company s level 3 financial instruments were derivative liabilities for warrants
issued and outstanding that were not indexed to the Company s stock, notes payable and notes receivable valued at their present
values and equity investments in other entities.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT D) 

Some
of the warrants issued by the Company have strike prices denominated in Canadian dollars CAD ). The Company s functional
currency is USD. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 815 and EITF Issue No. 07-5, when the strike price of warrants is denominated in a
currency other than an entity s functional currency, the warrants would not be considered indexed to the entity s own stock
and would consequently be evaluated for a derivative liability under the conditions that the strike price is indexed to a foreign currency.
The derivative liability associated with these warrants was valued on the date of issuance and is revalued at each reporting period.
Due to the stock price on the report date, the derivative liability was valued at on Septemebr 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Warrants issued in CAD expired during 2023 therefore no derivatives are required at September 30, 2024 or December
31, 2023.

Consulting
Services 

Consulting
Service revenue is derived from providing professional knowledge and skills for creation of digital assets platforms and advisory services
to third-party customers. The contract and performance obligations are created based on the needs of the customer and the abilities of
the Company to provide the required services. The allocation of the transaction price to the individual performance obligations in the
contract may be specified by task or by phase depending on the work being done. Revenue is recognized upon completion of the performance
obligations. Revenues from ongoing services are recognized ratably over the related period. Revenue is recognized for the creation of
software and web-based platforms upon completion and delivery. There are various tasks associated with providing this service for which
customers are charged, nevertheless, no single task has a standalone fair value and each task is only valuable to the customer when the
project s objective is accomplished. Therefore, consulting services are considered a single revenue stream requiring all related
tasks to accomplish a specified customer objective. 

NFT
Revenue 

NFT
revenue is derived from the sale of NFTs. These NFTs are created by the Company s subsidiaries and are sold through an online sales
platform or through an auction. Revenue is recognized when the Company transfers the ownership of the NFT to the customer. 

Movie
Distribution Revenue 

Movie
distribution revenue is derived from the use of the Company s intangible assets. Revenues earned to date are from nonrefundable
minimum guaranteed payments recognized on the date distribution rights were granted to the purchaser and royalty revenues when certain
cost recuperation thresholds and other contractual conditions are met. Future revenues may be recognized from revenue generated by the
purchaser or by additional distribution sales over the term of the movie rights license. 

Funds
received for unearned revenue are deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and are recognized as revenue upon completion of
milestones or specified tasks.

Results
of Operations 

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

We
recognized no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized total
revenues of 530,082, with 5,082 coming from the sale of NFTs, 405,000 from consulting services and 120,000 in movie distribution
rights. 

Operating
Expenses 

We
incurred general and administrative expenses of 1,105,884 and 2,270,276 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
representing an decrease of 1,164,392 between the two periods. These expenses consisted primarily of stock-based compensation expenses
for issuance of options, consulting fees, pre-licensing fees, professional fees, and other general and administrative costs. The decrease
in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to the reduction in current project work. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income includes 82,627 note interest revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 154,973 note interest revenue. Other
expenses were 77,548 and 4,603 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting of interest expense
from the loan payable.

Net
Loss from Operations 

We
incurred net losses from operations of 2,737,682 and 1,589,824 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
representing a net change of 1,147,858, primarily attributable to the factors discussed above under the headings Revenue 
and Operating Expenses .

Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 478,094 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash used of 277,523
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 200,571. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was
primarily due to reduction in operating activities. 

Investing
Activities 

There
were no investing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

27 

Financing
Activities 

Financing
activities provided cash of 475,730 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 255,458 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, a decrease of 220,272. This decrease is mainly due to less share and convertible note issuance during the six months ended September
30, 2024. 

Cash
Requirements 

We
expect that we will require 1,200,000, including our current working capital, to fund our operating expenditures for the next twelve
months. Projected working capital requirements for the next twelve months are as follows: 

Estimated
Working Capital Expenditures During the Next Twelve Months 

General
 and administrative expenses 

1,200,000 

Total 

1,200,000 

Our
estimated general and administrative expenses for the next 12 months are 1,200,000 and are comprised of consulting fees, accounting
services, board of directors and advisory board fees, investor relations consultants, public relations and marketing consultants; legal
and professional fees (including auditing fees); for insurance; marketing and advertising expenses; trade shows; travel expenses; office
rent and miscellaneous and office expenses. 

We
will require additional cash resources to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12
months. We expect to derive such cash through the sale of equity or debt securities or by obtaining a credit facility. The sale of
additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in debt service
obligations, could cause additional dilution to our stockholders, and could require us to agree to financial covenants that could
restrict our operations or modify our plans to source a new business opportunity. Financing may not be available in amounts or on
terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to raise additional funds could cause cast doubt on the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

Going
Concern 

Our
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal
course of business. We have not yet established a source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and to allow us to continue
as a going concern. We have incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of 49,815,952 as of September 30, 2024
(December 31, 2023: 47,078,270). Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating
losses until we become profitable. 

In
their reports on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our current independent registered public accounting
firms included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to
provide the information under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our principal
executive officer, who is our president, and our principal financial officer, who is our chief financial officer, are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company. 

Our
management conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer
and our principal financial officer concluded that as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

On
July 31, 2024, LarCo Holdings, LLC LarCo filed a joint complaint against BIG, MetaWorks in the Superior Court of the
State of Arizona, Maricopa County, claiming damages in the amount of 1,321,382 of which MetaWorks is to pay 752,500 as a partial
settlement of this amount relating to an uncollected invoice. The claim also discloses MetaWork s contingent commitment to
settle a portion of this loan if any amount is collected from a specific uncollected customer invoice. The Company
intends to file a motion to dismiss this claim against it, as it has never been collected on the specified invoice, and the
Company s agreement for partial payment of this loan was solely dependent on collecting this customer balance. Management
determined with the advice of legal counsel that it is too early to estimate the outcome of this claim. 

In addition, we do not know of any such proceedings contemplated by any governmental authorities. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS.
