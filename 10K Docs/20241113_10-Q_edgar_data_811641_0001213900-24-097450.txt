of these assets are being depreciated over
 years. We began depreciating the leasehold improvements to our new First Defense production facility at 175
Industrial Way Building 175A over the remainder of the -year lease term beginning when a Certificate of Occupancy was issued
during the second quarter of 2020. During August of 2022, this lease term was extended to January of 2043 in connection with a new lease
covering additional space at 175 Industrial Way Building 175B ). As a result, the net book value of these leasehold improvements
as of August 31, 2022 is now being depreciated over the remainder of the extended lease term. Significant repairs to property, plant and
equipment that benefit more than a current period are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives. Insignificant repairs are expensed
when incurred. See Notes 2(h) and 7 for additional information.

, which was comprised of a mortgage
note (Loan #1) that bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum (with a -year term and 25-year amortization schedule and a balloon
principal payment of due during the first quarter of 2030) and a note (Loan #2) that bears interest at a fixed rate
of per annum (with a 7-year term and amortization schedule). The proceeds from the 2020 debt refinancing were used to repay all
bank debt outstanding at the time of closing and to provide some additional working capital. During the first quarter of 2022, we closed
on an additional in mortgage debt, which bears interest at the fixed rate of per annum. This was accomplished through
an amendment of the original mortgage note (Loan #1) that increased the then outstanding principal balance from to 
bearing interest at the blended fixed rate of per annum. This increased the balloon payment from to and extended
the due date of the balloon payment from the first quarter of 2030 to the first quarter of 2032. 

Line of Credit (LOC) : Also during the first
quarter of 2020, GSB extended a LOC to us that is available, as needed, through September 11, 2025. Interest on borrowings
against the LOC is variable at the National Prime Rate per annum. There was no outstanding balance under this LOC as of September 30,
2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Loan #3 : During the second quarter of 2020,
we received a loan from the Maine Technology Institute (MTI) in the aggregate principal amount of . The first years of this
loan were interest-free with no interest accrual or required principal payments. Beginning during the fourth quarter of 2022, Loan #3
became subject to quarterly principal and interest payments at a fixed rate of per annum over the final of the loan, through
the third quarter of 2027 if not repaid before then. 

Loan #4 : During the fourth quarter of 2020,
we closed on a note with GSB that bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum (with a -year term and amortization schedule).
Proceeds of were used to prepay a portion of the outstanding principal on our mortgage note (Loan #1), which reduced the outstanding
balance to of the most recent appraised value of the property securing the debt, which allowed GSB to release the that
had been held in escrow. The remaining proceeds were available for general working capital purposes. 

Loan #5 : On June 30, 2021, we executed definitive
agreements covering a second loan from the MTI in the aggregate principal amount of , proceeds from which were received in July
of 2021. The first two years of this loan were interest-free with no interest accrual or required principal payments. Principal and interest
payments at a fixed rate of per annum are due quarterly over the final years of the loan, beginning during the third quarter of
2023 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2028 if not repaid before then. 

Loan #6: During the third quarter of 2023,
we closed on a term loan bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum from GSB. The Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) provided
 of loan insurance to GSB. This loan is repayable under a -year amortization schedule with a balloon payment of 
due during the third quarter of 2026. 

Loan #7: Also during the third quarter of
2023, we closed on a term loan bearing interest at a fixed rate of per annum from FAME. The loan is repayable under a -year
amortization schedule with a balloon payment of due during the third quarter of 2026. 

Loans #1, #2, #4, #6 and #7 are secured by liens
on substantially all of our assets and are subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants. Loan #7 is subordinated to Loans #1,
#2, #4 and #6. Reflecting our poor financial performance during 2023 and into the first nine months of 2024, the debt service covenant
(DSC) requirements for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024 were
waived pre-emptively by our lenders. We are required to meet a minimum DSC ratio of for the year ending December 31, 2025 and annually
thereafter. In connection with these credit facilities, we incurred aggregate debt issuance and debt discount costs of 
and of which was incurred during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively). The amortization of these
debt issuance and debt discount costs is being recorded as a component of interest expense, included in other expenses, net, and is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the underlying terms of the notes. Loans #3 and #5 are unsecured and subordinated to our indebtedness
to GSB and FAME. Failure to make timely payments of principal and interest, or otherwise to comply with the terms of the agreements of
Loans #3 and #5, would entitle the MTI to accelerate the maturity of such debt and demand repayment in full. These loans may be prepaid
without penalty at any time.

in January 2025). This deferred compensation payment vested as to on January 1, 2023 and an additional on January 1,
2024. An additional will vest on January 1, 2025, provided that Mr. Brigham is employed by the Company as of such date. The vested
amounts would be paid upon the earlier of January 31, 2025 or within thirty (30) days following his separation from the Company. As of
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on
the accompanying balance sheets. In addition, upon termination of Mr. Brigham s employment (a) by the Company other than for cause,
(b) due to death or disability or (c) by Mr. Brigham for good reason, in each case as described and defined in the Deferred Compensation
Agreement, the Company agrees to pay Mr. Brigham of his then current annual base salary and a lump sum payment equal to the employer
portion of the costs of continued health benefits for Mr. Brigham and his covered dependents for a twelve-month period following termination,
and certain equity incentive awards granted to Mr. Brigham would continue to vest following such termination in accordance with the terms
of the Deferred Compensation Agreement. 

Incentive
compensation agreements may be entered into with Mr. Brigham, Ms. Brockmann (our Vice President of Sales and Marketing) and Ms. Williams
(our Vice President of Manufacturing Operations) which, at times, allow these executives to earn incentive compensation if certain regulatory
and financial objectives are met during the year to which the agreement relates, as specified in their agreements. Amounts related to
these incentive compensation agreements are accrued over the period they are earned (when it is probable that the amounts will be earned)
based on our best estimate of the amounts expected to be earned. 

In
addition to the commitments discussed above, we had committed to increase our production capacity for the First Defense 
product line, to the purchase of inventory, related to the commercial manufacture of Re-Tain 
and to information technology services and other obligations as of September 30, 2024 .

square feet of office and warehouse space with a possession date of November 15, 2019 and a commencement
date of February 13, 2020. The property is located at 175 Industrial Way in Portland Building 175A ), which is a short distance
from our headquarters and manufacturing facility at 56 Evergreen Drive. We renovated this space to meet our needs in expanding our production
capacity for the First Defense product line. The original lease term was with a right to renew for a
second -year term and a right of first offer to purchase. At the time we entered into this lease, we were not reasonably assured that
we would exercise this renewal option in place of other real estate options. For that reason, a 10-year period was reflected in the right-of-use
(ROU) asset and lease liability on our balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2022, we committed to lease an additional square
feet of space at 175 Industrial Way Building 175B ), which is connected to the original space, over a -year term. The ROU asset
and lease liability for the committed space at Building 175B was recorded as of April 1, 2023 after construction of the building
shell was completed in accordance with the lease agreement. Monthly lease payments commenced as of August 1, 2023. In connection with
the lease commitment for space at Building 175B, the term of the original lease for Building 175A was extended by approximately
13 years. On November 14, 2023, June 11, 2024 and September 20, 2024, we amended this lease further to provide for certain tenant improvements
on the leased premises to be paid for by our landlord. These improvements will provide heat to an unfinished space, provide additional
warehouse space, and create a new primary shipping and receiving facility. As a result of these three amendments and in consideration
for the landlord agreeing to pay for the cost of those certain tenant improvements, we agreed to make additional rent payments of 
per month from November of 2023 through June of 2025 and a one-time additional rent payment of in July of 2025. Because of these
modifications to the lease payments, the ROU asset and lease liability associated with the space at Building 175B were remeasured
as of the modification dates. Our leases include variable non-lease components. Such payments primarily include common area maintenance
charges. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the operating lease ROU asset was and the operating lease liability was .
As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the operating lease ROU asset was and the operating lease liability was .
The calculated amount of the ROU asset and lease liability is impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used for
the present value of the minimum lease payments. We elected not to separate lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying
assets, and instead to account for them as a single lease component.

Stock Option Plans 

In June of 2010, our stockholders approved the 2010
Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, under which
employees and certain service providers may be granted options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at no less than
fair market value on the date of grant. At that time, shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan and
subsequently no additional shares have been reserved for the 2010 Plan. Vesting requirements are determined by the Compensation and Stock
Option Committee of the Board of Directors on a case-by-case basis. All options granted under the 2010 Plan expire no later than years

Common Stock Rights Plan 

In September of 1995, our Board of Directors adopted
a Common Stock Rights Plan (the Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one common share purchase right (a Right for each of the then outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from
the Company one share of common stock at an initial purchase price of per share, subject to adjustment. The description and terms
of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, as Rights Agent. 

Upon the Distribution Date, the holder of each Right
not owned by the Acquiring Person would be entitled to purchase common stock at a discount to the initial purchase price of per
share, effectively equal to one half of the market price of a share of common stock on the date the Acquiring Person becomes an Acquiring
Person. If, after the Distribution Date, the Company should consolidate or merge with any other entity and the Company were not the surviving
company, or, if the Company were the surviving company, all or part of the Company s common stock were changed or exchanged into
the securities of any other entity, or if more than of the Company s assets or earning power were sold, each Right would entitle
its holder to purchase, at the Rights then-current purchase price, a number of shares of the acquiring company s common stock
having a market value at that time equal to twice the Right s exercise price. 

At any time after a person or group becomes an Acquiring
Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of or more of the outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors of
the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which have become void), in whole or in part, at
an exchange ratio of one share of common stock per Right (subject to adjustment). At any time prior to 14 days following the date that
any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person (subject to extension by the Board of Directors), the Board of Directors of the Company
may redeem the then outstanding Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of per Right, subject to adjustment.

ImmuCell Corporation 

Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements (continued) 

. During the second quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors also voted to authorize an amendment to remove a provision that
prevented a new group of directors elected following the emergence of an Acquiring Person (an owner of more than of our stock) from
controlling the Rights Plan by maintaining exclusive authority over the Rights Plan with pre-existing directors. We did this because such
provisions have come to be viewed with disfavor by Delaware courts. Each time that we made such amendments we entered into amendments
to the Rights Agreement with the Rights Agent reflecting such extensions, threshold increases or provision changes. No other changes have
been made to the terms of the Rights or the Rights Plan. 

At various times over the years, our Board of
Directors, which has the authority to amend the Rights Plan, has voted to authorize amendments to the Rights Plan to extend the expiration
date of the Rights Plan. Our Board of Directors determined not to further extend the Rights Plan because these plans
are generally considered not to be stockholder friendly. With no further extension, the Rights Plan expired as of September 19, 2024. 

Authorized Common Stock 

At the June 14, 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders,
our stockholders voted to approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized

not expire and of which (if not utilized before then) and state net operating loss carryforwards
of that (if not utilized before then). Additionally, we had federal general business tax credit
carryforwards of that (if not utilized before then) and state tax credit carryforwards of 
that (if not utilized before then). 

The provision for income taxes is determined using
the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax
effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
During the second quarter of 2018, we assessed our historical and near-term future profitability and recorded in non-cash income
tax expense to create a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets (which consist largely of net operating loss carryforwards
and federal and state credits) based on applicable accounting standards and practices. At that time, we had incurred a net loss for six
consecutive quarters, had not been profitable on a year-to-date basis since the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017 and projected
additional net losses for some period going forward before returning to profitability. Should future profitability be realized at an adequate
level, we would be able to release this valuation allowance (resulting in a non-cash income tax benefit) and realize these deferred tax
assets before they expire. We will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each quarter and, in the event that actual
results differ from these estimates, or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust our valuation allowance. Currently,
we adjust the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter to reduce the value of our deferred tax assets to .

The Scours segment consists of the First Defense product line. The core technology underlying the Scours segment
is focused on polyclonal antibodies. The Mastitis segment includes our products, CMT and Re-Tain . Re-Tain 
 is projected to be the driver of this segment when approved for sale. The core technology underlying the Mastitis segment is
focused on a bacteriocin called Nisin. The category we define as Other includes unallocated administrative and overhead
expenses and other products. The significant accounting policies of these segments are described in Note 2. Product sales are the primary
factor we use in determining our reportable segments. The governing regulatory authority (Center for Veterinary Biologics, U.S. Department
of Agriculture for First Defense or Center for Veterinary Medicine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Re-Tain is also a factor in determining our reportable segments. Management monitors and evaluates segment performance from sales to net operating
income (loss) closely. We are not organized by geographic region. No segments have been aggregated. The revenues and expenses allocated
to each segment are in some cases direct and in other cases involve reasonable and consistent estimations by management. Each operating

ITEM
2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

We
focus on the two most critical stages of dairy productivity, those being the first 30 days of life and the first 30 days of lactation.
Our concentrated colostrum and purified Nisin technologies offer unique animal health solutions during these periods when immunity is
at its most vulnerable. Both of our product lines present immediate growth opportunities and, in the future, may potentially be applied
in the human health sector, alongside the animal health sector that we currently serve. The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited financial statements and the related notes and
other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report). Some of the information contained in this
discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

We
are fortunate to be experiencing strong customer demand for the First
Defense product line, but the significant investments in facilities, equipment and staffing
necessary to double our production capacity have been challenging. Despite delays in the installation of certain equipment, we completed
these capacity-expanding investments around the end of 2022. In late 2022, we began experiencing production contamination events that
became more frequent during 2023 and continued through April of 2024. In July of 2023, we secured 3 million in debt financing to help
offset some of the lost sales and gross margin resulting from the slowdown implemented to mitigate the contamination events. With newly
implemented controls in place, we now believe that we have successfully remediated the issues underlying these contamination events.
Our next challenge is to resume our past production yields and achieve our gross margin goals of 35 to 40 , in comparison to the 27 
that we recorded during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. We believe that by both remediating the contamination events
and optimizing the operation of the new equipment installed to increase production output, we can improve process yields beginning during
the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025. We do not see one smoking gun as the root cause to the contamination and yield
losses. We think the solution is more about optimizing and controlling critical process parameters and multiple production inputs and
process steps. Concurrently, we are reducing product development expenses as we await approval of Re-Tain by
the Center for Veterinary Medicine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After an investment of about 25 years and approximately
 50 million in the development of this technology, we are committed to seeing this product through to regulatory approval and our previously
disclosed limited distribution, controlled launch strategy (Controlled Launch). At the same time, we are also in the very early stages
of exploring potential strategic partnerships that could offset some of our product development expenses and enhance a mass-market launch
of Re-Tain . We have decided that some stockholder ownership dilution is a necessary
cost to incur in order to improve our cash position. To that end, our at the market offering pursuant to the At-The-Market Offering Agreement
(ATM Agreement) has contributed meaningfully to our capital needs during 2024, as we stabilize our production systems at a higher output
level. 

Net
cash provided by operating activities was 361,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 in contrast to net cash (used
for) operating activities of 4) million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 4.3 million improvement in net
cash provided by operating activities between the two nine-month periods was largely caused by the 2 million decrease in the net loss
and a 1.7 million swing from cash (used for) inventory build to an inventory reduction. Our inventory balance decreased by 351,000
to 7.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from 7.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Interest expense (excluding amortization of debt
issuance and debt discount costs) was 401,000 and 311,000 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Our debt bears interest at fixed rates. The blended interest rate on the debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023
was 4.51 per annum. We anticipate that interest expense (excluding amortization of debt issuance and debt discount costs) will be 524,000
and 452,000 during the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Our total non-cash depreciation, amortization and stock-based
compensation expense was approximately 2.3 million during both of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We anticipate
that depreciation expense (largely pertaining to Re-Tain ),
while not affecting our cash flows from operations, will be a significant factor in creating annual net operating losses until and unless
product sales increase sufficiently to offset these non-cash expenses. 

Net
cash used for investing activities was 265,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to net cash used
for investing activities of 1.9 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 consisting primarily of cash spent to
fund the purchase of property, plant and equipment. To conserve cash at this time, we have deferred all large dollar capital expenditure
projects. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 2.7 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to net cash
provided by financing activities of 2.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. We had aggregate debt outstanding
(net of debt issuance and debt discount costs) of approximately 11 million and 12 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. Debt principal repayments (excluding the line of credit) aggregated 1.1 million and 829,000 during the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We anticipate that debt principal repayments will aggregate approximately 1.5
million during both of the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025. During the first quarter of 2024, the availability of our 1 million
line of credit, which bears interest at the National Prime Rate per annum, was extended until September 11, 2025. No draw on our line
of credit was outstanding as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Financing activities included a 3 million debt financing during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. See Note 10 to the accompanying unaudited financial statements for more information about
our bank debt. During the second quarter of 2024, we entered into an ATM Agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, pursuant to which
we may offer and sell up to 11 million of shares of our common stock. As of October 30, 2024, we had sold 1,160,725 shares under the
at the market offering conducted pursuant to the ATM Agreement. Net proceeds through October 30, 2024 (net of approximately 152,000
in upfront legal, accounting and other fees and approximately 132,000 in sales commissions) were approximately 4,114,000. Gross proceeds
from these sales during the three-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 were approximately 418,000 and 3.7 million,
respectively. The ATM Agreement gives our board the flexibility to evaluate the potential uses of the proceeds while considering the
cost of dilution in real time. This funding has provided a very productive financial bridge for us to fund our operations, while we work
to improve our gross margin and reduce product development expenses. While the capital raised is not enough to fund larger capital expenditure
investments, such as further increasing First Defense production capacity or building our own facility for the
aseptic filling services for Re-Tain , it has allowed us to release funding for certain smaller and necessary capital
expenditures. Further, as we fill the order backlog, we will require additional capital to fund an anticipated increase in inventory
levels.

Based
on our best estimates and projections, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, together with gross margin anticipated to be earned
from ongoing product sales will be sufficient to meet our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements and
to finance our ongoing business operations for at least 12 months (which is the period of time required to be addressed for such purposes
by accounting disclosure standards) from the date of this filing. The table below summarizes the changes in selected key accounts (in

Capital
Expenditure Investments 

During
the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, we invested the aggregate of 4.2 million to construct a 7,100 square foot facility addition
at 56 Evergreen Drive Building 56 and related equipment (primarily Freeze-Dryer #2) and cold storage capacity increasing our
freeze-drying capacity by 100 and making other improvements to our liquid processing capacity, which increased our annual production
capacity (in terms of annual sales dollars) to approximately 16.5 million. When we describe the production capacity for the First
Defense product line in this Quarterly Report, it should be noted that the actual value of this capacity varies based
on biological and process yields, product format mix, selling price and other factors. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed
this investment, which also included the construction and equipping of a pilot plant for small-scale Drug Substance (DS) production for
 Re-Tain within Building 56 . After construction of the DS production facility for Re-Tain 
at 33 Caddie Lane Building 33) was completed, this space was converted for use in the production of the gel tube formats of the
 First Defense product line. After renovations of our leased facility at 175 Industrial Way Building 175A)
 were completed during the second quarter of 2020, this space was converted to double our liquid processing capacity. 

During
the four-year period ended December 31, 2018, we invested the aggregate of 21.6 million to construct a DS production facility for Re-Tain 
 at Building 33 . During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed construction of the DS production facility. We began
equipment installation during the third quarter of 2017, and we completed this installation during the third quarter of 2018. The total
cost of this investment for the DS production facility and related processing equipment was 20.8 million plus 331,000 for the land
and 472,000 for the acquisition of an adjacent 4,080 square foot warehouse facility at 14 Wedge Way Building 14) , which will
be used for packing, shipping and cold storage of Re-Tain and other warehousing needs. 

During
2018, it became clear that demand for Tri-Shield First Defense was outpacing production. In response to this increasing
demand, we began a series of investments during 2019 to increase our production capacity for the First Defense 
product line from approximately 16.5 million to an estimate of approximately 30 million per year (with an option to increase further
to approximately 40 million in the future). The primary purpose of the additional investment in First Defense 
is to fulfill the current backlog and materially reduce the risk of another order backlog. Operating at very close to 100 of available
capacity is not efficient or sustainable. Our objective is to be in position to operate without significant contaminations at the capacity
level we choose to cover sales with adequate buffer stock, which would allow more time for necessary preventative maintenance. We also
need to meet or exceed our production yield assumptions to succeed. Our production process is a very complicated one, which makes it
difficult to scale-up quickly. We remain deeply committed to continuing to supply First Defense to the market
over the long term, despite the current short supply that we have been experiencing.

The
primary purpose of the additional investments in Re-Tain is to bring the formulation and aseptic filling capabilities
for Re-Tain Drug Product (DP) into available space in our DS facility in order to lessen or eliminate our reliance
on third-party DP manufacturing services as well as to build out warehouse space at Building 14 for packing and shipping facilities
for Re-Tain . We began initial installation of the filling equipment during the first quarter of 2022 and then
paused this installation work pending concurrence with the FDA pertaining to our third submission of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and
Controls (CMC) Technical Section, which is discussed in greater detail below.

(1) The
investments of approximately 3.5 million of these funds to increase First Defense production capacity from approximately
 30 million to 40 million per year and approximately 2 million to build an in-house aseptic filling facility for Re-Tain 
 have been deferred for the time being, due to the loss in gross margin earned caused by the slowdown in production output necessary
to remediate certain contamination events. These figures are estimates for the work to be completed based on historic quotations and
are not based on current cost quotations or contracts that have been updated or adjusted to account for inflation, project scope change
and other factors. 

The
first phase of the additional investments in First Defense beginning in 2019 included significant renovations
to a 14,300 square foot leased facility at Building 175A , some facility modifications at Building 56 and the necessary
production equipment (including Freeze-Dryer #3) to increase our liquid processing capacity by 100 and our freeze-drying capacity by
50 . This resulted in increasing the annual production capacity of the First Defense product line (in terms of
annual sales dollars) from approximately 16.5 million to approximately 23 million. Renovations of Building 175A to enable this
expansion were completed during the second quarter of 2020. By moving our powder and gel filling and assembly operations from Building
56 into this new space, we created space at Building 56 for the installation of the expanded freeze-drying capacity. The new
facilities are built to contemporary current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards with efficient material and people flows.
A site license approval for this new facility was issued by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
during the third quarter of 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, we completed the relocation of our gel formulation equipment from
 Building 56 to Building 175A , which created the space necessary to double our liquid processing capacity at Building
56 . We obtained site license approval of the expanded freeze-drying capacity (Freeze-Dryer #3) at Building 56 from the USDA
during the third quarter of 2021, and we obtained site license approval of the expanded liquid processing capacity at Building 56
 from the USDA during the third quarter of 2022. This investment also included equipment and vehicle purchases necessary to expand
and improve our colostrum collection capabilities and logistics. 

The
second phase of the additional investments in First Defense included the installation of Freeze-Dryer #4 to further
increase the estimated annual production capacity of the First Defense product line (in terms of annual sales
dollars) by an additional 33 from approximately 23 million to approximately 30 million. As of July of 2022, we had completed almost
all of the facility expansion work and new equipment installations needed to increase our production capacity to almost 30 million per
year. However, the most critical piece of new equipment (being Freeze-Dryer #4) was delivered six months late by the fabricator. Regardless,
by the end of 2022, we had Freeze-Dryer #4 installed and approved for use by the USDA. At the same time, Freeze-Dryer #2 stopped operating
requiring a six-month repair and netting us back to three operating freeze dryers during the first half of 2023. As of July of 2023,
we were back to four operating freeze dryers. This investment also included equipment and facility modifications to scale-up and upgrade
our vaccine manufacturing capacity and improve our quality laboratories at Building 56 as well as the installation of new equipment
to increase the throughput of our gel filling operations at Building 175A .

Corporation 

The
third phase of the additional investments in First Defense involved the construction of an additional 15,400 square
feet of space adjacent to and connected to Building 175A at 175 Industrial Way Building 175B and new equipment to further
increase our estimated annual First Defense production capacity from approximately 30 million to approximately
 40 million with options for further expansion. Given the long lead time required for investments like this, we initiated this project
by entering into a lease amendment during the third quarter of 2022 covering a to-be-constructed building shell for approximately 250,000
per year. Construction of the building shell by our landlord was substantially complete as of April 1, 2023, and rent payments commenced
as of August 1, 2023. We made this lease commitment because of the unique proximity of the land adjacent to our currently leased space
and the high level of demand for properties of this type in the Portland market. We did not want to risk losing this opportunity to others.
The anticipated benefits to us from this new lease include: i) space for the potential to install Freeze-Dryers #5, #6, #7 and #8 if
justified by market demand in the future, ii) improved space and quality for our powder milling operations by separating our upstream
processes (liquid processing) at Building 56 from our clean downstream processes (milling, formulation, filling and packaging)
and iii) much needed additional warehouse space. We have been running our equipment and staff close to 100 of capacity in order to fill
the backlog of orders. One of our objectives is to create a more sustainable production schedule. Freeze-Dryer #5 is the key piece of
equipment required to allow us to increase our estimated annual production capacity to above 30 million. Based on past experience, we
are planning for approximately 18 months of lead time for fabrication, installation, qualification and implementation of Freeze-Dryer
#5. However, due to the loss in gross margin during 2023 caused by the slowdown in production output necessary to remediate the product
contamination events discussed below, we have decided to defer most of this investment, for the time being. Instead, we initiated the
initial steps of this project with a reduced budget of approximately 700,000 at Building 175B during the third quarter of 2023.
This work was completed during the first quarter of 2024, which provided additional warehousing space and allowed us to move all shipping
and receiving functions out of Building 56 to create more space for liquid processing at Building 56 . In consideration
for our landlord agreeing to pay for the cost of those certain tenant improvements and after two negotiated amendments, we are now obligated
to make additional rent payments of 20,000 per month through June of 2025 and a final additional rent payment of 248,743 in July of
2025. 

Production
Contamination Events 

As
our increased production capacity was coming online, a first product contamination event likely related to our incoming raw material
(that is sourced from many different cows at many different farms) was detected by standard in-process quality control testing around
the end of the third quarter of 2022. We took immediate steps to address the contamination, and production ran without issue during the
balance of the fourth quarter of 2022. Subsequently, as we began to operate at a higher level of capacity at the beginning of 2023, we
were forced to slow down production again to remediate a second contamination event also likely related to our incoming raw material.
We then ran for approximately six months without contamination and then experienced a smaller third contamination event in September
of 2023 impacting two lots of Work-in-Progress inventory likely related to our increased level of liquid processing. Although all of
the incoming material utilized in this production phase had passed quality control testing, the product failed the quality control tests
later in the production process. We experienced a fourth contamination event impacting three lots of Work-in-Process inventory during
the first three and a half months of 2024. New remediation steps implemented in response to this fourth event during the second half
of April of 2024 appear to be very successful so far because we have run without contamination since then and through the date of the
filing of this Quarterly Report. Throughout these contamination events, all product that was sold to market had passed final release
testing to meet USDA-required quality standards. 

As
we look back at these production contamination events, we believe that the root cause of the initial contaminations was associated with
rapid growth at the farms where we acquire our raw material. Having largely remediated that problem, we experienced additional contaminations
that we believe were largely caused by our rapidly increased production capacity. Our proprietary production process allows us to create
an effective product out of a non-aseptic starting raw material. This requires a careful monitoring of the tradeoff between the benefit
of adding more heat for longer periods of time to reduce bacterial load against the alternative benefit of less heat for shorter periods
of time to preserve more antibody content. Although using more heat could potentially reduce bacterial load, our yield is higher when
we use less heat. For example, we know that putting our Work-in-Process inventory through freeze/thaw cycles is not beneficial to yield
and increases the risk of contamination. One effective improvement we have implemented, where appropriate, is to lengthen the time of
a heat treatment step instead of running two shorter heat treatment steps separated by a freeze/thaw. As we continue to optimize this
critical process parameter, we believe we can significantly reduce the risk of further contaminations and improve our gross margin.

ImmuCell
Corporation 

Although
these types of losses are expected to happen from time to time in the production of a biological product such as ours, we believe that
the sudden and large contamination events were related in several different ways to our efforts to increase production output. We also
believe we have mitigated the risk of reoccurrence of such losses through the implementation of certain new quality control steps and
manufacturing process and facility improvements. To meet our goals, we must run without significant equipment failures or contamination
losses, and we must improve our production yields. 

The
production contamination events and other production process losses experienced resulted in scrapped inventory valued as shown in the

 estimate approximates the retail value of this work-in-process inventory in the event that
 additional costs had been incurred to complete the production process to prepare it for sale
 utilizing the approximate product format mix and selling prices effective during the period. 

We
believe that we have moved past the contamination events that materially affected our output since late 2022 largely because we have
not experienced another contamination since the first half of April of 2024. However, we still have more work to do to catch up to product
demand. As we continue to optimize our investments to increase production capacity and to implement the corrective actions being taken
in response to these contamination events, we aspire to reach an annual theoretical maximum production capacity of approximately 30
million per year going forward. While we produced far less than we needed during 2023, we believe that our remediation efforts are allowing
us to steadily ramp back up to full production capacity. As we resume full production, our goal is to be able to produce at least 6
million or more worth of product per quarter, which would annualize to about 80 or more of our estimated 30 million annual production
capacity to balance production output with regularly scheduled preventative maintenance. Finished goods produced increased steadily from
approximately 3.3 million to 4 million and further to 5.3 million during the first, second and third quarters of 2023, respectively,
before dropping modestly to 5.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. We were able to increase finished goods production to 7.2
million during the first quarter of 2024, which annualizes to approximately 28.7 million. This level of production will remain our aspirational
goal, but we do not expect that it can be repeated or exceeded on a regular basis. During the second quarter of 2024, finished goods
production decreased to 5.5 million, which annualizes to approximately 22 million. During the third quarter of 2024, finished goods
production decreased modestly to 5.4 million, which annualizes to approximately 21.8 million. During the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024, finished goods production was approximately 18.1 million, which annualizes to approximately 24.2 million (or approximately
81 of 30 million). During the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024, finished goods production was approximately 23.2
million (or approximately 77 of 30 million). 

The
learnings from the remediation of the contamination events have improved our production processes going forward. We have implemented
several important improvements at the source farm level including more product and environmental testing, more training of farm staff
and better enforcement of our protocols. While we never release product to the market that does not pass our final quality control release
tests, we had allowed product to advance in the production process at risk, while the in-process quality control tests were being performed.
We no longer advance product to the next stage at risk before the complete in-process quality control test results are available. While
this does add time to the overall production cycle, we believe that it has helped us reduce the cost of further contaminations. Notwithstanding
the challenges that contamination events have posed for us, we are excited to be approaching both our estimated full capacity of approximately
 30 million per year for First Defense (with an option to increase our estimated full capacity to approximately
 40 million per year in the future with the additional capital investments discussed above) while, at the same time, advancing to the
final stages of a very significant FDA product development initiative with Re-Tain . 

Since
February of 2023, we have been pursuing an insurance claim under our business interruption policy to offset a small portion of the losses
that we have incurred related to the contamination events discussed above. While our financial losses are far larger, we are seeking
an insurance benefit of approximately 700,000. To date, we have received 250,000. The balance of this claim remains under review by
our underwriter. We cannot estimate the likelihood of our success with this claim.

Our
near-term goal is to increase and stabilize supply, regain lost business and re-establish our growth curve. If we are able to achieve
our goal of balancing supplies to meet projected demand by the end of 2024, we anticipate being able to achieve approximately 24 million
in sales during 2024. This projection not only aims to meet end-user demand but also to replenish the distribution chain with the necessary
buffer stock. This target would surpass our total product sales of approximately 17.5 million and 18.6 million achieved during the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our longer-term goal is to exceed 35 million of annual total product sales as
soon as possible during the four-year period after the market launch of Re-Tain . We do not solely benchmark our
sales expectations off trailing twelve-month sales results. Instead, we look at the sales of competitive products to assess the size
of the addressable market and plan for growth when projecting our future production capacity needs.

We
obtained USDA approval of Tri-Shield First Defense (the trivalent format of our product delivered via a gel tube,
which provides broader protection to calves) near the end of 2017. Around the time of this new product format launch, total product sales
during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 were 10.4 million and 11 million, respectively. While this product is very well received
by the market for its effectiveness, it does require two separate liquid production processes for each dose of Tri-Shield 
 manufactured and sold (in contrast to the bivalent product formats that require just one) which makes it more expensive to
produce. This new product format has become the highest revenue contributor, as demonstrated in the table below (in thousands, except

We
likely lost some business beginning in 2022 and through the first half of 2024 as a result of the backlog. During the first half of 2023,
the impact of tight supplies hit even harder leaving our customers without product during their busiest calving season. The 2023 production
shortage caused largely by the contamination events discussed above may prove to be more detrimental to our growth curve than any prior
production shortage because it depleted distributor inventories and impacted more customers for a longer period of time. Our inability
to timely meet the needs of our customers could result in the loss of some customers who seek alternative scours management products
during this period of short supply, and some of these customers may not resume purchasing our product when we have eliminated the backlog.
While we worked to allocate product directly to certain large customers during this period of short supply, we likely lost some customers
that could not procure product. While backlog is a better problem to have than seeing product expiring on our shelves, it is nonetheless
a significant challenge when we do not get our customers everything that they want. Our sales team is resuming more normal sales growth
initiatives now, in anticipation of product supply exceeding customer demand over the next five to six months. We will work to regain
end-user customers that we may have lost while we were short on product and will aggressively compete for new business. As we emerge
from an extended period of time on backlog, we anticipate higher than normal sales fluctuations quarter to quarter. What is most important
to us at this time is that we achieve sales growth over the longer periods of time, even if we experience some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.

The
production slowdown during the first ten months of 2023, in part, caused an increase in the amount of our order backlog. We cannot be
certain that this backlog will be converted to sales. Valuation of the backlog is a non-GAAP estimate that is based on purchase orders
on hand at the time that could not be met because of a lack of available inventory. We are reporting this figure because it reflects
the orders on our books presently that we cannot ship. Quantification of the backlog during the current periods has become far less comparable
to prior periods. At times, customers have placed orders for more than a month s worth of their demand, perhaps in reaction to
our ongoing backlog situation, whereas in the past they ordered more closely in line with their current demand. We are concerned that
this backlog amount may not be highly relevant at this time as it includes very old orders, redundancy in demand and orders that may
be cancelled given the time that has passed since they were originally placed.

The
backlog was reduced from approximately 2.4 million as of December 31, 2021 to approximately 205,000 as of September 30, 2022. In part
because of a first contamination event experienced around the end of the third quarter of 2022, our backlog increased to approximately
 2.5 million as of December 31, 2022. In part because of a second contamination event experienced during the first quarter of 2023, the
backlog continued to increase to approximately 7.5 million as of March 31, 2023, to approximately 8 million as of June 30, 2023, to
approximately 8.9 million as of September 30, 2023 and to approximately 9.4 million as of December 31, 2023. We were able to reduce
this backlog modestly to approximately 9.1 million as of March 31, 2024 and then reduce it further to approximately 8.9 million as
of June 30, 2024. We were able to reduce this backlog further to approximately 7.3 million and 6.8 million as of September 30, 2024
and October 30, 2024, respectively. As sales demand increased while our production output was reduced, the value of our order backlog
has increased as demonstrated in the following table:

We
also sell our own CMT , which is used to detect somatic cell counts in milk. Sales of CMT aggregated approximately 1 of
our total product sales during the periods reported. Sales of CMT increased by 65 , or 24,000, to 60,000 during the three-month
period ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Sales of CMT increased by 15 ,
or 18,000, to 140,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 in comparison to the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. Sales of CMT increased by 23 , or 37,000, to 196,000 during the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024,
in comparison to the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2023. 

Effective
January 1, 2022, we increased our selling price of the First Defense product line by approximately 5 and CMT
 by approximately 7 . Effective January 1, 2023, we increased our selling price of the First Defense product
line by approximately 4 (range of 2 to 8 and CMT by approximately 5 . Effective November 15, 2023, we adjusted the pricing
of backlogged orders to accommodate our rising costs of goods and eliminate any irrelevant purchase orders. We notified distributors
that all pending orders would either be removed from our system or modified (with their authorization) to reflect the new pricing structure
representing an increase of approximately 8 . Subsequently, most distributors opted to increase the prices on these older purchase orders
to retain them on the list for fulfillment. The backlog of orders was worth approximately 9 million just before this price change. Also,
effective November 15, 2023, we increased our selling price for CMT by approximately 12 .

The
gross margin during recent periods was significantly less than what we anticipate going forward. The 2023 reduction in production output
was largely the result of our decision to slow down our production rate while remediating the production contamination events discussed
above. During 2023, we did not benefit from spreading our fixed costs over higher volumes as we normally do. Further, we did not furlough
any labor during this production slowdown. As we build back sales during 2024, we are increasing the amount of gross margin earned compared
to prior periods and improving the gross margin as a percentage of sales compared to 2023. The gross margin as a percentage of product
sales was 22 , 41 , 45 , 45 , 49 , 47 and 50 during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The 22 gross margin percentage during the year ended December 31, 2023 (including even lower gross margin percentages during the three-month
period ended March 31, 2023 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2023) was our lowest ever. Achieving process yield improvements (in
addition to running without significant equipment failures or product contaminations) will be essential to increasing our gross margin
in future periods. Some of the critical process parameters that we are investigating include optimizing: 1) the time and temperature
for pasteurization steps, 2) a critical filtration step and 3) the antibody content of incoming Work-in-Process inventory. As we fully
integrate and utilize our increased capacity and evaluate our product costs and selling price, we believe we could increase our gross
margin by approximately 8 to 13 percentage points in comparison to the 27 gross margin reported for the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024. Our immediate goal is to resume a 35 gross margin as soon as possible with the next goal being to achieve a 40 gross margin.
This goal has been reduced from prior projections given the lower rates experienced during 2023 and to date in 2024. 

While
our biological and process yields continue to be variable, we have seen a favorable improvement to our finished goods yield recently.
The Tri-Shield product format is more complex (i.e., three antibodies versus two antibodies for Dual-Force making it more costly to produce, and both the bivalent and trivalent gel product formats are more expensive to produce than the bolus
format. These new formats are creating sales growth for us, and we are focused on increasing total gross margin dollars, even if that
is accomplished with a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales. A number of other factors contribute to the variability in our costs,
resulting in some fluctuations in gross margin percentages from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We also invest to sustain compliance
with cGMP in our production processes. Increasing production can be more expensive in the initial stages. To achieve our inventory production
growth objectives, we continue to acquire more raw material (colostrum) from many more cows at several new farms. Additionally, the biological
yields from our raw material are always variable, which impacts our costs of goods sold in a similar way. Just as our customers 
cows respond differently to commercial dam-level vaccines, depending on the time of year and immune competency, our source cows have
similar biological variances in response to our proprietary vaccines. As is the case with any vaccine program, animals respond less effectively
to their first exposure to a new vaccine, and thereafter the effectiveness of their immune response improves in response to subsequent
immunizations. While this variability impacts our costs of producing inventory, the commercial value of our First Defense 
 product line is that we compensate for the variability in a cow s immune response by standardizing each dose of finished
product. This ensures that every calf is equally protected, which is something that dam-level commercial scours vaccines cannot offer.
We continue to work on processing and yield improvements and other opportunities to reduce costs, while enhancing process knowledge and
robustness. Additionally, the significant global supply-chain disruptions that almost all industries are experiencing presently are a
challenge to us. The costs of our critical supplies, components, raw materials, utilities and services increased significantly during
2021 and that trend continued during 2022, 2023 and into 2024. We have little choice but to pay the higher prices and try to take on
more months of supply than we would have held previously if we could get our orders fulfilled timely. We believe that gross margin trends
going forward should be viewed over longer periods of time than just one quarter.

Work-in-Process
inventory as a percentage of total inventory has ranged from 57 to 82 , and the dollar value of Work-in-Process inventory has increased
significantly since December 31, 2021. The hyper-immunized colostrum we purchase for use in the production of First Defense 
 is the largest component of Work-in-Process inventory. As we began to increase our production capacity, we also increased the
supplier base that we work with in order to increase the amount of this critical ingredient. As certain contamination events discussed
above slowed the implementation of our increased capacity, we accumulated more colostrum than originally planned. While this is a good
safety measure to have in place to ensure that we do not run short of colostrum, we do expect to reduce this use of cash as we move forward
with our increased production rate. Also, we are developing what could potentially be a spray-dried alternative format of First Defense 
 that would not require the liquid processing and freeze-drying production steps used to produce First Defense 
 in a capsule or gel tube. If successful, this effort could expand our product portfolio with a bulk product designed to meet
the needs of large dairy and calf-ranch customers at a lower cost. This would help us turn some of this inventory to cash sooner. In
a frozen state, this colostrum has a 30-month useable shelf life. The increase in Work-in-Process inventory is demonstrated in the following

Product Development Expenses and Strategy 

Overview:
 The majority of our product development expenses pertain to the development of Re-Tain .
During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, product development expenses decreased by 30 , or 332,000, to 786,000 in comparison
to 1.1 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Product development expenses aggregated 13 and 21 of product
sales during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product development expenses included non-cash
depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses of 367,000 and 391,000 during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. Approximately 342,000 and 353,000 of these non-cash expenses were comprised of depreciation expenses pertaining
largely to our DS facility and equipment for Re-Tain during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, product development expenses decreased by 7 , or 249,000,
to 3.1 million in comparison to 3.3 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Product development expenses aggregated
16 and 27 of product sales during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product development expenses
included non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation expenses of approximately 1.1 million during both of the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Approximately 1 million of these non-cash expenses were comprised of depreciation expenses pertaining
largely to our DS facility and equipment for Re-Tain during both of the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023. We began depreciating this asset when the Certificate of Occupancy for the new construction was issued during the fourth
quarter of 2017, but sales of our new product cannot be realized until we achieve FDA approval. Product development expenses (excluding
depreciation expense of 1.4 million) were 3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, when we were in production mode. Beginning
during the second half of 2024, we implemented an aggressive idle of product development expenses pertaining to Re-Tain 
 after the production of inventory intended for our Controlled Launch was completed. It is
our goal to reduce product development expenses (excluding depreciation) to approximately 2.5 million during the year ending December
31, 2024. This would represent a 17 , or 519,000, reduction from the 2023 expense (excluding depreciation). Product development expenses
(excluding depreciation) were 1.6 million during the six-month period ended June 30, 2024. This means that it is our objective to reduce
product development expenses by approximately 45 , or approximately 731,000, during the second half of 2024 in comparison to the first
half of 2024. It is our further objective to reduce product development expenses (excluding depreciation) to approximately 2 million
during the year ending December 31, 2025, which would be a 20 , or approximately 490,000, decrease from the projected 2024 level. This
aggressive idle strategy (as opposed to a complete shut down) allows us to continue our pursuit of FDA approval while reducing our cash
spend and ensuring no adverse impact to critical equipment. We have a plan to bring the DS plant back to full production mode in approximately
two to three months, subject to available funding.

During
the third quarter of 2016, the City of Portland approved a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) credit enhancement package that reduces the
real estate taxes on Building 33 (our DS production facility for Re-Tain by 65 over the eleven-year period
beginning on July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2028 and by 30 during the year ending June 30, 2029, at which time the rebate expires.
During the second quarter of 2017, the TIF was approved by the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development. The value of the
tax savings will increase (decrease) in proportion to any increases (decreases) in the assessment of the building for city real estate
tax purposes or the City s tax rate. The following table discloses how much of the new taxes we have generated is being relieved
by the TIF and how much we are paying:

Development
objective: As we work to change the way that mastitis is managed in the dairy industry, we aim to demonstrate
that our bacteriocin, Nisin A, which is designed specifically for subclinical mastitis, can provide producers the freedom to change when
and how mastitis is treated. Re-Tain is not a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in human health. Rather, it consists
of a highly targeted active ingredient without an FDA-required milk discard or meat withhold. While milk prices vary, the cost of the
milk discard associated with traditional antibiotics ranges from approximately 36.00 (for 3.5 days of milk at 60 pounds per day at the
Class III milk price average of 17.02 per hundredweight during 2023) to approximately 150.00 (for 11 days of milk at 80 pounds per
day at the Class III milk price average of 17.02 per hundredweight during 2023) per treated animal. These high milk discard costs associated
with traditional antibiotic treatments lead producers to only treat mastitis after clinical signs develop. We expect that Re-Tain 
 will be a first-of-its-kind product that can be used to economically treat at the earliest stage of infection, giving producers
the ability to get ahead of mastitis before clinical signs develop so the best cows stay at their best performance level and in the herd
longer. 

Development
status : Approval by the FDA of the New Animal Drug Application (NADA) for Re-Tain 
is required before any sales of the product can be initiated. The NADA is comprised of five principal Technical Sections plus a sixty-day
administrative review at the end. Each Technical Section can be reviewed and approved separately. By statute, each Technical Section
submission is generally subject to one or more six-month review cycles by the FDA. Upon review and assessment by the FDA that all requirements
for a Technical Section have been met, the FDA may issue a Technical Section Complete Letter. The current status of our work on these
submissions to the FDA is as follows: 

1)
Environmental Impact: During the third quarter of 2008, we received the Environmental Impact Technical Section Complete Letter from the
FDA. During the second quarter of 2021, we received further clarification through a new Environmental Impact Technical Section Complete
Letter covering the current dosage regimen and labeling. 

40 

ImmuCell
Corporation 

2)
Target Animal Safety: During the second quarter of 2012, we received the Target Animal Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from
the FDA. 

3)
Effectiveness: During the third quarter of 2012, we received the Effectiveness Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA. The anticipated
product label (which remains subject to FDA approval) carries claims for the treatment of subclinical mastitis associated with Streptococcus
agalactiae , Streptococcus dysgalactiae , Streptococcus
uberis , and coagulase-negative staphylococci in lactating dairy cattle. 

Subclinical
mastitis, and the study required to achieve an effectiveness claim for it, is defined under the FDA/Center for Veterinary Medicine Guidance
#49: Target Animal Safety and Drug Effectiveness Studies for Anti-Microbial Bovine Mastitis Products (Lactating and Non-Lactating Cow
Products). Trial eligibility requires both pretreatment samples to be positive for the mastitis pathogen (except for Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae , where a single pretreatment
sample qualifies a cow for enrollment). For all pathogens, both samples taken between 14 and 28 days post treatment (and at least
5 days apart) must be negative to be judged a cure. These conservative criteria generally result in enrolling cows with chronic
subclinical disease, which rarely self-resolves . 

4)
Human Food Safety: During the third quarter of 2018, we received the Human Food Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA
confirming, among other things, a zero milk discard period and a zero meat withhold period during and after treatment with our product.
Achieving this critical differentiating feature for our product encouraged us to continue the significant product development investment
necessary to bring Re-Tain 
 to market. It would have been hard to justify an ongoing investment of this nature in a product without
this significant competitive advantage. During the second quarter of 2021, we updated this Technical Section Complete Letter with FDA
approval of the official analytical method to measure Nisin in milk. 

5)
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC): The CMC Technical Section is very complex and comprehensive. Having previously achieved
the four different Technical Section Complete Letters from the FDA discussed above, approval of the CMC Technical Section is the fifth
and final significant step required before Re-Tain 
 product sales can be initiated
in the United States. Implementing DS production, which is a required component of the CMC Technical Section, has been the most lengthy
part of this project. We previously entered into an agreement with a multi-national pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer for our commercial-scale
supplies of DS. However, we determined during 2014 that the agreement did not offer us the most advantageous supply arrangement in terms
of either cost or long-term dependability. As a result, we presented this product development opportunity to a variety of large and small
animal health companies. While such a corporate partnership could have provided access to a much larger sales and marketing team and
allowed us to avoid the large investment in a commercial-scale production facility, we concluded that a partner would have taken an unduly
large share of the gross margin from all future product sales of Re-Tain .
However, the regulatory and marketing feedback that we received from prospective partners, following their due diligence, was positive.
During the third quarter of 2014, we completed an investment in facility modifications and processing equipment necessary to produce
our DS at pilot-scale at our 56 Evergreen Drive facility. This small-scale facility was used to: i) expand our process knowledge and
controls, ii) establish operating ranges for critical process parameters, iii) conduct product stability studies, iv) optimize process
yields and v) determine the cost of production. We believe these efforts have reduced the risks associated with our investment in the
commercial-scale DS production facility. Having raised equity during 2016 and 2017, we were able to move away from these earlier partnering
strategies and assume control over the commercial-scale manufacturing process in our own facility. During the fourth quarter of 2015,
we acquired land near our existing Portland facility for the construction of a new commercial-scale DS production facility. We commenced
construction of this facility during the third quarter of 2016 and completed construction during the fourth quarter of 2017. Equipment
installation and qualification was initiated during the third quarter of 2017 and completed during the third quarter of 2018. Total construction
and equipment costs aggregated approximately 20.8 million. With construction of the facility complete, we continue to work with outside
parties to investigate improvements to our DS production yields as well as potential efficacy enhancements.

Under
the FDA s phased submission process, we made a first-phased DS submission (without the DP submission) during the first quarter
of 2019 that included data from the DS Registration Batches produced at commercial scale in our new DS manufacturing facility. This first-phased
submission was followed by a second-phased submission covering both DS and DP, during the first quarter of 2021. The second-phased DS
and DP submission responded to comments raised by the FDA regarding the first-phased DS submission and included detailed information
about the manufacturing process and controls for DP. One of the key components of the second-phased DS and DP submission was also demonstrating
stability of the product through expiry. During the third quarter of 2021, the FDA issued a Technical Section Incomplete Letter (Incomplete
Letter) with regard to this second-phased DS and DP submission. This response was not unexpected as it is common for the FDA to issue
queries and comments, especially related to an aseptic DP submission. We made a second DS and DP submission of the CMC Technical Section
during the first quarter of 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, we received an Incomplete Letter from the FDA with regards to this
second DS and DP submission of the CMC Technical Section. The Incomplete Letter required that internal and external laboratories re-develop
and qualify several analytical tests and associated controls. 

We
made a third DS and DP submission of the CMC Technical Section during the third quarter of 2023. In late October of 2023, the FDA notified
us that it was refusing to review our third submission because Norbrook was identified as the DP manufacturer in our submission, but
the FDA was expecting that we would identify our own in-house services as the DP manufacturer (instead of Norbrook). This miscommunication
was due to a statement in our April of 2022 response to an FDA 483 inspectional observation in which we noted that Norbrook was expected
to exit the DP manufacturing agreement with us at the end of 2022, which would have required us to procure and install some long lead
time equipment (filler and labeler) in our DS suite in late 2022. Instead, we were able to extend the agreement with Norbrook to complete
the manufacture of DP inventory for the initial commercial sales under our Controlled Launch strategy. As a result, we continued to identify
Norbrook as our DP manufacturer. As a result of this miscommunication, we were required to re-submit our third submission the CMC Technical
Section in November of 2023. During May of 2024, the FDA issued another Incomplete Letter to us. Pursuant to this Incomplete Letter,
the FDA has provided some minor questions about our third submission requiring a fourth submission of the CMC Technical Section. The
FDA also noted that all inspectional observations at our DS facility and at the DP facility of our contract manufacturer must be cleared
before this fourth submission could be made. Subsequently, the FDA notified us during the second quarter of 2024 that the inspectional
observation at our DS facility had been cleared. 

We
anticipate making a Non-Administrative NADA submission that would include our fourth submission of the CMC Technical Section, together
with the minor technical sections covering All Other Information and Product Labeling during the fourth quarter of 2024. We are implementing
this filing strategy to eliminate the need for an Administrative NADA submission covering All Other Information and Product Labeling
at the end of the application process which would then be subject to an additional 60-day review at that time. By statute, this CMC Technical
Section submission would be subject to a review period of up to 180 days, but we believe that a shorter review period may be provided
because the responses to the CMC Incomplete Letter are not complex. We expect the FDA to complete this review only after it clears the
inspectional observations at the DP facility of our contract manufacturer, which is the critical path constraint. 

Upon
FDA approval, we intend to implement our Controlled Launch with product expiration dating estimated at between the second quarter of
2025 and the first quarter of 2026, subject to confirmation of final product shelf-life disposition by the FDA. While being prudent with
how much cash we invested in inventory that would have short expiry dating if market launch is delayed, we built DS inventory during
2022 and 2023 to support the initial commercial sales of Re-Tain .
We presently have no agreement in place to aseptically fill new DP inventory. During the second half of 2024, we began to reduce operating
costs at our DS production facility until initial market acceptance (and perhaps the interest of a marketing partner) justifies a new
agreement for aseptic filling and the production of additional inventory. We do anticipate a pause in the supply of product to market
after the initial launch goods are sold and before the product is re-launched with DP produced by our in-house aseptic filling operations
(if that investment is re-funded) or by an alternative contractor that we have not identified to date. While we do not expect Re-Tain 
 to make a significant contribution to our sales growth in the early years after market launch,
we do see value in achieving regulatory approval and testing market acceptance. 

Our
DS manufacturing facility and that of our DP contract manufacturer (and our potential future DP manufacturing facility) are subject to
ongoing FDA inspections. During the third quarter of 2019, the FDA conducted a pre-approval inspection of our DS facility. This resulted
in the issuance of certain deficiencies as identified on the FDA s Form 483. We submitted responses and data summaries in a phased
manner over the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter of 2022, the FDA conducted another pre-approval
inspection of our DS facility. This also resulted in the issuance of certain deficiencies as identified on the FDA s Form 483.
We have responded to all of the queries. Early during the first quarter of 2024, the FDA conducted another pre-approval inspection of
our DS facility. This resulted in the issuance of one deficiency as identified on the FDA s Form 483. Since then, we have successfully
responded to this inspectional observation. The remaining critical path milestone is for Norbrook to successfully complete closure of
deficiencies at their DP facility, which is currently underway. 

We
have always believed that the fastest route to FDA approval and market launch is with the services of Norbrook, reducing our risk by
benefiting from their demonstrated expertise in aseptic filling. From 2010 to the present, we have worked with Norbrook under several
amended contract manufacturing agreements covering the DP formulation, aseptic filling and final packaging services. Under our current
agreement, Norbrook is providing DP for our Controlled Launch with production into 2024. 

42

Our
potential alternative third-party options for the formulation and aseptic filling services that are presently being performed by Norbrook
are narrowed considerably because our product cannot be formulated or filled in a facility that also processes traditional antibiotics
(i.e., beta lactams). During the first quarter of 2022, we initiated an investment in the installation of equipment to produce DP at
our own facility at Building 33 . Given the loss in gross margin during the first ten months of 2023 caused by the slowdown in
production output that was necessary to remediate the production contamination events discussed above and feedback from the FDA during
their 2022 inspection, we decided to defer the completion of this investment for the time being. If we decide to resume the in-house
strategy, we would anticipate FDA approval of this facility (which is a requirement for commercial manufacturing) at least two years
after we resume spending on this project, allowing for two six-month review cycles, subject to the timing of our installation and validation
work. This will be a post-approval submission. If we decide to complete our potential future DP manufacturing facility, such facility
will, upon completion, be subject to FDA inspection and approval. We anticipate it would have enough formulation and aseptic filling
capacity to exceed the expected production capacity of our DS facility, which is approximately 7 million to 10 million in annual sales.
This production capacity estimate is based on our assumptions as to product pricing and does not yet reflect inventory build strategies
in advance of product approval or ongoing yield improvement initiatives. Establishing our own DP formulation and aseptic filling capability
would provide us with the longer-term advantage of controlling the manufacturing process for Re-Tain 
 in one facility, thereby potentially
reducing our manufacturing costs and eliminating international cold chain shipping logistics and costs. The DP formulation and aseptic
filling operation, if completed, will be located in existing facility space that we had intended to utilize to double our DS production
capacity if warranted by sales volumes following market launch. As a result, if we decide to complete this DP facility (rather than utilizing
a third party for these services), we would need to explore alternative strategies (in parallel with ongoing DS yield improvement initiatives)
to expand our DS production capacity. This integrated manufacturing capability for Re-Tain would
substantially reduce our dependence on third parties. Upon completion of our formulation and aseptic filling facility, the only significant
third-party input for Re-Tain would be the DP syringes. It is anticipated
that Hubert De Backer of Belgium (HDB) will supply these syringes in accordance with purchase orders that we submit. HDB is a syringe
supplier for many of the largest participants in the human and veterinary medical industries, and with whom Norbrook presently works.
Based on HDB s performance history and reputation in the industry, we are confident that HDB will be a dependable supplier of syringes
in the quantity and of the quality needed for Re-Tain . 

Other
product development initiatives: Our second most important product development initiative has been focused on other improvements, line
extensions or additions to our First Defense product line. The bolus format of First Defense 
and Tri-Shield First Defense have been listed with the Organic Materials Research Institute (OMRI) since 2013
and 2019, respectively. This means they can be used on organic farms. During the third quarter of 2024, the gel tube format of First
Defense also became OMRI listed. As discussed above, we are developing a potential spray-dried, bulk powder format
of First Defense . During the third quarter of 2024, we entered into a research agreement with the Mayo Clinic,
a non-profit, educational, research and healthcare institution, to explore potential applications of Nisin in certain human surgical
situations. Subject to the availability of resources, we intend to begin new development projects that are aligned with our core competencies
and market focus. We also remain interested in acquiring, on suitable terms, other new products and technologies that fit with our sales
focus on the dairy and beef industries, subject to the availability of the needed funding. 

d)
Sales and Marketing Expenses and Selling Strategy 

We
see ourselves as the non-pharma pharma company. Rather than offering variations of copy-cat technology like
vaccines and antibiotics, we have taken the path less traveled by developing first-of-their kind products fueled by novel active ingredients
such as polyclonal antibodies (for First Defense and bacteriocins (for Re-Tain ). While
we expect that Re-Tain could be a significant market disrupter, we project the First Defense 
 market could be larger, especially during the first years of our Controlled Launch of Re-Tain . We anticipate
that these category developing innovations will drive greater value for the livestock industry and, in turn, for our stockholders. 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses increased by 3 , or 27,000, to 844,000 in comparison
to 817,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 14 and 15 of product sales during the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses included non-cash depreciation and stock-based
compensation expenses of 44,000 and 35,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses increased by 9 , or 213,000, to 2.6 million in comparison
to 2.4 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 14 and 20 of product sales during the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses included non-cash depreciation and stock-based
compensation expenses of 131,000 and 121,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our current
budgetary guideline is to keep sales and marketing expenses under 20 of total sales. We continue to leverage the efforts of our small
sales force by using animal health distributors.

The
 First Defense product line serves dairy and beef producers by protecting their calf crop from scours, the leading
cause of pre-weaning mortality and morbidity. When calves are healthy during this crucial development period, they mature into more productive
milking cows and more efficient beef generators. Our primary competition in this category is vaccines that are also regulated for effectiveness
and safety by the USDA. However, animal responses to vaccines are inherently variable. COVID breakthrough infections in humans have reminded
us that a vaccine does not guarantee immunity. That is true for our competitors as well. In the most controlled research settings, only
80 of animals respond to a vaccine. This leaves 20 of the calf crop unprotected when the scour prevention program relies on scour vaccines.
Those unprotected calves can be disease carriers. Not only are they more susceptible to death or likely to require life-saving treatment
(sometimes with antibiotics), but they also shed pathogens into the environment creating a greater disease pressure for their herd mates.
The First Defense product line removes the inconsistency inherent with vaccine protection. We sell the only USDA-licensed
products in the scour prevention category that are therapeutic multi-valent polyclonal antibodies. This technology eliminates a producer s
reliance on a variable vaccine response to generate antibodies and, instead, can protect every calf equally with a measured dose of antibody-driven
immunity against both bacterial and viral scour pathogens. 

During
the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, we treated more calves than our next largest calf-level competitive product, which is
a vaccine administered to the newborn at birth. Compared to the dam-level competitive products (which are vaccines given to the cow pre-calving),
we are second in sales dollars to the market leader. Despite these successes, there remains significant opportunity to displace more
competition within North America. There is also opportunity to grow our sales by expanding into international markets. We are being strategic
in how we invest in international market development in order not to divert our limited resources away from achieving domestic growth,
which is often more efficient to obtain. 

We
believe that Re-Tain could revolutionize the way that mastitis is managed by making earlier treatment of subclinical
infections (while these cows are still producing saleable milk) economically feasible without an FDA-required milk discard or a meat
withhold during, or for a period of time after, treatment. No other FDA-approved mastitis treatment product on the market can offer this
value proposition. We believe we can demonstrate a return on investment to the dairy producer and the milk processor that will justify
a premium over other mastitis treatments on the market today, which are all sold subject to milk discard and meat withhold requirements.
By creating this value for our customers, we believe we can, in turn, create value for our stockholders. 

Re-Tain 
 could increase the lifetime profitability of a cow and reduce disease transfer to herd mates. It is common practice to move
sick cows from their regular herd group to a sick cow group for treatment and the related milk discard. This movement causes stress on
the cow and a reduction in milk production. While practices may vary farm-to-farm, there would be no requirement to move cows treated
with our product, allowing this costly drop in production to be avoided. It is generally current practice to treat mastitis only when
the disease has progressed to the clinical stage where the milk from an infected cow cannot be sold, leaving most subclinically infected
cows untreated. Without a milk discard cost, we expect producers to be more motivated to identify and treat cows at the subclinical stage.
This creates a substantial animal welfare benefit. By treating mastitis early at the subclinical level, producers could preserve optimal
milk yields. We also know that animals infected with subclinical mastitis have higher abortion rates and often progress to the clinical
disease state requiring antibiotic treatment and milk discard. We believe that societal animal welfare objectives will put more and more
pressure on the industry to treat cows with subclinical infections. 

The
over-use of antibiotics that are medically important to human healthcare is a growing public health concern of our society and an active
issue with the FDA, largely because of the growing evidence that this over-use contributes to antibiotic resistance and the rise of super-bugs .
Sustainability objectives require that less antibiotics be used in food producing animals, yet a new FDA-approved drug to treat mastitis
has not been developed in years. Our product improves sustainability by utilizing a bacteriocin as an alternative to traditional antibiotics
that are used in human medicine. In the big picture, we are introducing an entirely new class of antimicrobial as an animal drug, a bacteriocin,
that does not promote resistance against antibiotics used in human medicine making it more socially responsible. The industry could keep
treating this very significant disease with traditional antibiotics, but it takes innovation to bring a bacteriocin like Nisin to market.
 Re-Tain would, when introduced, offer a needed alternative to these traditional antibiotics, while at the same
time improving milk quality and the quantity of milk produced by treated cows. We believe our product fits very well with where the industry
is going to be in the coming years.

As
with all new products, the market determines the value. Our objective is to gain market acceptance of this new product concept as we
develop a new product category. Despite our product s exciting benefits, it will take time to change this longstanding treatment
paradigm and develop this new market. It will take time for the market to understand, evaluate, implement and adapt to the use and benefits
of Re-Tain . Based on consultations with industry experts and key opinion leaders, we have opted to carefully control
the launch of this novel product into the first quarter of 2026 or so, as we seek to transform the way that mastitis is treated in the
dairy industry over the long term. Our goal is to help early adopters select treatment candidates, develop easy to use protocols, optimize
treatment results and realize a positive return on their investment. We intend to limit initial distribution of Re-Tain 
 to a level that enables our sales team to select the optimal dairy farms at which to introduce Re-Tain and
to limit the initial number of participating farms so that the desired levels of support and guidance relating to effective usage of
 Re-Tain can be provided with our available resources. We recognize that it will be important to manage expectations
from the producer to the milk processor because it is possible that processors may express reservations with regards to the zero milk
discard claim. Our Controlled Launch strategy reduces the amount of inventory that we would need to build at risk before regulatory approval
is achieved. This strategic choice means that we have elected not to pursue an alternative strategy that might have maximized short-term,
initial sales quickly through a mass market approach where we provide product to distribution and let them sell it to as many farms as
possible. While we are dedicated to increasing our sales revenue, we considered available product supply and the damage a mass market
strategy could cause to the long-term value of the product. We have seen products sold by much larger companies that were substantially
damaged by such failed market launch strategies. We continue to develop detailed launch plans, focusing on the readiness of dairy operators
to successfully introduce Re-Tain to their herds. We believe that these prudent steps, while potentially leading
to lower initial Re-Tain revenues, may create a smooth and successful launch and could safeguard the longer term
performance of our investment in Re-Tain . We also believe that the operational adjustments and accommodations
that dairy farmers will need to make to effectively use Re-Tain and avoid the potential problems described under
 PART II: OTHER INFORMATION, ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS , to this Quarterly Report will not be so burdensome as to deter its adoption
and usage. Our overarching objective is to minimize the risk of early-stage unsatisfactory outcomes that could harm the longer-term prospects
and market acceptance of Re-Tain . 

e)
Administrative Expenses 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, administrative expenses increased by 3 , or 13,000, to 528,000 in comparison to 515,000
during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Administrative expenses amounted to 9 and 10 of product sales during the three-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Administrative expenses included non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation
expenses of 46,000 and 63,000 during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, administrative expenses increased by 3 , or 51,000, to 1.7 million in comparison to 1.6 million during
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Administrative expenses amounted to 9 and 13 of product sales during the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Administrative expenses included non-cash depreciation and stock-based compensation
expenses of 147,000 and 160,000 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We strive to be efficient
with these expenses while funding all the legal, audit and other costs associated with being a publicly-held company with a team of four
employees. Prior to 2014, we had limited our investment in investor relations spending. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, we initiated
an investment in a more active investor relations program. Given travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, this initiative
has pivoted to a virtual meeting format, which is less expensive. Having experienced this efficiency, it is our intent to continue with
the same strategy, for the most part, even though travel restrictions have been eliminated. At the same time, we continue to provide
full disclosure of the status of our business and financial condition in three quarterly reports and one annual report each year, as
well as in Current Reports on Form 8-K when legally required or deemed appropriate by management. We believe these efforts have helped
us access the capital markets to fund our growth objectives. Considering inflation and all the necessary support services that fit into
this category, we believe that approximately 2 million to 2.5 million per year is an efficient budget goal to fund the administrative
expenses of a publicly-held company. 

f)
Net Operating Loss 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, our net operating loss was 575,000 in comparison to a net operating loss of 1.2 million
during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 609,000 reduction in the net operating loss during the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 was largely caused by a 317,000 increase in gross
margin and a 332,000 decrease in product development expenses. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, our net operating
loss of 2.3 million was significantly less than our net operating loss of 4.7 million during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. The 2.5 million decrease in our net operating loss during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 was largely caused by the 2.5 million increase in gross margin.

g)
Other Expenses, net 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, other expenses, net, aggregated 125,000 in contrast to other (income), net, of 244,000)
during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense decreased to 144,000 during the three-month period ended September
30, 2024 from 145,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance and debt discount
costs (which is included as a component of interest expense) was 11,000 and 9,000 during the three-month periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income was 19,000 and 24,000 during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, we benefited from 365,000 of insurance recoveries, compared to
no such benefit during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, other expenses, net, aggregated 406,000 in contrast to other (income), net, of 113,000)
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense increased to 433,000 during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2024 from 323,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Non-cash amortization of debt issuance and debt discount
costs (which is included as a component of interest expense) was 32,000 and 13,000 during the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. We anticipate that our interest expense (excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance and debt discount
costs) will be approximately 524,000 and 452,000 during the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Interest income
was 41,000 and 79,000 during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We incurred a 15,000 loss on
disposal of property, plant and equipment during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to an 8,000 loss during the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, we benefited from 365,000 of insurance
recoveries, compared to no such benefit during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

h)
Loss Before Income Taxes 

During
the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, our loss before income taxes was 700,000 in comparison to a loss before income taxes
of 940,000 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 239,000 reduction in our loss before income taxes during the
three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 was largely the result of a 317,000
improvement in gross margin and a 332,000 decrease in product development expenses that were offset, in part, by a 370,000 swing from
other income to other expenses. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, our loss before income taxes was 2.7 million
in comparison to a loss before income taxes of 4.6 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The 2 million decrease
in our net loss during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was
largely the result of the 2.5 million increase in gross margin that was reduced by a 519,000 swing from other income during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2023 to other expenses during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 

i)
Income Taxes and Net Loss 

During
both of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of less than 2,000, which is comprised
of minimum state tax liabilities. Our net loss of 702,000, or 0.09 per basic share, during the three-month period ended September 30,
2024 was in comparison to net loss of 940,000, or 0.12 per basic share, during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. During
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded income tax expense of 4,000 and 3,000, respectively, which is
comprised of minimum state tax liabilities. Our net loss of 2.7 million, or 0.34 per basic share, during the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2024 was in comparison to net loss of 4.6 million, or 0.60 per basic share, during the nine-month period ended September
30, 2023. 

We
have substantial net operating loss carryforwards that will largely offset future income tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, our
federal net operating loss carryforward was 17.8 million. As of December 31, 2023, our state net operating loss carryforward was 4.7
million. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation made significant changes in the U.S. tax
laws, including a reduction in the corporate tax rates, changes to net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks, and a repeal of the
corporate alternative minimum tax. The legislation reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 34 to 21 . Our income tax rate differs from
this statutory tax rate primarily because we are currently providing for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
While we are recording this full valuation allowance, we are not recognizing the benefit of our tax losses. 

In
addition to the results discussed above from our Statements of Operations, we believe it is important to consider our Statements of Cash
Flows in the accompanying unaudited financial statements and the discussion under Liquidity and Capital Resources , above, to assess
the cash generating ability of our operations.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
unaudited financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States.
All professional accounting standards that were effective and applicable to us as of September 30, 2024 have been taken into consideration
in preparing the financial statements. The preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. Significant estimates include our valuation of inventory, deferred tax assets and costs of
goods sold. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We
have chosen to highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of our business and understanding of our financial
statements. These critical accounting estimates have been consistently applied. 

We
sell products that provide Immediate Immunity to newborn dairy and beef cattle. We recognize revenue in accordance with
the five step model in ASC 606. These include the following: i) identification of the contract with the customer, ii) identification
of the performance obligations in the contract, iii) determination of the transaction price, iv) allocation of the transaction price
to the separate performance obligations in the contract and v) recognition of revenue associated with performance obligations as they
are satisfied. We recognize revenue at the time of shipment (including to distributors) for substantially all products, as title and
risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier after concluding that collectability is reasonably assured. We do
not bill for or collect sales tax because our sales are generally made to distributors and thus our sales to them are not subject to
sales tax. We generally have experienced an immaterial amount of product returns.	 

Inventory
includes raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost, on the first-in, first-out method, or
net realizable value (determined as the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal and transportation). Work-in-process and finished goods inventories include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.
Inventory is a critical accounting policy because of the estimates and assumptions used by management to determine its cost accounting
and because of the variability of the cost per dose due to fluctuations in the biological yield.

ITEM
4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures: Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, with the participation of the individual who
serves as our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of
September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, that officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
that date. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting: Our principal executive and principal financial officer and our Director of Finance
and Administration periodically evaluate any change in internal control over financial reporting which has occurred during the prior
fiscal quarter. We have concluded that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

In the ordinary course of business, we may become
subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims. Although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of any such lawsuits,
investigations and claims against us, we do not believe that any pending or threatened legal proceedings to which we are or could become
a party will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

Financial Risks 

Gross margin on product sales: One of
our goals is to achieve a gross margin as a percentage of total sales of 40 or more (including depreciation expense) after the initial
launch of new products. Depreciation expense will be a larger component of costs of goods sold for Re-Tain than
it is for the First Defense product line. Gross margins generally improve over time, but this anticipated improvement
may not be realized for Re-Tain . Many factors discussed in this Quarterly Report (including contaminations, process
yields, inflation, cost increases, supply-chain disruptions and the rising price of oil and other commodities and supplies) impact our
costs of goods sold. There is a risk that we are not able to achieve our gross margin goal, which would adversely affect our operating
results and could impact our future operating plans. We missed our gross margin goal during the year ended December 31, 2023 and during
the first nine months of 2024 with realized gross margins of 22 and 27 , respectively. There is a risk that our plans to maintain or
improve our gross margin may not be realized due to cost increases, production yield losses, additional manufacturing contamination events,
production equipment failures, price inelasticity or any combination of these factors. In addition, such negative events, depending on
their severity, could deplete our cash resulting in an inability to fund our business. 

Exposure to interest rates and debt service obligations: 
Rising interest rates could negatively affect the operating costs of dairy and beef producers and thus put further financial pressure
on an already stressed business sector, which could indirectly, but materially and adversely, affect our business. During the first quarter
of 2020, we removed the direct aspect of this particular exposure to our business by refinancing our bank debt (with the exception of
our line of credit) with fixed rate notes. Our mortgage debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 was 5.7 million bearing interest at
the fixed rate of 3.53 per annum. Our equipment loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were 2.1 million bearing interest at the
fixed rate of 3.50 per annum. The outstanding balance on the two State of Maine loans as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 633,000
bearing interest at the fixed rate of 5 per annum. The 3 million in debt that we secured during the third quarter of 2023 bears interest
at the blended fixed rate of 7.33 per annum and had an outstanding balance of 2.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Our outstanding
debt as of September 30, 2024 aggregating 11 million (gross of debt issuance and debt discount costs) bears interest at the blended fixed
rate of 4.51 per annum. Increasing interest rates would negatively impact the cost of any future borrowings. This was experienced on
the new debt facilities aggregating 3 million that we closed during the third quarter of 2023. A decline in sales or gross margin, coupled
with this debt service burden, could impair our ability to fund our capital and operating needs and objectives. The additional debt we
incurred to fund our growth objectives has significantly increased our total debt service costs. We are obligated to make principal and
interest payments aggregating approximately 2 million during both of the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025. See Note 10 to the
accompanying unaudited financial statements for more details about our debt.

Bank and the Finance Authority of Maine is subject to certain financial covenants. We are required to meet a minimum debt service coverage
(DSC) ratio of 1.35. Our actual DSC ratios were (1.10), 0.44, 2.68 and 2.03 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Our actual DSC ratio was (0.08) for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024. During the first quarter
of 2023, the DSC ratio covenant for the year ending December 31, 2023 was preemptively waived by our lender. Instead, we were required
to meet a minimum DSC ratio requirement of 1.35 for the twelve-month periods ending June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2024, and then again annually after that. During the first quarter of 2024, the DSC ratio covenant for the twelve-month period ended June
30, 2024 was preemptively waived by our lenders. During the third quarter of 2024, the DSC ratio covenant for the twelve-month period
ended September 30, 2024 was preemptively waived by our lenders. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the DSC ratio covenant for the twelve-month
period ending December 31, 2024 was preemptively waived by our lenders. Our next compliance obligation is for the year ending December
31, 2025. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve the required DSC ratio going forward. If we are unable to do so or reach
a favorable agreement with our lenders regarding that requirement (including an amendment to or waiver of such requirement), we would
be in violation of that covenant, which could result in unfavorable amendments to the terms of our bank debt or have other adverse impacts
on our business and results of operations. 

Currency
exchange fluctuation: We do not believe that currency exchange rates have had a significant effect on our revenues and expenses.
However, future increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could affect our customers and the demand for our products. We hope to increase
the level of our future sales of products outside the United States. The cost of our products to international customers could be affected
by currency fluctuations. The decline of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could make our products less expensive to international
customers. Conversely, a stronger U.S. dollar could make our products more costly for international customers. A weaker U.S. dollar makes
international purchases more expensive for us. 

Inflation, supply disruptions, tax rates and
economic downturns: Inflation is having a material and adverse impact on almost all supplies we purchase and labor we hire and retain.
Continuing or increasing inflationary trends could materially reduce our gross margin on product sales if we are unable or unwilling to
impose offsetting price increases on our customers. The extent and duration of the negative impact on the economics of our customers and
on the demand for our products going forward are very difficult to assess. The dairy market, similar to many others, has been unstable
as a result of the pandemic. The price paid to producers for milk has been very volatile. The Class III milk price has been extremely
volatile since the onset of the pandemic. Market conditions have improved somewhat, but this volatility remains a concern. Additionally,
like most input costs, the cost of grain and other feed is rising, which puts a strain on the profitability of our customers. There is
also economic uncertainty for beef producers, as the supply chain is interrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to closures of processing
plants and reduced throughput. This is a very unusual situation for farmers who work so hard to improve production quality and efficiency
in order to help feed a growing population with high-quality and cost-effective proteins. The pandemic created risk and continues to create
uncertainty and challenges for us and has created or contributed to global supply-chain disruptions and has affected international trade,
while creating a worldwide health and economic crisis. Stock market valuations have declined and recovered somewhat but remain very volatile.
Inflation has increased significantly, and tax rates may increase. There is a risk of a period of economic downturn, the severity and
duration of which are difficult to know. Prior to the pandemic and the responsive federal economic stimulus programs, many feared the
United States had taken on too much national debt. Now the debt load is significantly higher. A combination of the conditions, trends
and concerns summarized above could have a corresponding negative effect on our business and operations, including the supply of the colostrum
we purchase to produce our First Defense product line, the demand for our products in the U.S. market and our ability
to penetrate or maintain a profitable presence in international markets. Our exposure to this risk is mitigated to some extent by the
fact that our supply chain is not heavily dependent on foreign manufacturers, by our on-going cross-training of our employees, by qualifying
alternate suppliers and components and by our early and continued compliance with recommended hygiene. 

Projection of net (loss) income: Generally
speaking, our financial performance can differ significantly from management projections, due to numerous factors that are difficult to
predict or that are beyond our control. Weaker than expected sales of the First Defense product line could lead
to deeper operating losses or less profits. The timing of FDA approval of Re-Tain will have a material impact on
our net (loss) income until sufficient commercial sales are generated and sustained, unless we adequately reduce product development expenses. 

Risks associated with our funding strategy
for Re-Tain : The inability to maintain adequate cash and liquidity to support the commercialization
of Re-Tain is a risk to our business. Achieving FDA approval of our pharmaceutical-grade Nisin produced at commercial-scale
is the most critical action remaining in front of us on our path to U.S. regulatory approval of Re-Tain . Having
completed the construction and equipping of the DS production facility (as described in more detail in PART I: ITEM 2 of this Quarterly
Report) at a cost of approximately 20.8 million, we will continue to incur product development expenses to operate and maintain this
facility until commercialization, although we are reducing these expenses now that production of inventory for our Controlled Launch is
complete.

Uncertainty of market size and product sales
estimates: Estimating the size of the total addressable market and future sales growth potential for our First Defense 
product line is based on our experience and understanding of market dynamics but is inherently subjective. Estimating the size of the
market for any new product, such as Re-Tain , involves more uncertainties than do projections for established products.
We do not know whether, or to what extent, our products will achieve, maintain or increase market acceptance and profitability. Some of
the uncertainties surrounding Re-Tain include the product s effectiveness against currently prevalent pathogens,
market acceptance, the effect of a premium selling price on market penetration, cost of manufacture, competition from new and existing
products sold by substantially larger competitors with greater market reach and promotional resources and other risks described under
 Product Risks Sales risks pertaining to Re-Tain below. Since Re-Tain 
is a novel approach to treating mastitis, there are many uncertainties with regards to how quickly and to what extent we can develop the
subclinical mastitis treatment market. We believe that polypeptide antimicrobial technology may be viewed positively (relative to traditional
antibiotics). If realized, this may offset some of these risks and result in better overall market acceptance. 

Net deferred tax assets: The realizability
of our net deferred tax assets is a subjective estimate that is contingent upon many variables. During the second quarter of 2018, we
recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets that significantly increased our net loss in comparison to other
periods. This non-cash expense could be reversed, and this valuation allowance could be reduced or eliminated, if warranted by our actual
and projected profitability in the future. We will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance each quarter. 

Product Risks 

Product risks generally: We set objectives
for our products that we believe we can achieve, but the achievement of such goals is not a certainty. The sale of our products is subject
to production, financial, efficacy, regulatory, competitive and other market risks. Elevated standards to achieve and maintain regulatory
compliance required to sell our products continue to evolve. Failure to achieve acceptable biological yields from our production processes
can materially increase our costs of goods sold and reduce our production output, leading to lower margins and/or an order backlog that
could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results. First Defense is sold, and we expect Re-Tain 
to be sold, at significant price premiums relative to competitive products. There is no assurance that we will continue to achieve market
acceptance of the First Defense product line, or achieve and sustain market acceptance of Re-Tain ,
at a profitable price level or that we can continue to manufacture our products at a low enough cost to result in a sufficient gross margin
to justify their continued manufacture and sale. As we bring Re-Tain to market, these risks could be heightened
by the additional uncertainties associated with introducing a new product requiring a shift in customer behavior. 

Contamination events, equipment failures and
gross margin from our production process: During the first three and a half months of 2024 as well as during 2023 and late 2022, we
experienced certain contamination events and equipment failures in our production process that resulted in scrapped inventory and a slowdown
of our production process, which had a significant negative impact on our operating results. The realization of this risk following the
contamination events discussed above did result in a slowdown of our production output during 2023 to remediate this problem, which led
to less sales and gross margin during the year. We are at risk of further such production contaminations or equipment failures resulting
in more scrapped inventory. Additional contamination events or equipment failures causing significantly less production output, depending
on their severity, could deplete our cash resulting in an inability to fund our business operations. 

Sales
risks pertaining to Re-Tain : Actual
or prospective Re-Tain customers may decide
to discontinue, reduce or avoid usage of Re-Tain due
to the following risks: 

1)
A rejection of a tank of milk by a positive milk inhibitor test because too much of the milk in a bulk tank is comprised of milk from
cows being treated with Re-Tain , when tested
randomly for inhibitors by a milk hauler, which could create legal liability. 

2) A failed or stalled cheese tank occurs when
a Nisin susceptible cheese starter culture is impacted by residues in milk that exceed our on-farm treatment recommendations, which aims
to limit concentrations of bulk tanks or tankers to 1 of milk from cows treated with Re-Tain or is not effectively
diluted through the milk collection and transportation system. After we study this potential impact during our Controlled Launch of Re-Tain ,
we may decide to seek a post-approval label change requiring a short discard of milk, which may be limited to just the treated quarter
of the cow. 

50 

ImmuCell Corporation 

3)
Producers current practice generally is to treat only clinical mastitis, which has the visual indicator of abnormal milk. In order
to gain market penetration for Re-Tain , we will need to change that practice and increase awareness of the importance
of treating subclinical disease. This will require the producers ability and willingness to diagnose without visual indicators.
Users of Re-Tain could have unsatisfactory treatment outcomes if they lack the equipment needed to measure and
monitor somatic cell counts (SCC) of the herd or individual cows (for which data is needed). This risk limits our access to treatment
cows because about 40 of farms do not presently have access to this kind of testing at the cow level, and thus are not good candidates
for the use of Re-Tain . 

4) Lower than anticipated treatment cure rates
could be experienced because the product is administered to cows that we would not identify as the best treatment candidates based on
SCC data or because the product is administered to cows that are infected with pathogens outside of our label claims. 

5) Off-label use of our product in cows infected
with clinical mastitis before we have run the required studies and achieved a label claim extension for this disease state, resulting
in negative treatment outcomes and potential legal liability. 

6) Producers either do not choose to use it or
might use it improperly, rather than follow our label instructions to administer one dose after each of three consecutive milkings, or
they may limit use within the herd in an abundance of caution to avoid the negative outcomes described above. 

7) Based on the anticipated product expiration
dating for Re-Tain , we project that we will not have inventory available for sale after the first quarter of 2026
unless we secure additional DP supply following the November 30, 2024 expiration of our agreement with our current DP contract manufacturer. 

Reliance on sales of the First Defense 
product line: We are reliant on the market acceptance of the First Defense product line to generate product
sales and fund our operations. Our business would not have been profitable during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016,
during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 or during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019, December 31, 2020, June
30, 2021, September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 without the gross margin that we earned on sales of the First Defense 
product line. Our anticipated return to profitability is contingent upon the gross margin we earn from First Defense 
and prudent management of product development expenses. 

Concentration of sales: Sales of the First
Defense product line aggregated 99 of our total product sales during both of the years ended December 31, 2023 and
2022 and during both of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our primary customers for the majority of our product
sales (91 and 92 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 88 and 90 during the nine-month periods ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively) are in the U.S. dairy and beef industries. The concentration of our sales from one product
into just two markets (the dairy and beef markets) is a risk to our business. The animal health distribution segment has been aggressively
consolidating over the last few years, with larger distributors acquiring smaller distributors. A large portion of our product sales (79 
and 73 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 77 and 79 during the nine-month periods ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively) was made to two large distributors. A large portion of our trade accounts receivable (70 and 79 as
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) was due from these two distributors. We have a good history with these distributors,
but the concentration of sales and accounts receivable with a small number of customers does present a risk to us, including risks related
to such customers experiencing financial difficulties or altering the basis on which they do business with us in a manner unfavorable
to us. 

Production capacity constraints: We invested
 9.7 million from 2019 to September 30, 2024 to increase our production capacity (in terms of annual sales dollars) for the First Defense 
product line from approximately 16.5 million to approximately 30 million based on current selling prices and estimated production yields.
We are making initial plans to further increase our production capacity. While previous capacity expansion investments have proceeded
very close to budget, there is a risk of cost overruns in our ongoing projects and any future production expansions that we may undertake,
and a risk that we will not be able to achieve our production capacity growth objectives on a timely basis, resulting in a continuing
or increasing shortfall in supply to the market. The inability to meet market demand for our products is a risk to our business. The historically
large backlog of orders, as well as any ongoing order backlog, presents a risk that we could lose customers during this period that are
not easily regained thereafter, when our production capacity is expected to meet or exceed sales demand. Our long-term capital plan to
continue to expand the First Defense product line requires ongoing review of equipment capacity and utilization
across the manufacturing value stream at Building 56 and our leased facilities at Building 175A and 175B , as well
as assessment of costs, functional obsolescence and reliability of equipment. This review and assessment could identify a need to fund
unexpected equipment maintenance or replacement costs. 

Product liability: The manufacture and
sale of our products entails a risk of product liability. Our exposure to product liability is mitigated to some extent by the fact that
our products are directed towards the animal health market. We have maintained product liability insurance in an amount which we believe
is reasonable in relation to our potential exposure in this area. We have no history of claims of this nature being made.

Regulatory Risks 

Regulatory requirements for the First Defense 
product line: First Defense is sold in the United States subject to a product license from the Center for Veterinary
Biologics, USDA, which was first obtained in 1991, with subsequent approvals of line extensions in 2017 and 2018. As a result, our operations
are subject to periodic inspection by the USDA, and we are at risk of an unfavorable outcome from such inspections. The potency of serial
lots is directly traceable to the original serial used to obtain the product performance claims (the Reference Standard). Due to the unique
nature of the label claims, host animal re-testing is not required as long as periodic laboratory analyses continue to support the stability
of stored Reference Standard. To date, these analyses have demonstrated strong stability. However, if the USDA were not to approve requalification
of the Reference Standard, additional clinical studies could be required to meet regulatory requirements and allow for continued sales
of the product, which could interrupt sales and adversely affect our operating results. Territories outside of the United States may require
additional regulatory oversight that we may not be able to meet with our current facilities, processes and resources. There is a risk
that we will become subject to regulatory actions in the future, including actions that result in our inability to ship product. In these
cases, the resulting interruption in sales could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results. 

Regulatory requirements for Re-Tain :
 The commercial introduction of this product in the United States requires us to obtain FDA approval. Completing the development through
to approval of the NADA by the FDA involves risk. While four of the five required Technical Sections have been approved, the regulatory
development process timeline has been extensive (approximately 17 years from when the product rights were returned to us by a former partner
in 2007) and has involved multiple commercial production strategies and multiple submissions of the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls
(CMC) Technical Section. We received an Incomplete Letter from the FDA regarding this CMC Technical Section during the third quarter of
2022 that clarified the required path to product approval. During May of 2024, we received an Incomplete Letter from the FDA in response
to our November of 2023 re-submission. To reduce the risk associated with this process, we are working with a qualified contract manufacturer
(Norbrook) for alignment of the required validations and DP manufacture and have met with the FDA to clarify filing strategy and requirements.
Early during the first quarter of 2024, the FDA conducted another pre-approval inspection of our DS facility. This resulted in the issuance
of one deficiency as identified on the FDA s Form 483. Since then, we have cleared the inspectional observation with the FDA. However,
our efforts continue to be subject to inspection and approval by the FDA and other factors outside of our control, and there remains a
risk that the required FDA approvals of our product and facilities could be delayed or not obtained. The facility of our contract manufacturer
is subject to similar inspectional obligations and is currently working to resolve certain inspectional observations at their facility
with the FDA. International regulatory approvals would be required for sales of Re-Tain outside of the United States,
and there is a risk that these approvals would be or become too costly to pursue or be delayed or not obtained. 

Regulatory requirements limiting access to
suppliers and customer base : Maine, where our principal executive office and manufacturing facilities are located, has adopted product
reporting and phase-out requirements for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS ). Maine s statute establishes a
phased ban for products that contain intentionally added PFAS, with all products (subject to certain exceptions) other than cooling, heating,
ventilation, air conditioning or refrigeration equipment being banned by 2032 unless the Maine Department of Environmental Protection DEP has determined that the use of PFAS within the product is a currently unavoidable use. Beginning January
1, 2032, the sale of products containing intentionally added but currently unavoidable PFAS also is banned if the manufacturer
of such products has failed to report to the DEP information concerning the presence of PFAS in those products. The phased bans may limit
our ability to access supplies and may limit those customers to whom we may sell our products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
also has adopted a PFAS reporting law, which requires that importers of articles that contain PFAS report the presence of such substances
to the extent such information is known or reasonably ascertainable. This reporting requirement may limit our ability to import supplies. 

Economic Risks Pertaining to the Dairy and Beef Industries 

The industry data referred to below is compiled
from USDA databases. 

Cattle count: The January count of all
cattle and calves in the United States had steadily declined from 97,000,000 as of January 1, 2007 to 88,500,000 as of January 1, 2014.
Then this figure increased each year, reaching 94,800,000 as of January 1, 2019 before declining to 93,800,000 as of both January 1, 2020
and January 1, 2021. This count continued to decline to 92,100,000 as of January 1, 2022 and to 88,800,000 as of January 1, 2023. This
count dropped to 87,200,000 as of January 1, 2024. Reflecting seasonal trends, this figure was equal to 102,000,000, 101,000,000, 98,600,000
and 95,900,000 as of July 1, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. A significant decline in the cattle count could negatively affect
the size of our addressable market.

Herd size: Prior to 1957, there were over
20,000,000 cows in the U.S. dairy herd. Prior to 1986, there were over 10,000,000 cows in the U.S. dairy herd. From 1998 through 2021,
the size (annual average) of the U.S. dairy herd ranged from the low of 9,011,000 in 2004 to the high of 9,448,000 in 2021. This average
declined to 9,402,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022 and then declined to 9,386,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023.
This average declined slightly to 9,330,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. A significant decline in the herd size
could negatively affect the size of our addressable market. 

Milk cow price: The all-time high value
(annual average) for a milk cow was 1,993 during 2015. Since then, this annual average value steadily declined to 1,205 during 2019
before increasing to 1,300 during 2020 and to 1,363 during 2021. This price for 2022 increased significantly to an average of 1,598,
which is a 17 increase over 2021. The 2023 average price of 1,763 represents a 10 increase over prior year. This year-to-date average
price increased to 2,243 through October of 2024. A significant decline in the milk cow price could negatively affect the size of our
addressable market. 

Milk price: The dairy market, similar
to many others, has been unstable for several reasons including as a result of the pandemic. The price paid to producers for milk has
been very volatile. This market volatility, and the resulting impact on our primary end users, could negatively impact our ability to
maintain and grow sales at a profitable level. The Class III milk price (an industry benchmark that reflects the value of product used
to make cheese) is an important indicator because it defines our customers revenue level. This annual average milk price level
(measured in dollars per hundred pounds of milk) reached its highest point (since these prices were first reported in 1980) during 2014
at 22.34 (peaking at 24.60 in September of 2014), which price level has never been repeated. During the year ended December 31, 2020,
this average milk price was equal to 18.16, but it was extremely volatile during the year due largely to disruption in demand related
to the COVID-19 pandemic. The one-month fluctuation of 73 from a low of 12.14 in May of 2020 to 21.04 in June of 2020 set an all-time
record for variability. The average price for 2021 decreased by 6 to 17.08. This price average increased by 29 to 21.96 during the
year ended December 31, 2022. The average price decreased by 22 to 17.02 during the year ended December 31, 2023. The average price
increased by 11 to 18.82 during the ten-month period ended October 31, 2024. The annual fluctuations in this milk price level are demonstrated
in the following table:

Feed Costs: The actual level of milk prices
may be less important than its level relative to feed costs. One measure of this relationship is known as the milk-to-feed price ratio,
which represents the amount of feed that one pound of milk can buy. An increase in feed costs also has a negative impact on the beef industry
and therefore could have a resulting negative impact on our business and results of operations. This ratio varies farm-to-farm based on
individual operating parameters. Since this ratio reached 3.24 in 2005, it has not exceeded 3.00. This ratio averaged 1.74 for 2021, amounting
to a significant decline of 25 from the 2020 average of 2.32. This average has not been lower since 2012. During 2022, this ratio improved
by 10 to 1.91. This ratio dropped to 1.68 during the year ended December 31, 2023. This ratio increased to 2.37 during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024. The following table demonstrates the annual volatility and the low values of this ratio recently:

Market volatility : While the number of
cows in the U.S. herd and the production of milk per cow directly influence the supply of milk, the price for milk is also influenced
by very volatile international demand for milk products. Given our focus on the dairy and beef industries, the volatile market conditions
and the resulting financial insecurities of our primary end users are risks to our ability to maintain and grow sales at a profitable
level. These factors also heighten the challenge of selling premium-priced animal health products (such as Tri-Shield 
and Re-Tain into the dairy market. 

Small Size of the Company 

Dependence on key personnel: We are a
small company with approximately 79 employees (including 5 part-time employees). As such, we rely on certain key employees to support
multiple operational functions, with limited redundancy in capacity. The loss of any of these key employees could adversely affect our
operations until a qualified replacement is hired and trained, which could be even more challenging in the present difficult labor market.
Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract, retain and motivate key scientific, manufacturing, managerial
and sales and marketing personnel. The cost of attracting and retaining the needed additional personnel in this current job market and
inflationary environment could adversely affect our margins and profitability. 

Reliance on outside party to provide certain
services under contract for us: We are exposed to additional regulatory compliance risks through the subcontractors that we choose
to work with to produce Re-Tain , who also need to satisfy certain regulatory requirements in order to provide us
with the products and services we need. One example of this outside reliance is Norbrook, our DP contract manufacturer. Because Norbrook
notified us of its intent to terminate its supply agreement with us, we initiated an investment of approximately 4 million during 2022
to construct and equip our own DP formulation and aseptic filling capability for Re-Tain in our existing DS facility.
Due to the loss in gross margin during 2023 caused by the slowdown in production output necessary to remediate product contamination events,
we have decided to defer spending of approximately 2 million of these funds for the near term. The objective of this investment is to
end our reliance on an outside party to perform these services for us. Actual project costs could exceed our current estimates. Completion
of this project could be delayed due to a number of factors outside our control, including delays in equipment fabrication, equipment
delivery or facility construction. In addition, there is a risk that we fail to achieve regulatory approval of the new facility or that
such approval is delayed or requires significant additional expenditures to obtain. We are evaluating alternatives for DP supply going
forward, which include the resumption of the investment in our own in-house DP services (when prudent based on our cash reserves) or another
contract manufacturing agreement or a further extension with Norbrook. We anticipate a supply interruption under our Controlled Launch
of Re-Tain after the DP supply provided from our contract manufacturer is consumed and until new supply from a
new contract manufacturing agreement or our own formulation and aseptic filling facility is implemented. 

Competition from others: Many of our competitors
are significantly larger and more diversified in the relevant markets than we are and have substantially greater financial, marketing,
manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development and sales/distribution capabilities than we do, including greater
ability to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and declining revenues and/or profitability. Merck and Zoetis, among other
companies, sell products that compete directly with the First Defense product line in preventing scours in newborn
calves. The scours product sold by Zoetis sells for approximately half the price of our product, although it does not have an E. coli 
claim (which ours does). With Tri-Shield , we can compete more effectively against vaccines that are given to the
mother cow (dam) to improve the quality of the colostrum that she produces for the newborn calf. Elanco, Merck and Zoetis provide these
dam vaccine products to the market. There are many companies competing in the mastitis treatment market, most notably Boehringer Ingelheim,
Merck and Zoetis. The mastitis products sold by these large companies are well established in the market and are priced lower than what
we expect for Re-Tain , but all of them involve traditional antibiotics and are sold subject to a requirement to
discard milk during and for a period of time after treatment (unlike our product which does not carry an FDA-required milk discard or
meat withhold). There is no assurance that our products will compete successfully in these markets. We may not be aware of other companies
that compete with us or intend to compete with us in the future.

of Ukraine and the war in the Middle East: Russia s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine (and attack on its people) and the
war in the Middle East are having a significant negative impact on the world economy, worsening trends that were already moving in an
unfavorable direction. Among other exposures, an increasing price of oil could impact our transportation-related expenses materially and
could increase the cost of petroleum-based products that we purchase (mostly plastics). Both of these military actions could cause more
stress on the global economy. 

Climate change: Our business, and our
activities and the activities of our customers and suppliers, could be disrupted by climate change. Potential physical risks from climate
change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires and
other natural disasters, rising sea levels, and a rising heat index, any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers 
and suppliers businesses. Increased temperatures and rising water levels may negatively impact our dairy and beef livestock customers
by increasing the prevalence of parasites and diseases that affect food animals. The physical changes caused by climate change may also
prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers 
businesses. Climate change may negatively impact our customers operations, through climate-related impacts such as increased air
and water temperatures, rising water levels and increased incidence of disease in livestock. In addition, concerns regarding greenhouse
gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts of livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming
animal products. If such events affect our customers businesses, they may purchase fewer of our products, and our revenues may
be negatively impacted. Climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our business and on
our customers. In addition, increased frequency of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions may disrupt our manufacturing processes
or our supply chain. These disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and/or cash flows. 

Bovine diseases: The potential for epidemics
of bovine diseases such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Foot and Mouth Disease, Bovine Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) presents a risk to us and our customers. Documented cases of BSE in the United States have led to an overall
tightening of regulations pertaining to ingredients of animal origin, especially bovine. The First Defense product
line is manufactured from concentrated bovine colostrum, which is not considered a BSE risk material. Future regulatory action to increase
protection of the human food supply could affect the First Defense product line, although presently we do not anticipate
that this will be the case. 

Risks Pertaining to Common Stock 

Stock market
valuation and liquidity: Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq: ICCC). Our average daily trading volume (which
was 44,808 shares per day during the 20-day period ended October 30, 2024) is lower, our bid/ask stock price spread can be larger and
our share price can be more volatile than what other companies experience, which could result in investors facing difficulty selling their
stock for proceeds that they may expect or desire. Our share price as of October 30, 2024 was 3.67. Most companies in the animal health
sector have market capitalization values that greatly exceed our market capitalization of approximately 32.7 million as of October 30,
2024. Our product sales during the trailing twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 23.8 million. This means that our market
capitalization as of October 30, 2024 was equal to approximately 1.4 times our sales during the trailing twelve-month period ended September
30, 2024. Before gross margin from the sale of new products is achieved, our market capitalization may be heavily dependent on the perceived
potential for growth from our product under development and may therefore be negatively affected by the related uncertainties and risks.

Certain
provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management: Provisions of our certificate
of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders
may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common
stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions
include: 

limitations
 on the removal of directors; 

advance
 notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; 

the
 ability of our Board of Directors to alter or repeal our bylaws; 

Section
 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation
 from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally defined
 as a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned,
 15 of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in
 which the person became an interested stockholder) unless the business combination is approved
 in a prescribed manner. 

The existence
of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could depress the trading price of our common stock or limit the price that investors
might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby
reducing the likelihood of obtaining a premium for our common stock in an acquisition. 

No expectation
to pay any dividends or repurchase stock for the foreseeable future: We do not anticipate paying any dividends to, or repurchasing
stock from, our stockholders for the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to use cash to fund product development costs and investments
in our facilities and production equipment, and to increase our working capital. Stockholders must be prepared to rely on market sales
of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Any determination to pay dividends
or repurchase stock in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition,
results of operations, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, current and anticipated needs for liquidity
and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. 

Possible
dilution: We are accessing the capital markets and issuing additional common stock under an At-The-Market Offering Agreement in order
to fund our operations, as described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Such issuances have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. 

Other Risks 

Access to raw materials and contract manufacturing
services: Our objective is to maintain more than one source of supply for the components used to manufacture and test our products
that we obtain from third parties. However, we may experience difficulty in efficiently acquiring essential supplies. We have significantly
increased the number of farms from which we purchase colostrum for the First Defense product line. A significant
reduction in farm capacity could make it difficult for us to produce enough inventory to meet customer demand. The specific antibodies
that we purify from colostrum for the First Defense product line are not readily available from other sources.
We are and will be dependent on our manufacturing facilities and operations in Portland for the production of the First Defense 
product line and Re-Tain . We will be dependent on one manufacturer for the supply of syringes for Re-Tain .
We are currently dependent on a contract with Norbrook for the DP formulation and aseptic filling for supply of our Nisin DP through 2024.
Any facility used to perform these services will be subject to FDA inspection and approval, the outcome and timing of which are not within
our control. We anticipate that this FDA approval process would take at least two years. The potential alternative options for these services
are narrowed considerably because our product cannot be formulated or filled in a facility that also processes traditional antibiotics
(i.e., beta lactams). Any significant damage to or other disruption in the services at any of these third-party facilities or our own
facilities (including due to lack of financing, regulatory issues or non-compliance) would adversely affect the production of inventory
and result in significant added expenses and potential loss of future sales. We anticipate a supply interruption and adverse effects on
our Controlled Launch of Re-Tain beginning during the first quarter of 2026 (subject to confirmation of final product
shelf-life disposition by the FDA). These goods represent the initial DP production from our contract manufacturer. The extent of the
interruption will be subject to the supply timeline from a new contract manufacturing agreement or from our own formulation and aseptic
filling facility for DP.

ImmuCell Corporation 

Failure to protect intellectual property:
 The protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights may require the expenditure of significant financial, managerial
and operational resources. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with
our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. However, we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property
rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to obtain registration
for all intellectual property we seek to register, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country
in which our products are sold. In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain
products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary
technology through trade secrets, operational safeguards and contractual agreements. Reliance upon trade secret, rather than patent protection
may cause us to be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate (knock off) our manufacturing techniques and processes. Further,
our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, technologies and processes and may
not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. Others may independently develop similar trade
secrets or technology or obtain access to our unpatented trade secrets or proprietary technology. Others may have filed patent applications
and may have been issued patents involving products or technologies potentially useful to us or necessary for us to commercialize our
products or achieve our business goals. If that were to be the case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses
to such patents on terms that are acceptable to us. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated
through administrative process or litigation. Third parties may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property
rights, which could result in significant costs and potential damages and license requirements. We may initiate claims or litigation against
others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights or to establish
the validity of such rights. However, we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any infringement, misappropriation or other
violation of our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. In addition, we may be unable to prevent third parties from
infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. 

Increasing dependence on the continuous and
reliable operation of our information technology systems: We rely on information systems throughout our company. Any disruption of
these systems or significant security breaches could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain information security policies
and employ system backup measures and engage in information system redundancy planning and processes, such policies, measures, planning
and processes, as well as our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities. As information
systems and the use of software and related applications by us, our business partners, suppliers, and customers become more cloud-based,
we become inherently more susceptible to cyberattacks. There has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats,
including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks
and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information. There are reports of increased activity by hackers and scammers
since the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia s unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine may elevate the risk of such cyberattacks. Any such
attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored thereon could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.
While we have invested in our data and information technology infrastructure (including working with an information security technology
consultant to assess and enhance our security systems and procedures, and periodically training our employees in such systems and procedures),
there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, the risk of system
disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains. We have not experienced any material adverse effect on our business or operations
as a consequence of any such attack or breach but may incur increasing costs in performing the tasks described above. Given the unpredictability
of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, which vary in technique and sources,
if we or our business partners or suppliers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach that impacts any of our
critical functions, or our customers were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach via any of our connected products
and services, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations.
Furthermore, any access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of data or information, including any of our (or our customers 
or suppliers confidential or proprietary information or personal data or information, as a result of an attack or security breach
could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in
our products and services, damage our ability to develop (and protect our rights to) our proprietary technologies and have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. While this exposure is common to all companies,
larger companies with greater resources may be better able to mitigate this risk than we can.
