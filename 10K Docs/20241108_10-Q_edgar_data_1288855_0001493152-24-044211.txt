(2)
 Debt Securities, Continued. 

At
September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the unrealized losses on investment debt securities in each period were attributable
to changes in interest rates. 

Management
evaluates debt securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to
determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently
when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) the financial condition and near-term prospects
of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, (2) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments,
(3) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (4) the intent and ability to retain its investment
in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is
more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, (5) the anticipated
outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, (6) credit ratings, (7) third party guarantees, and (8) collateral values.
In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government
or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition,
and the issuer s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. 

The
Company performed an analysis that determined that the mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and U.S.
government securities, and SBA pool securities have a zero expected credit loss as they have the full faith and credit backing of the
U.S. government or one of its agencies. Municipal bonds that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated at least
quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. At September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023 all municipal securities were rated as investment grade. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September
30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled and the Company does not believe that there is a credit loss or that credit loss expense
is necessary. Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow
for any anticipated recovery in the market, the Company considers our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position,
capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. The Company does not currently intend to sell the investments within the
portfolio, and it is not more-likely-than-not that a sale will be required. 

Management
continues to monitor all of our investments with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that in a future period, conditions
may exist at that time indicating that some or all of the Company s securities may be sold that would require a charge to earnings
as credit loss expense in such period.

 Loans, Continued. The Company has divided the loan portfolio into six portfolio segments, each with different risk characteristics
and methodologies for assessing risk. All loans are underwritten based upon standards set forth in the policies approved by the Bank s
Board of Directors. The Company identifies the portfolio segments as follows: 

(continued) 

OPTIMUMBANK
HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

(3)
 Loans, Continued. 

Residential
Real Estate, Multi-Family Real Estate, Commercial Real Estate, Land and Construction. Residential real estate loans are underwritten
based on repayment capacity and source, value of the underlying property, credit history and stability. The Company offers first and
second one-to-four family mortgage loans; the collateral for these loans is generally the clients owner-occupied residences. Although
these types of loans present lower levels of risk than commercial real estate loans, risks do still exist because of possible fluctuations
in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrowers financial condition. Multi-family
and commercial real estate loans are secured by the subject property. Underwriting standards include, among other factors, loan to value
limits, cash flow coverage and general creditworthiness of the obligors. Construction loans to borrowers finance the construction of
owner occupied and leased properties. These loans are categorized as construction loans during the construction period, later converting
to commercial or residential real estate loans after the construction is complete and amortization of the loan begins. Real estate development
and construction loans are approved based on an analysis of the borrower and guarantor, the viability of the project and an acceptable
percentage of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. Real estate development and construction loan funds are disbursed
periodically based on the percentage of construction completed. The Company carefully monitors these loans with on-site inspections and
requires the receipt of lien waivers on funds advanced. Development and construction loans are typically secured by the properties under
development or construction, and personal guarantees are typically obtained. Further, to assure that reliance is not placed solely on
the value of the underlying property, the Company considers the market conditions and feasibility of proposed projects, the financial
condition and reputation of the borrower and guarantors, the amount of the borrower s equity in the project, independent appraisals,
cost estimates and pre-construction sales information. The Company also makes loans on occasion for the purchase of land for future development
by the borrower. Land loans are extended for future development for either commercial or residential use by the borrower. The Company
carefully analyzes the intended use of the property and the viability thereof. 

Commercial.
 Commercial business loans and lines of credit consist of loans to small- and medium-sized companies. Commercial loans are generally
used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture. Primarily all of the Company s commercial
loans are secured loans, along with a small amount of unsecured loans. The Company s underwriting analysis consists of a review
of the financial statements of the borrower, the lending history of the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the
projected cash flows of the business, the value of the collateral, if any, and whether the loan is guaranteed by the principals of the
borrower. These loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Commercial loans are typically made on the
basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business, which makes them of higher
risk than residential loans and the collateral securing loans may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success
of the business. The Company mitigates these risks through its underwriting standards. 

Consumer.
 Consumer loans are extended for various purposes, including purchases of automobiles, recreational vehicles, and boats. Also
offered are home improvement loans, lines of credit, personal loans, and deposit account collateralized loans. Repayment of these loans
is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such
as unemployment levels. Loans to consumers are extended after a credit evaluation, including the creditworthiness of the borrower(s),
the purpose of the credit, and the secondary source of repayment. Consumer loans are made at fixed and variable interest rates. Risk
is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts.

 Loans, Continued. 

Internally
assigned loan grades are defined as follows: 

Pass
 a Pass loan s primary source of loan repayment is satisfactory, with secondary sources very likely to be realized if
 necessary. These are loans that conform in all aspects to bank policy and regulatory requirements, and no repayment risk has been
 identified. 

OLEM
 an Other Loan Especially Mentioned has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected,
 these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the Company s credit
 position at some future date. 

Substandard
 a Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral
 pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.
 Included in this category are loans that are current on their payments, but the Bank is unable to document the source of repayment.
 They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful
 a loan classified as Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified as Substandard, with the added characteristics
 that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly
 questionable and improbable. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather
 it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected
 in the future. The Company charges off any estimated loss on loans classified as Doubtful. 

Loss
 a loan classified Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.
 This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable
 to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future. The Company fully
 charges off any loan classified as loss.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere
in this report. For additional information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the year ended December
31, 2023, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act
of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and
uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including adverse changes in economic, political and market conditions,
losses from the Company s lending activities, increases in interest rates, the possible loss of key personnel, the impact of increasing
competition, the impact of changes in government regulation, the possibility of liabilities arising from violations of federal and state
securities laws and the impact of changes in technology in the banking industry. Although the Company believes that its forward-looking
statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding its business and future market conditions, there can be no assurances that
the Company s actual results will not differ materially from any results expressed or implied by the Company s forward-looking
statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise. Readers are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. 

Strategic
Plan 

Our
key strategic initiatives are designed to generate continued growth in earning assets, core transaction and savings deposits, treasury
management fee income, and lower costs. Continued emphasis on expansion of our footprint and exploring additional lines of business are
also part of our plans. 

Presently, 
we intend to continue to limit our growth in loans and other illiquid assets. Therefore, we do not expect a material increase in our
loan balances during the coming quarter. However, we expect to continue focus any loan growth on originating multi-family, non-owner
occupied, commercial real estate, and skilled nursing receivable facility loans. As to deposits, we are focused on increasing our
on-balance sheet liquidity by identifying deposit growth opportunities among our existing customer base and prospects throughout
Florida and the United States. With respect to treasury management, our focus will remain on merchant cash advance providers and the
related electronic funds transfer line of business. For this revenue source to increase further in a meaningful way, automation will
be necessary in order to further improve efficiency. We are currently investing in the necessary technology to achieve this
end. 

Going
forward, our strategic plan will be to continue to emphasize and build upon initiatives focused on strengthening internal controls, credit
oversight and credit administrative processes and procedures. Moreover, management continues to identify loan growth opportunities, subject
to the above caveat, that are designed to improve overall profitability without sacrificing credit quality and underwriting standards.
This strategic direction is expected to be facilitated by maintaining credit administration objectives including a risk-based and comprehensive
credit culture and a credit administrative infrastructure that reinforces appropriate risk management practices. 

During
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Bank commenced offering U.S. Small Business Administration SBA SBA
7A loans. SBA 7A loans are generally used to establish a new business or assist in the acquisition, operation, or expansion of an existing
business. With SBA loan programs, there are set eligibility requirements and underwriting standards outlined by SBA that can change as
the government alters its fiscal policy. These loans are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate.
The Bank hired two full-time SBA staff. At September 30, 2024, SBA 7A loans amounted to 4.7 million. The Bank sells the guaranteed portion
of the SBA loans. 

Additionally,
management has implemented initiatives that have enabled us to grow our loan portfolio primarily with locally generated relationships
in the non-owner occupied, multi-family and commercial real estate sectors. However, out-of-area loans and loan pool purchases will be
considered as deemed appropriate and subject to proper due diligence to further increase interest income and for portfolio diversification
purposes.

Financial
Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 

Overview 

The
Company s total assets increased by approximately 154 million to 945 million at September 30, 2024, from 791 million at December
31, 2023, primarily due to increases in loans, and cash and cash equivalents. The growth in assets was attributable to the success of
the Company s efforts to increase loans and deposits from new customers, predominantly in the first quarter. Net loans grew by
 98 million to 769 million at September 30, 2024, from 671 million at December 31, 2023. Deposits grew by approximately 167 million
to 807 million at September 30, 2024, from 640 million at December 31, 2023. Total stockholders equity increased by approximately
 23 million to 93 million at September 30, 2024, from 70 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to net earnings and proceeds from
common and preferred stock sales, and changes in unrealized losses on debt securities available for sale.

Net
earnings . Net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 3.3 million or .34 per basic share and .32 per
diluted share compared to net earnings of 1.3 million or .18 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase in net earnings during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily
attributed to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by the increase in interest expense and non-interest
expense. 

Interest
income . Interest income increased 6.4 million to 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest
income of 8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio and increases in yields
on interest earning assets. 

Interest
expense. Interest expense increased 3.4 million to 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to interest
expense of 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to interest bearing deposit rates and changes in the
composition and volume of deposits. 

Credit
loss expense. Expected credit loss expense was 357,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The expected credit loss expense is charged to earnings as losses are expected to have
occurred in order to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to absorb losses expected.
Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon historical experience, the volume
and type of lending conducted by us, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of the
underlying collateral, general economic conditions, particularly as they relate to our market areas, and other factors related to the
estimated collectability of our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses totaled 8.3 million or 1.07 of loans outstanding at
September 30, 2024, compared to 7.7 million or 1.13 of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023 .
The decrease in the credit loss expense during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to loan volume growth and the evaluation of
the other factors noted above. During the three-months ended September 30, 2024, the net charge offs amounting to 280,000 arose mostly
due to consumer lending for the three-month ended September 30, 2024. 

Noninterest
income. Total noninterest income increased 204,000 to 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 911,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased wire transfer and ACH fees during Third quarter of 2024.

Net
earnings . Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were 9.2 million or 1.02 per basic share and .98 per
diluted share compared to net earnings of 3.7 million or .52 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase in net earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily
attributed to an increase in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by the increase in interest expense and non-interest
expense. 

Interest
income . Interest income increased 19.4 million to 44 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to growth in the loan portfolio and increases in yields on interest earning assets. 

Interest
expense. Interest expense increased 10.5 million to 18.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in deposit rates and changes in the composition of deposits and
increase in the average balances. 

Credit
loss expense. Expected credit loss expense decreased 1.4 million to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The expected credit loss expense is charged to earnings as losses
are expected to have occurred in order to bring the total allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management to
absorb losses expected. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon historical
experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by the Company, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability
to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral, general economic conditions, particularly as they relate to our market areas,
and other factors related to the estimated collectability of our loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses totaled 8.3 million
or 1.07 of loans outstanding at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.7 million or 1.13 of loans outstanding at December 31, 2023. The
decrease in the credit loss expense during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to loan volume growth and the evaluation of the
other factors noted above. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, the net charge off amounting to 1.1 million resulted from
consumer lending. 

Noninterest
income. Total noninterest income increased to 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 2.4 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to increased wire transfer and ACH fees. 

Noninterest
expenses . Total noninterest expenses increased 4.1 million to 15.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
compared to 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to employee compensation and benefits, and data
processing.
