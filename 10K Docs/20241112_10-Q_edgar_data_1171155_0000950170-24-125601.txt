 operating locations. Included in these operating locations are a number of independent agents, who are also referred to as strategic operating partners, that operate exclusively on the Company s behalf, and approximately Company-owned locations. As the operator of a third-party logistics company, the Company has a vast carrier network of asset-based transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads, airlines and ocean lines in its carrier network. Through its operating locations across North America, the Company offers domestic and international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services, including truckload services, less than truckload services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. The Company s primary transportation services involve arranging shipments, on behalf of its customers, of materials, products, equipment, and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL and UPS, including arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. The Company also provides other value-added logistics services including materials management and distribution services (collectively, materials management and distribution or MM D services), and customs house brokerage CHB services to complement its core transportation service offering. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The Company s management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The interim period information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of the Company s management, necessary for a fair statement of the results of the respective interim periods. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for an entire year.

of interest payments on the Company s senior secured loan held by the lender that are required to be set aside. There is longer any restricted cash a s the senior secured loan was repaid in full during fiscal year 2024 . The Company combines unrestricted and restricted cash for presentation in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Through a contractual arrangement, the Company records trade accounts receivable from revenue generated from independently owned strategic operating partners operating under various Company brands. Under these contracts, each strategic operating partner is responsible for some or all of the collection of its customer accounts receivable. To facilitate this arrangement, certain strategic operating partners are required to maintain a deposit with the Company for these receivables. The Company charges the respective strategic operating partner s deposit account for any accounts receivable aged beyond 90 days along with any other amounts owed to the Company by strategic operating partners. If a deficit balance occurs in the strategic operating partners deposit account, these amounts are included as accounts receivable in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. For those strategic operating partners not required to maintain a deposit, the Company may withhold all or a portion of future commissions payable to the strategic operating partner to satisfy any deficit balance. The Company expects to replenish any deficit balance through the future business operations of these strategic operating partners, or as these amounts are ultimately collected from these customers. However, to the extent any of these strategic operating partners were to cease operations or otherwise be unable to replenish these deficit amounts, the Company would be at risk of loss for any such amounts. Due to the nature and specific risk characteristics of these accounts, the Company evaluates these accounts separately in determining an allowance for expected credit losses.

reporting units for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test. An entity first has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment evaluates various factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, recent events, and financial trends that may impact the fair value of the reporting unit. If it is determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, a quantitative assessment is required. Otherwise, no further analysis is required. If a quantitative assessment is performed, a reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying amount. A reporting unit s fair value is determined based upon consideration of various valuation methodologies, including the income approach, which utilizes projected future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the risks involved and the market approach, which utilizes multiples of current and future earnings based on a selection of guideline public companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. As of September 30, 2024 , management believes no impairment exists.

disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the period as the Company s contract with its transportation customers have an expected duration of one year or less. The corresponding direct costs of revenue, which primarily includes purchased transportation costs and commissions, have been expensed ratably as the goods are transferred to the customer. The Company also provides MM D services for its customers under contracts generally ranging from a few months to five years and include renewal provisions. These MM D service contracts provide for inventory management, order fulfillment and warehousing of the customer s product and arrangement of transportation of the customer s product. The Company s performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the services provided by the Company as it performs. Revenue is recognized in the amount for which the Company has the right to invoice the customer, as this amount corresponds directly with the value provided to the customer for the Company s performance completed to date. The transaction price is based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer and contains fixed and variable consideration. In general, the fixed consideration component of a contract represents reimbursement for facility and equipment costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligation and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The variable consideration component is comprised of cost reimbursement per unit pricing for time and pricing for materials used and is determined based on cost plus a mark-up for hours of services provided and materials used and is recognized over time based on the level of activity volume. Other services include primarily CHB services sold separately as a single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from this performance obligation at a point in time, which is the completion of the services. Duties and taxes collected from the customer and paid to the customs agent on behalf of the customers are excluded from revenue. The Company uses independent contractors and third-party carriers in the performance of its transportation services. The Company evaluates who controls the transportation services to determine whether its performance obligation is to transfer services to the customer or to arrange for services to be provided by another party. The Company determined it acts as the principal for its transportation services performance obligation since it is in control of establishing the prices for the specified services, managing all aspects of the shipments process and assuming the risk of loss for delivery and collection. Such transportation services revenue is presented on a gross basis in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

The net payment obligation is based on the notional amount of the swap contracts and the prevailing market interest rates. The Company may terminate the swap contracts prior to their expiration, at which point a realized gain or loss would be recognized. The value of the Company s commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the extent to which interest rates move against the rate fixed for each swap. The derivative instruments had a total notional amount of and a fair value of and recorded in deposits and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Neither interest rate swap contract is designated as a hedge, and gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. See Note 12 for discussion of fair value of the derivative instruments.

shares of the Company s common stock through . In February 2022, the Company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to shares of the Company s common stock through . Under the stock repurchase programs, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or through privately negotiated transactions as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. The programs do not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and could be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. Under these repurchase programs, the Company purchased shares of its common stock at an average cost of per share for an aggregate cost of , and shares of its common stock at an average cost of per share for an aggregate cost of during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 

 by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and by RCP, a company for which the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is the sole member. RLP is a certified minority business enterprise that was formed for the purpose of providing the Company with a national accounts strategy to pursue corporate and government accounts with diversity initiatives. RCP s ownership interest entitles it to of the profits and distributable cash, if any, generated by RLP. The operations of RLP are intended to provide certain benefits to the Company, including expanding the scope of services offered by the Company and participating in supplier diversity programs not otherwise available to the Company. In the course of evaluating and approving the ownership structure, operations and economics emanating from RLP, a committee consisting of the independent Board members of the Company, considered, among other factors, the significant benefits provided to the Company through association with a minority business enterprise, particularly as many of the Company s largest current and potential customers have a need for diversity offerings. In addition, the committee concluded that the economic relationship with RLP was on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms generally available from unaffiliated third parties. Certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties are considered variable interest entities. The Company has power over significant activities of RLP including the fulfillment of its contracts and financing its operations. Additionally, the Company also pays expenses and collects receivables on behalf of RLP. Thus, the Company is the primary beneficiary, RLP qualifies as a variable interest entity, and RLP is consolidated in these condensed consolidated financial statements. RLP recorded and in net income of which RCP s distributable share was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The non-controlling interest recorded as a reduction of net income available to common stockholders in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income represents RCP s distributive share.

The Company has contingent obligations to transfer cash payments to former shareholders of acquired operations in conjunction with certain acquisitions if specified operating results and financial objectives are met over their stated earn-out period. Contingent consideration is measured quarterly at fair value, and any change in the fair value of the contingent liability is included in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The change in fair value in each period is principally attributable to a change in management s estimates of future earn-out payments through the remainder of the earn-out periods. The Company uses projected future financial results based on recent and historical data to value the anticipated future earn-out payments. To calculate fair value, the future earn-out payments were then discounted using Level 3 inputs. The Company has classified the contingent consideration as Level 3 due to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs. The Company believes the discount rate used to discount the earn-out payments reflects market participant assumptions. Changes in assumptions and operating results could have a significant impact on the earn-out amount up to a maximum of through earn-out periods measured through January 2027. As discussed in Note 9, derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair market value of interest rate swaps are determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs, specifically a pricing service proprietary to Bank of America. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the Company s cash equivalents, receivables, contract assets, accounts payable, commissions payable, accrued expenses, and the income tax receivable and payable approximate the fair values due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company s Revolving Credit Facility and notes payable would not differ significantly from fair value (based on Level 2 inputs) if recalculated based on current interest rates. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , there were transfers of financial instruments between Levels 1, 2, and 3.

 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning set forth in United States securities laws and regulations that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business, financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as anticipate, believe, estimates, expect, future, intend, may, plan, see, seek, strategy, or will or the negative thereof or any variation thereon or similar terminology or expressions. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We have developed our forward-looking statements based on management s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn rely upon information available to them at the time such statements were made. Such forward-looking statements reflect our current perspectives on our business, future performance, existing trends and information as of the date of this report. These include, but are not limited to, our beliefs about future revenue and expense levels, growth rates, prospects related to our strategic initiatives and business strategies, along with express or implied assumptions about, among other things: our continued relationships with our strategic operating partners; the performance of our historic business, as well as the businesses we have recently acquired, at levels consistent with recent trends and reflective of the synergies we believe will be available to us as a result of such acquisitions; our ability to successfully integrate our recently acquired businesses; our ability to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and secure the financing necessary to complete such acquisitions; transportation costs remaining in-line with recent levels and expected trends; our ability to mitigate, to the best extent possible, our dependence on current management and certain larger strategic operating partners; our compliance with financial and other covenants under our indebtedness; the absence of any adverse laws or governmental regulations affecting the transportation industry in general, and our operations in particular; our ability to continue to respond to macroeconomic factors that have recently had a negative effect on worldwide freight markets; the impact of any health pandemic or environmental event on our operations and financial results; continued disruptions in the global supply chain; higher inflationary pressures particularly surrounding the costs of fuel, labor, and other components of our operations; potential adverse legal, reputational and financial effects on the Company resulting from the cybersecurity incident that we reported in March 2024 or future cyber incidents and the effectiveness of the Company s business continuity plans in response to cyber incidents; the commercial, reputational and regulatory risks to our business that may arise as a consequence of our inability to remediate during fiscal year 2024 a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, and the further risks that may arise should we be unable to remediate that material weakness during fiscal year 2025; and such other factors that may be identified from time to time in our U.S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings and other public announcements including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors in Part 1 Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report. 
 Overview 
 Radiant Logistics, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Company, we or us ), operates as a leading third-party logistics company, providing technology-enabled global transportation and value-added logistics solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. We service a large, broad, and diversified account base consisting of consumer goods, food and beverage, electronics and high-tech, aviation and automotive, military and government, and manufacturing and retail customers, which is supported by an extensive network of operating locations across North America as well as an integrated international service partner network located in other key markets around the globe. The Company provides these services through a multi-brand network, which includes over 100 operating locations. Included in these operating locations are a number of independent agents, who are also referred to as strategic operating partners, that operate exclusively on the Company's behalf, and approximately 30 Company-owned locations. As the operator of a third-party logistics business, the Company has a vast carrier network of asset-based transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads, airlines and ocean lines in its carrier network. We believe shippers value our services because we are able to objectively arrange the most efficient and cost-effective means, type and provider of transportation service without undue influence caused by the ownership of transportation assets. In addition, our minimal investment in physical assets affords us the opportunity for a higher return on invested capital and net cash flows than our asset-based competitors. 
 Through our operating locations across North America, we offer domestic, international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services, including truckload services, less than truckload LTL services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. Our primary business operations involve arranging the shipment, on behalf of our customers, of materials, products, equipment, and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL, and UPS, including arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We also provide other value-added logistics services including materials management and distribution services (collectively, materials management and distribution or MM D services), customs house brokerage CHB services and global trade management GTM services to complement our core transportation service offering. 
 The Company expects to grow its business organically and by completing acquisitions of other companies with complementary geographical and logistics service offerings. The Company s organic growth strategy will continue to focus on strengthening existing and expanding new customer relationships leveraging the benefit of the Company s technology platform, while continuing its efforts on the organic build-out of the Company s network of strategic operating partner locations. In addition, as the Company continues to grow and scale its business, the Company believes that it is creating density in its trade lanes, which creates opportunities for the Company to more efficiently source and manage its transportation capacity. 
 In addition to its focus on organic growth, the Company will continue to search for acquisition candidates that bring critical mass from a geographic and purchasing power standpoint, along with providing complementary service offerings to the current platform. As the Company continues to grow and scale its business, it also remains focused on leveraging its back-office infrastructure and technology systems to drive productivity improvement across the organization. 
 Impact of Notable External Conditions 
 The global economic and trade environments remain uncertain, including inflation, geopolitical tensions and changes in consumer behavior could have a negative impact on our business and financial results. 
 Performance Metrics 
 Our principal source of income is derived from freight forwarding and freight brokerage services we provide to our customers. As a third-party logistics provider, we arrange for the shipment of our customers freight from point of origin to point of destination. Generally, we quote our customers a turnkey cost for the movement of their freight. Our price quote will often depend upon the customer s time-definite needs (first day through fifth day delivery), special handling needs (heavy equipment, delicate items, environmentally sensitive goods, electronic components, etc.), and the means of transport (motor carrier, air, ocean or rail). In turn, we assume the responsibility for arranging and paying for the underlying means of transportation. 
 Our transportation revenue represents the total dollar value of services we sell to our customers. Our cost of transportation includes direct costs of transportation, including motor carrier, air, ocean, and rail services. Our adjusted gross profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, is gross revenue less the direct cost of transportation and other services (excluding depreciation and amortization, which are reported separately), and is the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, and resell services provided by third-parties, and is considered by management to be a key performance measure. Adjusted gross profit percentage is adjusted gross profit as a percent of our total revenue. In addition, management believes measuring its operating costs as a function of adjusted gross profit provides a useful metric, as our ability to control costs as a function of adjusted gross profit directly impacts operating results. We believe that these

provide investors with meaningful information to understand our results of operations and the ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. 
 Our operating results will be affected as acquisitions occur. Since acquisitions are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, our financial statements will only include the results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition. 
 Our GAAP-based net income will be affected by non-cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets attributable to completed acquisitions. Under applicable accounting standards, purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration in a business combination to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the time of acquisition. The excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is to be allocated to goodwill, which is tested at least annually for impairment. Applicable accounting standards require that we separately account for and value certain identifiable intangible assets based on the unique facts and circumstances of each acquisition. As a result of our acquisition strategy, our net income will include material non-cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions. Although these charges may increase as we complete more acquisitions, we believe we will be growing the value of our intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships). Thus, we believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is a useful financial measure for investors because it eliminates the effect of these non-cash costs and provides an important metric for our business. 
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of income and does not include the effects of interest, taxes, and the non-cash effects of depreciation and amortization on long-term assets. Companies have some discretion as to which elements of depreciation and amortization are excluded in the EBITDA calculation. We exclude all depreciation charges related to property, technology, and equipment and all amortization charges (including amortization of leasehold improvements). We then further adjust EBITDA to exclude share-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, expenses specifically attributable to acquisitions, cybersecurity incident related costs, changes in fair value of interest rate swap contracts, transition and lease termination costs, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, litigation expenses unrelated to our core operations, and other non-cash charges. While management considers EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA useful in analyzing our results, it is not intended to replace any presentation included in our condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company s financial covenants with its lenders define an adjusted EBITDA as a key component of its covenant calculations. The Company s ability to grow adjusted EBITDA is closely monitored by management as it s directly tied to financial borrowing capacity and also is a frequent point of discussion with its investors as well as the Company s earnings calls. 
 Our operating results are also subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The impact of seasonality on our business will depend on numerous factors, including the markets in which we operate, holiday seasons, consumer demand, and economic conditions. Since our revenue is largely derived from customers whose shipments are dependent upon consumer demand and just-in-time production schedules, the timing of our revenue is often beyond our control. Factors such as shifting demand for retail goods and/or manufacturing production delays could unexpectedly affect the timing of our revenue. As we increase the scale of our operations, seasonal trends in one area of our business may be offset to an extent by opposite trends in another area. We cannot accurately predict the timing of these factors, nor can we accurately estimate the impact of any particular factor, and thus we can give no assurance any historical seasonal patterns will continue in future periods.

(1) Adjusted gross profit is revenues less the cost of transportation and other services. 

Transportation revenue was 191.8 million and 198.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 6.2 million, or 3.1 is due to the loss of a strategic operating partner offset by increases from several new acquisitions. Adjusted transportation gross profit was 50.8 million and 53.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net transportation margins decreased from 27.2 to 26.5 , primarily due to a higher mix of ocean shipments, which have lower gross profit margin characteristics than other modes of transportation. 
 Value-added services revenue was 11.7 million and 12.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease is driven by lower volumes from certain customers compared to the prior year period. Adjusted value-added services gross profit was 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.0 million for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted value-added services gross profit percentage increased from 54.7 to 57.6 .

(1) Adjusted gross profit is revenues less the cost of transportation and other services. 

Operating partner commissions decreased 5.0 million, or 20.9 , to 18.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction of adjusted gross profit generated from our strategic operating partners, lower freight volumes, and the conversions of strategic operating partners to Company-owned locations who earned commissions in the comparable prior year period. As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, operating partner commissions decreased 643 basis points to 32.7 from 39.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Personnel costs were flat at 19.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, personnel costs increased 183 basis points to 34.1 from 32.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased 0.8 million, or 8.9 , to 10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to increased technology spending, higher travel costs, increased credit losses, and additional facility costs due to recent acquisitions, partially offset by lower professional services fees and bank fees. As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, SG A increased 235 basis points to 17.9 from 15.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Depreciation and amortization costs increased 0.3 million, or 6.2 , to 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is attributable to amortization of intangible assets from prior year acquisitions. As a percentage of adjusted gross profit, depreciation and amortization costs increased 91 basis points to 8.3 from 7.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Our increase in net income is driven principally by decreased operating partner commissions, partially offset by decreased adjusted gross profit compared to the comparable prior year period. 
 Our future financial results may be impacted by amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, gains or losses from changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and changes in fair value of interest rate swap contracts, which are difficult to predict. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Generally, our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, as described below. These sources also fund a portion of our capital expenditures and contractual contingent consideration obligations. Our level of cash and financing capabilities along with cash flows from operations have historically been sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs. As of September 30, 2024, we have 10.4 million in unrestricted cash on hand and access to a revolving credit facility to serve as adequate working capital. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 0.2 million and 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities primarily consisted of net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 7.7 million, compared with the same period in fiscal year 2024, primarily due to net changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and payments of contingent consideration. 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 13.5 million and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash paid for acquisition was 11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cash paid for purchases of property, technology, and equipment were 2.1 million and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 1.2 million and 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were 0.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to no net borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Payments of debt issuance costs were 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Repayments of notes payable and finance lease liabilities were 0.2 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Payments for repurchases of common stock were 0.7 million and 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Distribution to non-controlling interest was 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Payments of employee tax withholdings related to restricted stock units and stock options were 0.5 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Company entered into a 200 million syndicated, revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement dated as of August 5, 2022, and amended as of September 27, 2023. The Revolving Credit Facility is segregated into two tranches, a 150 million tranche that may be loaned in U.S. Dollars and a 50 million tranche that may be loaned in either U.S. Dollars or Canadian Dollars. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a 75 million accordion feature to support future acquisition opportunities. The Revolving Credit Facility was entered into with Bank of America, N.A. and BMO Capital Markets Corp. as joint book runners and joint lead arrangers, Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of Montreal as syndication agent, KeyBank National Association and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. as co-documentation agents and Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, KeyBank National Association, MUFG Union Bank, N.A. and Washington Federal Bank, National Association as lenders (such named lenders are collectively referred to herein as Lenders ). 
 The Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 5, 2027 and is collateralized by a first-priority security interest in the accounts receivable and other assets of the Company and the guarantors. Borrowings in U.S. Dollars accrue interest (at the Company s option) at a) the Lenders base rate plus 0.50 to 1.50 ; b) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus 1.40 to 2.40 ; or c) Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate plus 1.40 to 2.40 . Borrowings in Canadian Dollars accrue interest (at the Company s option) at a) Term Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA plus 0.29547 to 0.32138 depending on the term, plus 1.40 to 2.40 ; or b) Daily Simple CORRA plus 0.29547 plus 1.40 to 2.40 . Rates are adjusted based on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio. The Company s U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries are guarantors of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 For borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is subject to the maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.00 and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00. Additional minimum availability requirements and financial covenants apply in the event the Company seeks to use advances under the Revolving Credit Facility to pursue acquisitions or repurchase its common stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility were 0.2 million. The Company was in compliance with its covenants. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosure about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business. These risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk. We have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as well as intercompany transactions. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

Significant changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies in which we transact business and the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we have not entered into any hedging activities, and, to the extent that we continue not to do so in the future, we may be vulnerable to the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. A portion of our business is conducted in Canada. If foreign exchange rates were 1.0 higher or lower, our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 would have changed by approximately 0.01 million. 
 We are also subject to risks related to an increase in interest rates. For every 1.0 million outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility, we will incur approximately 0.05 million of interest expense. For every 1.0 increase in interest rates, our interest expense per 1.0 million in borrowings will increase by approximately 0.01 million. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 An evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024 was carried out by our management under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and CFO. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024 due to the existence of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 Management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). 
 Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures, which: 
 1. pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

2. provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and 

3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weakness discussed below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Material Weakness over the Recording and Processing of Revenue Transactions and Remediation Progress 
 As of June 30, 2023, we concluded that a material weakness existed in our internal controls over financial reporting related to the recording and processing of revenues. As of September 30, 2024, remediation was ongoing. As such, as of September 30, 2024, we concluded that a material weakness still existed in our internal controls over financial reporting related to the recording and processing 
 30

of revenues. Specifically, the controls as currently designed are not sufficient to prevent or detect a material misstatement in revenues as the design of the controls lack the level of precision necessary to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenues. 
 During fiscal year 2024, management made significant progress designing and implementing a series of new, or enhanced existing controls aimed at mitigating risks associated with the accuracy, completeness, occurrence, and cut-off of reported revenue. This included a series of controls operating at various frequencies and levels of precision to detect material misstatements, including, among others: 
 Individual transactions meeting certain risk criteria are tested and analyzed for accuracy by comparing historical revenue and margin data, invoices, outstanding receivables, and payments. In some cases, inquiries and confirmation may be obtained from operators at individual locations; 

Individual transactions are tested, on a sample basis, to ensure they are supported by carrier invoices, indicating legitimate shipments, and to the corresponding cash receipts; 

Regional Vice Presidents review weekly and monthly revenue variances exceeding a set threshold, using historical data and inquiring or confirming with operators at individual locations when necessary; 

Implementation of controls that verify, on a sample basis, actual departure and proof of delivery dates for selected transactions, ensuring the inputs to the revenue accrual are accurate; 

Improved procedures and controls to enhance the granularity and precision over the month-end revenue accrual process; 

Enhanced lookback procedures to test the accuracy of prior month-end revenue accruals; and 

Performed additional review and analysis of unposted shipments to improve the accuracy of the revenue accrual. 

As management has evaluated, designed and implemented the processes needed to remediate its internal controls weakness, it has done so in light of, among others: (a) the need to design and implement such processes in a manner that will not disrupt, to the best extent possible, the historic commercial processes that the Company has deployed across its network of Company-owned and strategic operating partner locations since its inception, and (b) management s firm belief that, despite the material weakness in process and controls, the Company s ultimate billing and collection processes continue to work on a commercially sound basis and the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q continue to fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. No further errors requiring restatement have been identified. 
 Management believes that the suite of controls it has implemented or enhanced during fiscal year 2024 and 2025, which operate at various frequencies and levels of precision, will provide reasonable assurance that a potential material misstatement in revenue would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. That being said, while many of these new and enhanced controls had been in operation for much of fiscal year 2024; certain controls were implemented closer to year end, and the documentation supporting the performance of these controls can still be improved to demonstrate that the controls operate as they were designed for a sufficient period to conclude the controls are effective. We may also need to refine the underlying design and implementation as we continue to evaluate the manner in which they operate over a longer period before concluding that the material weakness has been resolved. Nevertheless, in recognition of the progress made during fiscal year 2024, and management s resolve to address the remaining weakness, it is our goal to resolve the material weakness in fiscal year 2025. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the remediation activities of the material weakness over the recording and processing of revenue transactions described above, there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 P ART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 I tem 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company and its subsidiaries may be subject to legal actions and claims arising from contracts or other matters from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Management is not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceedings that are considered other than routine legal proceedings. The Company believes that the ultimate disposition or resolution of its routine legal proceedings, in the aggregate, are not material to its financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
 It em 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed by us under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
