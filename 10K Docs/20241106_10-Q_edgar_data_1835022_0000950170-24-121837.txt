 NOTES TO CONDENSED UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant sales of its product candidates currently in development. Substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to commercially develop its product candidates. No assurance can be given that any such financing will be available when needed or that the Company s research and development efforts will be successful. The Company follows the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or when applicable, one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued). The Company's cash and cash equivalents of million as of September 30, 2024 , together with the million of gross proceeds received from the closing of its private placement in October 2024, are expected to enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2026, at which time the Company will need to secure additional funding. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, the lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company s future prospects. The accompanying condensed unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management is currently evaluating different strategies to obtain the required funding of future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, additional funding from current investors, funding from new investors including strategic corporate investors, and additional registrations of the Company s common stock. There can be no assurance these future funding efforts will be successful. Risks and uncertainties The Company is subject to a number of risks associated with companies at a similar stage, including dependence on key individuals, competition from similar products and larger companies, volatility of the industry, ability to obtain adequate financing to support growth, the ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel to manage the anticipated growth of the Company, and general economic conditions.

million. The Company will pay to DRL up to an aggregate of approximately million of pre-approval regulatory milestone payments for the first indication in the Field (as defined in the DRL Agreement), of which the Company has paid an aggregate of million to date, and an additional approximately million if all other development, regulatory approval and sales milestones are incurred under the DRL Agreement. The Company will also pay to DRL a low-six figure milestone payment per additional indication. Further, pursuant to the DRL Agreement, the Company will pay to DRL single-digit royalties on Net Sales (as defined in the DRL Agreement). In December 2023, the Company granted DRL an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize COYA 302 (Note 9). ARS License Agreement In August 2022, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the ARS License Agreement with ARScience Biotherapeutics, Inc. ARS pursuant to which ARS granted the Company an option, which was exercised in December 2022, to acquire an exclusive, royalty-bearing license for two patents, with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers under these patents (the ARS Option ). The Company may owe tiered payments to ARS based on its achievement of certain developmental milestones. Under the ARS License Agreement, the Company will pay an aggregate of million in developmental milestone payments for the first Combination Product (as defined in the ARS License Agreement) in a new indication. The Company will then pay an aggregate of million in developmental milestone payments for each Combination Product in each subsequent new indication. Further, for the first Mono Product (as defined In the ARS License Agreement) the Company will pay an aggregate of million in developmental milestone payments. The Company will then pay an aggregate of million in developmental milestone payments for each Mono Product in each subsequent new indication, and an aggregate of million if all developmental milestones are achieved for each new indication. The Company will also owe royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to mid-single digit percentages. In the event the Company sublicenses its rights under the ARS License Agreement, the Company will owe royalties on sublicense income within the range of to . Houston Methodist Agreements In September 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Patent Know How and License Agreement, effective as of October 2020 (the Methodist License Agreement ), with The Methodist Hospital Methodist to make, sell and sublicense products and services using the intellectual property and know-how of Methodist. As part of the Methodist License Agreement, the Company will pay Methodist a four-figure license maintenance fee annually until the first sale of licensed product occurs. The term of the Methodist License Agreement is effective until no intellectual property patent rights remain, unless terminated sooner by (1) bankruptcy or insolvency, (2) the failure by the Company to monetize the intellectual property within five years of the date of the agreement (further discussed below), (3) due to breach of contract, or (4) at our election for any or no reason. Patent reimbursements paid by the Company to Methodist and its attorneys are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. Such costs were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition to the equity issued to Methodist in 2020 and reimbursement of patent related expenses, the Methodist License requires the Company to make payments of up to million per product candidate in aggregate upon the achievement of specific development and regulatory milestone events by such licensed product. The Company is also required to pay Methodist, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties (subject to customary reductions) equal to high-single digit to low-double digit percentages of annual worldwide net sales of such licensed product during a defined royalty term. The Company is also required to pay a low single digit percentage for certain licensed services. Commencing on January 1, 2025, the minimum amount which will be owed by the Company once commercialization occurs is million annually. Sponsored Research Agreement In May 2023, the Company entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement SRA with Houston Methodist Research Institute HMRI ), a Texas nonprofit corporation and an affiliate of Methodist, in which the Company agreed to fund approximately million

million to million in total funding. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company funded million of the total commitment. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred million and million , respectively, in research and development expenses related to the SRA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred million and million , respectively, in research and development expenses related to the SRA. Employment contracts The Company has entered into employment contracts with its officers and certain employees that provide for severance and continuation of benefits in the event of termination of employment either by the Company without cause or by the employee for good reason, both as defined in the agreements. In addition, in the event of termination of employment following a change in control, as defined in each agreement, either by the Company without cause or by the employee for good reason, any unvested portion of the employee s initial stock option grant becomes immediately vested. Litigation Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. There are no material matters currently outstanding. 

shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of per share for net proceeds of million. In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into an Agreement to Accept Conditions for Biotechnology Funding agreement (the "Funding Agreement") with ADDF, pursuant to which the proceeds received in connection with the Securities Purchase agreement shall be used for a Phase 2 study of COYA 302 in FTD. Common stock warrants During its evaluation of equity classification for the Company's common stock warrants, the Company considered the conditions as prescribed within ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging, Contracts in an Entity s own Equity. The conditions within ASC 815-40 are not subject to a probability assessment. The warrants do not fall under the liability criteria within ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity as they are not puttable and do not represent an instrument that has a redeemable underlying security. The warrants do meet the definition of a derivative instrument under ASC 815, but are eligible for the scope exception as they are indexed to the Company s own stock and would be classified in permanent equity if freestanding.

of the total shares of the Company's common stock outstanding as of immediately preceding December 31, unless a lesser amount is stipulated by the Company's Board of Directors. Accordingly, shares were added to the reserve as of January 1, 2024. On May 8, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors and stockholders approved an increase of shares to be authorized for future issuance. As of September 30, 2024, shares of the Company s common stock were authorized to be issued under the 2021 Plan, of which shares were available for future issuance. The amount, terms of grants, and exercisability provisions are determined and set by the Company's Board of Directors or compensation committee. The Company measures employee stock-based awards at grant-date fair value and records compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. 

Research and development 

Stock options The Company has issued service-based stock options that generally have a contractual life of up to years and may be exercisable in cash or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors. Vesting generally occurs over a period of not greater than .

Vested and expected to vest at September 30, 2024 

As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized compensation cost was million , and will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of years. The fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which takes into account inputs such as the exercise price, the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock at the grant date, expected term, estimated stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. The fair value of stock options granted during the period ended September 30, 2024 was determined using the methods and assumptions discussed below. The expected term of employee stock options with service-based vesting is determined using the simplified method, as prescribed in SEC s Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 107, whereby the expected life equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option due to the Company s lack of sufficient historical data. 

 The expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of comparable public entities within the Company s industry, which were commensurate with the expected term assumption as described in SAB No. 107. 

 The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate payable on U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the time of grant for a period that is commensurate with the expected term. 

 The expected dividend yield is because the Company has not historically paid, and does not expect, for the foreseeable future, to pay a dividend on its common stock.

Restricted stock unit awards During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company issued restricted stock units ("RSU") to an external consultant which immediately vested upon grant. The fair value of an RSU is equal to the fair market value price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The stock-based compensation expense was immaterial for nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to these RSUs.

million and, in return, Dr. Reddy's will have no obligation to pay the first million in royalty payments that would have otherwise been payable to the Company under the DRL Development Agreement. The collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee JSC which is comprised of representatives from both parties. Decisions of the JSC are made by consensus. If the JSC is unable to reach a consensus, and the parties executives are not able to resolve the dispute, then Dr. Reddy s has final decision-making authority, subject to specified limitations (as set forth in the DRL Development Agreement).

million in January 2024. Additionally, the Company is entitled to receive (i) an additional million upon acceptance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the " FDA") of an Investigational New Drug ("IND"), application for COYA 302 for the treatment of ALS and (ii) an additional million payment upon the dosing of the first patient in the first phase 2 clinical trial for COYA 302 for the treatment of ALS in the United States. The DRL Development Agreement also calls for up to an aggregate of approximately million in development milestones and up to an aggregate of approximately million in sales milestones, related to the New Territories, should all such development and sales milestones be achieved. The Company will also be owed royalties by Dr. Reddy's on Net Sales (as defined in the DRL Development Agreement) of the Product in the low to mid-teens. Pursuant to the First Amendment, as discussed above, the first million of royalty payments will not be owed to the Company. Both parties shall discuss in good faith and agree in writing on the terms of a commercial supply agreement for the purpose of supply of COYA 302 to Dr. Reddy s. No such agreement has been entered into at the time of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The DRL Development Agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon expiration of Dr. Reddy's obligation to make royalty payments for Product in each territory. Dr. Reddy's has the right to terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to the Company. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the agreement by, or insolvency of, the other party. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event that the other party commences a legal action challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent rights. In accordance with the guidance, the Company identified the following commitments under the arrangement: 1) the License and 2) the R D Services. The Company determined that these two commitments represent distinct performance obligations for purposes of recognizing revenue as the Company fulfills these performance obligations. The Company included the million upfront payment in the transaction price as of the outset of the arrangement and allocated that transaction price to the two performance obligations based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices at contract inception. The stand-alone selling price of the License was based on a discounted cash flow approach and considered several factors including, but not limited to, discount rate, development timeline, regulatory risks, estimated market demand and future revenue potential using an adjusted market approach. The stand-alone selling price of the R D Services was estimated using the expected cost-plus margin approach. The Company has recognized the License portion of the transaction price of million in prior periods upon delivery of the License . The Company will recognize the remaining transaction price of million allocated to the R D Services over the period of performance, using an inputs approach. In June 2024, the transaction price was increased by the million payment received in connection with the First Amendment, which did not add any additional performance obligations. As such, the Company allocated the increase in transaction price to the License and R D Services performance obligation in the same manner as was performed at contract inception using the estimated standalone selling price. The million increase in transaction price resulted in an increase of License revenue of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a cumulative catch-up of for the License transfer in 2023. The cumulative catch-up for R D Services was immaterial. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized million of collaboration revenue which was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023, associated with the performance of R D Services. Any portion of a change in transaction price that is allocated to a satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligation will be recognized as revenue (or as a reduction in revenue) in the period of the transaction price change on a cumulative catch-up basis. The commercial milestones and sales-based royalties will be recognized when earned (i.e., the later of when the subsequent sales occur or the performance obligation has been satisfied). As of September 30, 2024, million of the payments received from Dr. Reddy's was recorded in deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets, of which million is estimated to be recognized within . In the third quarter of 2024, the FDA contacted the Company stating that additional non-clinical data must be submitted prior to initiating the Company's planned randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of COYA 302 in patients with ALS. As a result, the Company's estimated cost to fulfill the R D Services performance obligation increased and the time period to satisfy the performance obligation was extended. R D Services revenue is calculated quarterly using the inputs approach, by applying actual COYA 302 expenses against budgeted COYA 302 expenses as the inputs. Budgeted spending for COYA 302 includes total forecasted pre-clinical and clinical costs, associated with the advancement of COYA 302 for the treatment of patients with ALS, necessary to satisfy the R D Services performance obligation. The increase in budgeted COYA 302 expenses offset the actual COYA 302 expenses incurred during the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in immaterial movements of R D Services revenue. As such, R D Services revenue was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Overview 
 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing proprietary new therapies to enhance the function of regulatory T cells, or Tregs. Tregs are a subpopulation of T-lymphocytes consisting of CD4+CD25high hFOXP3+ cells that suppress inflammatory responses. Tregs were first discovered in 1995 by Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi and since their discovery, multiple lines of research have contributed to elucidate Treg biology and its role in health and disease. Tregs and their transcription factors have been shown to be essential to maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating autoimmune and inflammatory responses and maintaining self-tolerance in mammals. Dysfunctional Tregs underlie numerous disease states, and this cellular dysfunction is driven by the chronic inflammatory environment and high levels of oxidative stress commonly observed in certain diseases. Further, the degree of Treg dysfunction is correlated with the severity and progression of serious and life-threatening conditions. These and other recent advances in the understanding of Treg biology, have made this subset of T-lymphocytes an important potential therapeutic target, which we believe may provide new treatments for serious diseases. 
 
 We have built a diversified product candidate pipeline that includes both ex vivo and in vivo approaches intended to restore the suppressive and immunomodulatory functions of Tregs. Our product candidate pipeline is based on our three distinct potential therapeutic modalities: Treg-enhancing biologics, Treg-derived exosomes, and autologous Treg cell therapy. Autologous means the treatment of a patient with human cells derived from the patient itself, whereas Allogeneic means the treatment of a patient with human cells derived from a donor other than the patient, where such donor is genetically non-identical. Our core focus is to develop these therapies to target Treg dysfunction, which has been identified to be an important pathophysiological component of neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases, where new and effective therapies are urgently needed. 
 
 Our lead asset, COYA 302, is a Treg-enhancing biologic, which has been developed from key learnings established in our early work and discoveries of our autologous Treg cell therapy asset. Our autologous Treg cell therapy program has completed Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. We believe the clinical data from these initial studies serves as an important confirmation of the underlying immunomodulatory properties of Tregs and their potential therapeutic benefits. These studies have also significantly expanded our own foundational knowledge of the biological activity of Tregs and key biomarkers of disease progression and drug effect, which we believe will be critical for the design of our future clinical and preclinical studies, the selection of future targeted diseases and the overall advancement of our development pipeline. We believe our findings have also established mechanistic benefits of combination biologics to address Treg dysfunction as well as highlighted important advantages of scalability and cost. 
 
 COYA 302 is the combination of our proprietary low dose interleukin-2 (COYA 301, or LD IL-2) and the immunomodulatory drug CTLA4-Ig, and we believe this combination has the potential to provide a sustained and durable effect on our first series of indications (neurodegenerative disorders) through targeting of multiple pathways. Our research and clinical efforts have led us to believe that combination biologics using our LD IL-2 as a backbone modality could be the best way to treat neurodegenerative conditions that are inherently driven by a complexity of pathways. We believe COYA 302 represents the most clinically advanced of what we hope will be a family of combination therapies that all feature our LD IL-2. Moreover, given its growing list of indications, we can now refer to COYA 302 as a Pipeline in a Product. 
 
 Our operations have consisted of developing our clinical and preclinical product candidates and we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and staffing our company, business planning and raising capital. We have funded our operations primarily through private convertible preferred stock offerings, a convertible debt financing, public and private offerings of our securities, and payments from certain of our license and collaboration agreements. Our net losses were 4.0 million and 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net losses were 12.0 million and 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 37.8 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates. 
 
 20 

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through all stages of development and clinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities as we: 
 continue our ongoing and planned research and development of our product candidates; 

initiate nonclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates that we may pursue; 

continue to scale up external manufacturing capacity with the aim of securing sufficient quantities to meet our capacity requirements for clinical trials and potential commercialization; 

establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates and related additional commercial manufacturing costs; 

develop, maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; 

acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; 

add clinical, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and 

incur additional legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses associated with operating as a public company. 

Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenditures on other research and development activities. 
 
 We will need to raise substantial additional capital to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we plan to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. The financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Product Developments 
 
 During the first half of 2023, two proof of concept, or POC studies conducted with commercially available products, as investigator-initiated trials, or IITs, reported results. First, the combination of LD IL-2 and abatacept showed positive results in a POC open label study in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. In the second POC study, LD IL-2 showed positive results in Alzheimer s Disease, or AD patients. 
 
 The POC study of LD IL-2 in support of COYA 301, an open label study conducted in 8 patients with AD, evaluated the safety and tolerability, biological activity, blood biomarkers, and preliminary efficacy of commercially available IL-2. Study data found that (i) cognitive function, as measured by 3 validated tools, either improved or did not decline, (ii) Treg function was significantly enhanced, (iii) pro-inflammatory blood cytokines and chemokines were significantly reduced with evidence of reduced neuroinflammation in the brain and (iv) the study treatment appeared to be well tolerated as no serious adverse events were reported. 
 
 The POC study of LD IL-2 and abatacept in support of COYA 302, an open label study conducted in 4 ALS patients, evaluated the safety and tolerability, function of regulatory T-cells, biomarkers, and preliminary efficacy (as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale) utilizing commercially available IL-2 and abatacept. Study data showed no decline or minimal decline at 24 and 48 weeks respectively after initiation of treatment and appeared to be well tolerated in all study patients as no serious adverse events were reported. Twenty-four weeks is an important timepoint as this is the period that ALS studies are usually benchmarked to measure differences in the ALSFRS-R scale for a treatment versus placebo. Based on this POC data, we decided to design and conduct a well-powered and well-controlled Phase 2 study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of COYA 302 (COYA 301 or LD IL-2, plus an abatacept proposed biosimilar, or DRL_AB, licensed from DRL) in patients with ALS. 
 
 We submitted an IND with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in the second quarter of 2024 for a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of our first-in-class biologic combination COYA 302 in ALS patients. On July 12, 2024, 
 21 

we received an email notification from the FDA stating that additional nonclinical data was required prior to the initiation of this study and that further guidance would be provided. On August 9, 2024, the FDA provided feedback that additional nonclinical toxicology/pharmacology data were required prior to initiating our proposed study. On November 1, 2024, we had productive communication with the FDA and believe we now have alignment on their expectations for the required additional nonclinical data. We are endeavoring to complete the required nonclinical studies and submit the required data necessary to support our IND in the second quarter of 2025. We intend to initiate the proposed Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ALS upon approval of the IND by the FDA. However, there can be no certainty that the FDA will find that additional information sufficient or that it will permit us to start clinical trials with COYA 302 within our proposed timing or at all. 
 
 On October 29, 2024, we announced that results from the investigator-initiated placebo-controlled Phase 2 POC clinical trial of LD IL-2 in patients with mild to moderate AD were announced on that same day at the 17th Clinical Trials on Alzheimer s Disease Conference, or CTAD24, in Madrid, Spain. The study was led by Dr. Alireza Faridar and Dr. Stanley Appel from the Houston Methodist Research Institute. Dr. Appel is a member of our Scientific Advisory Board. The study received funding from the Alzheimer's Association, the Gates Foundation, and the National Institute on Aging, with additional support from us. 
 
 Study Design 
 
 The investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial evaluated two dosing regimens of subcutaneous LD IL-2 in 38 participants with AD that were between the ages of 50 to 86 and had Mini-Mental State Examination, or MMSE, scores ranging from 12 to 26. 
 
 Of the 38 total participants, 22 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 5 days of LD IL-2 (106 IU/day), or LD IL-2 q4wks, or placebo every 4 weeks for 21 weeks. An additional 16 participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 5-day cycles of LD IL-2 every 2 weeks, or LD IL-2 q2wks, or placebo for the same 21-week duration. All participants were monitored for 9 weeks post-treatment, resulting in a total study period of 30 weeks. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were comparable among the treatment groups. 
 
 The primary endpoint was the incidence and severity of adverse events, or AEs, with the secondary endpoint evaluating changes in Tregs. Exploratory endpoints assessed changes in cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, AD-related biomarkers, and cognitive status. 
 
 Study Results 
 
 The study successfully met its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating that treatment with LD IL-2 is safe and well-tolerated in patients with Alzheimer s disease. Notably, LD IL-2 showed targeted biological activity, evidenced by a significant expansion of regulatory T cell populations in the LD IL-2 q4wks group without any off-target effects on other peripheral lymphocytes. Additionally, the q4wks regimen led to significant improvements (defined by increased levels) in cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF-soluble A 42 levels, an indicator of amyloid pathology, and showed a promising trend in stabilizing cognitive function, with a clinically meaningful 4.93-point improvement 1 in the ADAS-Cog14 score compared to placebo. 
 
 In contrast, the q2wks group, representing the higher total dose cohort, did not exhibit benefits in exploratory endpoints, underscoring the importance of appropriate IL-2 dosing for maintaining Treg functionality and its associated effects on CSF biomarkers and cognitive outcomes. LD IL-2 q2wks dosing also resulted in a reduction of Foxp3 expression, a critical marker of Treg functionality (a lower level or loss of Foxp3 expression is associated with unstable/dysfunctional Tregs). While these unstable Tregs continue to show suppressive immune response in vitro, they may lose their immunomodulatory functions in vivo, potentially explaining the dose impact on Treg populations and associated exploratory endpoints. As a result of these data, we will likely advance LD IL-2 q4wks. 
 
 Primary Endpoint (Safety and Tolerability): All patients completed the 21-week treatment phase. The proportion of patients experiencing adverse events, or AEs, was similar between the LD IL-2 treatment groups and the placebo group, with no serious AEs or deaths reported. The most common AEs in the LD IL-2 groups included mild erythema at the injection site and a slight increase in eosinophil counts. 
 
 Secondary Endpoint (Treg Cell Populations): There was a significant increase (p 
 
 Exploratory Endpoint (Cognitive Function Cerebrospinal Fluid, or CSF, Biomarkers) 
 22 

Although not powered for significance, the analyses of exploratory endpoints also showed encouraging results. 
 
 Cognitive Function: The Alzheimer s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14) scores on day 148 showed a slight improvement following LD IL-2 q4wks administration (change from baseline: -0.450), vs. placebo, which worsened 4.480 from baseline, demonstrating a clinically meaningful difference of 4.93 points (P=0.061). This cognitive effect was not observed in the LD IL-2 q2wks administration, which demonstrated a similar decline as placebo. 
 
 Stabilization of ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale) scores was observed in both the IL-2 q4wks and IL-2 q2wks groups on day 148 compared to the placebo arm, which declined from baseline. 
 
 The change from baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes, or CDR-SOB, on Day 148 was 1.401 in the LD IL-2 q4wks group, 1.976 in the LD IL-2 q2wks group, and 1.893 in the placebo group, suggesting a 27 slower decline in CDR-SOB scores following LD IL-2 q4wks treatment compared to the placebo group. These findings suggest that LD IL-2 q4wks may be an optimal dose for cognitive effects in mild to moderate AD, which was the dose associated with a robust and sustained increase in Treg populations along with enhanced expression of the IL-2 receptor, CD25, and the Treg transcription factor, FoxP3. Furthermore, the cognitive effect of this dose was associated with significant improvements in AD pathology in the CSF and stabilization of CSF inflammatory markers. 
 
 CSF A 42: Low CSF A 42 is universally associated with AD, and higher CSF A 42 levels are independently associated with slowing cognitive impairment and clinical decline. Increases in A 42 may represent a mechanism of potential benefit of intervention. LD IL-2 q4wks treatment significantly improved CSF A 42 levels after the 21-week treatment, compared to the placebo group (p = 0.045). LD IL-2 q2wks treatment did not significantly modify CSF A 42 levels. These data further suggest the dose-dependent effect of LD IL-2 on Treg cell populations (i.e. FOXP3) is associated with effects on CSF A 42. 
 
 CSF Neurofilament Light Chain, or NfL: NfL is increasingly recognized as a promising biomarker for neurodegeneration (neuronal/axonal degeneration) in AD. Residing predominantly within myelinated axons, NfL is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a role in maintaining neuronal structural integrity and axonal caliber. Neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases releases NfL into the extracellular space and eventually into the CSF, resulting in higher CSF NfL levels in AD. 
 
 CSF NfL levels remained stable following LD IL-2 q4wks administration and almost reached statistical significance vs. placebo (which increased by 217.3pg/mL) (p=0.060). CSF NfL increased by 148.0 pg/mL in the LD IL-2 q2wks arm. These data suggest the dose-dependent effect of LD IL-2 on Treg cell populations (i.e. FOXP3) is associated with effects on CSF NfL. 
 
 CSF Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein, or GFAP: GFAP is an astrocytic cytoskeleton intermediate filament protein. GFAP is a marker of astrogliosis, which is the abnormal activation and proliferation of astrocytes. Astrogliosis is associated with A plaques in the prodromal stages of AD. 
 
 CSF GFAP levels showed a slight improvement following LD IL-2 q4wks administration (change from baseline: -214.1 pg/mL) and remained almost stable in the LD IL-2 q2wks group (change from baseline: 17.4 pg/mL), but increased by 1548.99 pg/mL in the placebo group. 
 
 Pipeline Expansion 
 
 In January of 2024, we announced that we are expanding our pipeline in neurodegenerative conditions for COYA 302 beyond ALS to include FTD and PD. More recently, in February of 2024, we announced our expansion of COYA 302 to AD. This expansion advances our approach of combination biologics with LD IL-2 as a backbone which we believe may represent a new strategy to target complex immune pathways in neurodegenerative diseases. 
 
 FTD, AD and PD share a similar disease pathogenesis to ALS that is associated with a heightened proinflammatory cascade involving dysfunctional Tregs and proinflammatory microglia and macrophages. We believe the biological redundancies in molecular immune pathways in these complex diseases limit the efficacy of many single drug therapies, requiring the development of novel therapeutics that can address this pathophysiologic complexity. 
 
 We intend to file an IND for COYA 302 for the treatment of FTD after the IND for the Phase 2 trial of COYA 302 in patients with ALS is approved by the FDA. 
 
 In addition, studies in animal models of PD are ongoing, and based on those studies, a subsequent IND may be filed for the treatment of PD. We are evaluating the recently announced results of the double-blind placebo-controlled trial in AD being conducted 
 23 

by Dr. Alireza Faridar and Dr. Stanley Appel of LD IL-2 (described above), one of the key components of COYA 302, prior to determining our development plan for COYA 302 in AD patients. 
 
 In the second half of 2025, we anticipate that clinical data in FTD patients will be reported for a proof-of-concept, investigator-initiated, open-label study conducted at Houston Methodist Hospital to assess safety and tolerability of LD IL-2, plus CTLA-4 Ig Fusion Protein (Abatacept) immunotherapy. Up to 10 FTD patients will be administered subcutaneous abatacept (125 mg) followed by five-day-courses of IL-2 (1MUI/day) every two or four weeks for a total of 21 weeks. Outcomes will include safety and tolerability, impact of treatment on Treg cell populations, effects on peripheral and central inflammation, as well as the rate of FTD progression using clinical rating scales. 
 
 Financings 
 
 On October 21, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors, majority of which were existing institutional stockholders of ours, for the issuance and sale in a private placement of 1,379,314 shares of our common stock, or the October 2024 Private Placement. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of 10.0 million, at a price of 7.25 per share of common stock, before deducting placement agent commissions and other offering expenses. 
 
 On May 17, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, or the ADDF, for the issuance and sale in a private placement of 603,136 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 8.29 per share for net proceeds of 4.9 million, or the May 2024 Private Placement. In connection with this financing, we entered into an Agreement to Accept Conditions for Biotechnology Funding agreement, with ADDF pursuant to which the proceeds received in connection with the financing shall be used for a Phase 2 study of COYA 302 in FTD. 
 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Collaboration Revenue 
 
 To date, we have not recognized any revenue from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all. Collaboration revenue represents revenue from the DRL Development Agreement, as amended in June 2024, pursuant to which we granted Dr. Reddy's an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize COYA 302, solely for use in patients with ALS in the United States, Canada, the European Union and the United Kingdom, or collectively, the New Territories. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our potential therapeutic candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, including: 
 
 Expenses incurred to conduct discovery-stage laboratory work and preclinical studies including supplies, reagents, chemicals as well as external costs of funding research performed by third parties including consultants, academic and other institutions and clinical research organizations, or CROs that conduct our preclinical and nonclinical studies; 

activities being performed under our sponsored research arrangement with Houston Methodist; 

personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in research and development functions; 

clinical trial expenses and related clinical expenses to obtain regulatory approval of our therapeutic candidates including costs of research performed by third parties, costs associated with CRO s that conduct our clinical trials, costs to operate, manage, and monitor investigative sites and clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other professional services; 

clinical expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, or incurred directly by us for manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 

fees paid to consultants who assist with research and development activities; 

expenses related to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and 

allocated expenses for facility costs, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance. 

We classify and evaluate our research and development expenses in two dimensions: clinical and preclinical, and external and internal. We do not further classify or evaluate our internal research and development expenses by product candidate or by Series as 
 24 

these expenses primarily relate to compensation, materials and supplies, and other costs which are deployed across multiple potential therapeutic modalities, multiple product candidates, and multiple potential therapeutic areas under development. 
 
 Once a product candidate has received approval from the FDA of its IND application, we consider it a clinical product candidate. For each of our clinical product candidates, we report or will report external development costs and other external research and development costs attributable to such clinical product candidates. These external development costs include: fees paid to CROs, CMOs and research laboratories, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Any internal research and development expenses associated with clinical product candidates are captioned as internal research and development costs as described in the paragraph above. 
 
 Until such time as a product candidate has received approval of its IND application, we consider it a preclinical product candidate. Each of our preclinical product candidates is being developed on one of our three potential therapeutic modalities: (1) Treg-enhancing biologics; (2) Treg-derived exosomes; and (3) autologous Treg cell therapy. The product candidates utilizing our Treg-enhancing biologics are collectively referred to as the 300 Series. The product candidates utilizing our Treg-derived exosomes are collectively referred to as the 200 Series. The product candidates utilizing our autologous Treg cell therapy are collectively referred to as the 100 Series. Currently, our 300 Series product candidates include COYA 301 and COYA 302, our 200 Series product candidates include COYA 201 and COYA 206, and our 100 Series product candidate is COYA 101. For our preclinical candidates we report external development costs and other external research and development costs collectively by Series. These external development costs include: fees paid to CROs, CMOs and research laboratories, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Preclinical research and development activities often benefit more than one preclinical product candidate within a given Series and so disaggregating the data would neither be practicable or meaningful. 
 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, conduct our clinical trials, including later-stage clinical trials, for current and future product candidates and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. In addition, we expect spending in 2024 to increase over 2023 spending levels and will be focused primarily on advancing COYA 301 and COYA 302. As described in the notes to financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, under the terms of our license we may be required to make payments to Methodist if certain milestones are achieved. This could result in significant charges to research and development in the period such milestones become probable of being achieved. 
 
 In-Process Research and Development 
 
 Research and development costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged to research and development expense if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility which includes manufacturing, clinical, intellectual property and/or regulatory success which has no alternative future use. The licenses purchased by us require substantial completion of research and development and regulatory and marketing approval efforts in order to reach technological feasibility. As such, and since our inception, the purchase price of licenses acquired is classified as acquired in-process research and development expenses in the statements of operations. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for employees and consultants in executive, finance and accounting, legal, operations support, information technology and human resource functions. General and administrative expense also includes corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense, including rent, utilities, depreciation and maintenance, as well as legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services. 
 
 We expect that our general and administrative expense will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities, potential commercialization efforts and increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, legal support and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we anticipate increased costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with the requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, director and officer insurance, investor and public relations costs. If any of our current or future product candidates obtains U.S. regulatory approval, we expect that we would incur significantly increased expenses associated with building a sales and marketing team. 
 
 Depreciation 
 
 25 

Depreciation expense relates to the fixed assets which consist mainly of lab equipment. The lab equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life of five years. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net consists primarily of interest earned on our excess cash. 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Since our inception, we have not recorded any income tax benefits for the net operating losses, or NOLs, we have incurred or for our research and development tax credits, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all of our NOLs and tax credits will not be realized. As such, we have a full valuation allowance against all NOLs and tax credits for all periods presented.

Collaboration revenue 
 
 No collaboration revenues were earned during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in budgeted spending for COYA 302. The increase in budgeted spending is a result of communication with the FDA in which the FDA stated that additional non-clinical data must be submitted prior to initiating our planned randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of COYA 302 in patients with ALS. Budgeted spending for COYA 302 includes total forecasted pre-clinical and clinical costs incurred for the advancement of COYA 302 in patients with ALS. R D Services revenue is calculated quarterly using the inputs approach, by applying actual COYA 302 expenses against budgeted COYA 302 expenses as the two inputs. The increase in budgeted COYA 302 expenses offset the actual COYA 302 expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in immaterial movements of R D Services revenue. As such, no R D Services revenue were recorded. In addition, License revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of a license or upon a cumulative catch-up in the event of a contract modification. No licenses were transferred nor were there any contract modifications during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as such no License revenue was recognized. 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses increased by 0.6 million from 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to a 0.3 million increase in our preclinical expenses primarily due to our preclinical advancement of COYA 302 in ALS and a 0.3 million increase in internal research and development expenses. External research and development expenses include fees paid to CROs and CMOs and fees paid to regulatory, clinical trial and manufacturing professional service firms largely in connection with preclinical activities necessary to prepare COYA 302 for its initial IND filing and launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial. We expect these expenses to continue to grow in the fourth quarter of 2024. Once the IND for COYA 302 has been approved, we intend to expand the table below, creating a new class called "Clinical product candidates," wherein we will disclose the clinical expenses for COYA 302. 
 
 26 

We do not further classify or evaluate our internal research and development expenses by product candidate or by Series as these expenses primarily relate to compensation, materials and supplies, and other costs which are deployed across multiple therapeutic modalities, multiple product candidates, and multiple therapeutic areas under development. 
 
 Research and development expenses disaggregated and classified by preclinical, and external and internal expenses are summarized in the table below:

The increase was primarily due to a 0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation and employee headcount, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in corporate fees. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net increased by 0.3 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to interest and dividend income earned on cash balances.

Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses increased by 6.0 million from 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to a 5.0 million increase in our preclinical expenses primarily due to our preclinical advancement of COYA 302 in ALS, 0.2 million increase in sponsored research, and a 0.8 million increase in internal research and development expenses. External research and development expenses include fees paid to CROs and CMOs and fees paid to regulatory, clinical trial and manufacturing professional service firms largely in connection with preclinical activities necessary to prepare COYA 302 for its initial IND filing and launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial.

 General and administrative expenses increased by 1.3 million from 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an 1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation and employee headcount, and a 0.2 million increase in board fees and taxes, partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in office expenses. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 
 Other income, net increased by 0.7 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to interest and dividend income earned on cash balances. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Since our inception, we have incurred operating losses and incurred negative cash flows from our operations through 2023. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. Since our inception through September 30, 2024 we have funded our operations through the sale of convertible promissory notes and convertible preferred stock, our IPO, private securities offerings, and payments from DRL in accordance with the DRL Development Agreement, as amended in June 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 31.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and had an accumulated deficit of 37.8 million. We expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the 10.0 million in gross proceeds from the October 2024 Private Placement, to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2026. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 
 Funding Requirements 
 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, primarily research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. 
 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 
 the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for marketing approval and commercialization; 

the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our product candidates; 

28 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

the costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 

expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

costs associated with being a public company; 

the costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities; 

the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and 

revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval. 

We will need significant additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development expenditures, and business development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies. 
 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening of global economic conditions, potential future global pandemics or health crises, and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit, banking and financial markets in the United States. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Operating Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 7.9 million of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of 12.0 million, partially offset by a 2.2 million net increase from our operating assets and liabilities and noncash charges of 1.9 million primarily related to stock-based compensation. The net increase in our operating assets was mainly related to the receipt of a 7.5 million payment from DRL pursuant to the DRL Development Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 8.9 million of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of 9.3 million and a 0.7 million net decrease in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by noncash charges of 1.1 million related to stock-based compensation and acquired in-process research and development. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations related to the development of our product candidates. 
 
 29 

Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 25,000 of in-process research and development assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we purchased 0.4 million of in-process research and development assets relating to the DRL Agreement. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided 6.3 million of cash from the proceeds received from the sale of common stock of 5.0 million and the exercise of warrants of 1.5 million, partially offset by 0.1 million in payments of offering costs related to the 2023 private placement. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, financing activities provided 14.3 million of cash from the issuance of common stock upon our initial public offering, net of deferred financing costs. 
 
 DRL Development Agreement 
 
 In December 2023, we entered into the DRL Development Agreement with Dr. Reddy's, pursuant to which, among other things, we granted to Dr. Reddy's an exclusive, royalty-bearing right and license to commercialize COYA 302 solely for use in patients with ALS in the United States, Canada, the European Union and the United Kingdom, or collectively, the New Territories. We previously granted DRL an exclusive license to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize COYA 302 for ALS and certain other indications in all other countries (other than the New Territories, Japan, Mexico, and in each country in South America), pursuant to the License and Supply Agreement entered between with DRL, or the DRL Agreement, effective as of April 1, 2023. COYA 302 is comprised of two components, COYA 301 and DRL_AB. In accordance with the DRL Agreement, we in-licensed DRL_AB for the development and commercialization of COYA 302. Further, under the DRL Development Agreement, Dr. Reddy s is responsible for the development of DRL_AB. We will have the responsibility for the clinical development of COYA 302 and for seeking regulatory approval in the United States for COYA 302 in ALS. 
 
 In June 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the DRL Development Agreement, or the First Amendment, with DRL and Dr. Reddy's, pursuant to which, among other things, Dr. Reddy's paid us a one-time payment of 3.9 million and, in return, Dr. Reddy's will have no obligation to pay the first 6.0 million in royalty payments that would have otherwise been payable to us under the DRL Development Agreement. 
 
 The collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee, or JSC, which is comprised of representatives from both parties. Decisions of the JSC are made by consensus. If the JSC is unable to reach a consensus, and the parties executives are not able to resolve the dispute, then Dr. Reddy s has final decision-making authority, subject to specified limitations (as set forth in the DRL Development Agreement). 
 
 Pursuant to the DRL Development Agreement, we received an up-front, nonrefundable payment of 7.5 million in January 2024. Additionally, we are entitled to receive (i) an additional 4.2 million upon FDA acceptance of an IND application for COYA 302 for the treatment of ALS and (ii) an additional 4.2 million payment upon the dosing of the first patient in the first phase 2 clinical trial for COYA 302 for the treatment of ALS in the United States. The DRL Development Agreement also calls for up to an aggregate of 40.0 million in development milestones and up to an aggregate of 677.3 million in sales milestones, related to the New Territories, should all such development and sales milestones be achieved. We will also be owed royalties by Dr. Reddy's on Net Sales (as defined in the DRL Development Agreement) of COYA 302 in the low to mid-teens (prior to paying royalties due pursuant to previously disclosed license agreements related to COYA 302). Pursuant to the First Amendment, as discussed above, the first 6.0 million of royalty payments will not be owed to us. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. We therefore believe that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 30 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. 
 
 Commitments and Contingencies, including License and Sponsored Research Agreements 
 Patent Know How and License Agreement with The Methodist Hospital 
 
 In September 2022, we entered into the Methodist License Agreement with Methodist to make, sell and sublicense products and services using the intellectual property and know-how of Methodist. As part of the Methodist License Agreement, we will pay Methodist a four-figure license maintenance fee annually until the first sale of licensed product occurs. The term of the Methodist License Agreement is effective until no intellectual property patent rights remain, unless terminated sooner by (1) bankruptcy or insolvency, (2) the failure by us to monetize the intellectual property within five years of the date of the agreement (further discussed below), (3) due to breach of contract, or (4) at our election for any or no reason. 
 
 In addition to the equity issuance and reimbursement of patent related expenses, we agreed to make contingent milestone payments to Methodist on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product or Licensed Service-by-Licensed Service basis upon the achievement of certain development, approval and sales milestones (i) related to the treatment of ALS totaling up to 0.3 million in the aggregate, and (ii) related to the treatment of each other indication (that is not ALS) totaling between 0.2 million and up to 0.4 million in the aggregate per indication. We are also required to pay Methodist, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, royalties (subject to customary reductions) equal to 1 to 10 of annual worldwide net sales of such licensed product during a defined royalty term. The applicable royalty percentage increases as Licensed Products are used to treat from one to more than three indications and if a given Licensed Product utilizes only T-reg cell therapy or is a combination of both T-reg cell therapy and exosomes. Therefore, the lowest tier is paid when there is only a single indication being addressed with a single product. The highest tier is paid only on combination products where there are three or more indications being served. We are also required to pay a low single digit percentage for certain licensed services. We are required to pay royalties at between 10 -20 of sublicense revenue. Commencing on January 1, 2025, the minimum amount which will be owed by us once commercialization occurs is 0.1 million annually. 
 
 The Methodist License Agreement provides that in the event we sublicense products and services covered by the Methodist License Agreement, then royalties owed to Houston Methodist would be computed as a percentage of payments received by us from the sublicensee. In addition, the termination provisions provide that Houston Methodist may only terminate the Methodist License Agreement, among other things, in the event that after five years we are not Actively Attempting to Develop or Commercialize, as such term is defined in the Methodist License Agreement. 
 
 Sponsored Research Agreement with Houston Methodist Research Institute 
 
 In May 2023, we executed a Sponsored Research Agreement, or SRA, with Houston Methodist Research Institute, or HMRI, in which we agreed to fund approximately 0.5 million through May 2024. We subsequently amended the SRA in June 2024 to extend the term through September 2025 and increase agreed funding from 0.5 million to 1.0 million in total funding. 
 
 ARScience License Agreement 
 
 In August 2022, we entered into the ARS License Agreement with ARS pursuant to which ARS granted us an option to, if we choose to exercise such option, to acquire an exclusive, royalty-bearing license for two patents regarding certain formulations of IL-2 (the product that serves as the basis for COYA 301), with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers under these patents. In consideration for the ARS Option, we paid ARS a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable option fee of 0.1 million. 
 
 On December 1, 2022, we exercised the ARS Option by written notice to ARS, or the Option Exercise Notice. Upon the delivery of the Option Exercise Notice (such date of delivery, the Effective Date ), ARS automatically was deemed to have granted to us the licenses and all provisions of the ARS License Agreement and the ARS License Agreement became effective as of the Effective Date. Pursuant to the terms of the ARS License Agreement, we paid to ARS a mid-six-figure up-front fee. 
 
 In addition, we may also owe tiered payments to ARS based on our achievement of certain developmental milestones. Under the ARS License Agreement, we will pay an aggregate of 13.3 million in developmental milestone payments for the first Combination Product (as defined in the ARS License Agreement) in a new indication. We will then pay an aggregate of 11.6 million in developmental milestone payments for each Combination Product in each subsequent new indication. Further, for the first Mono Product (as defined in the ARS License Agreement), we will pay an aggregate of 11.8 million in developmental milestone payments. We will then pay an aggregate of 5.9 million in developmental milestone payments for each Mono Product in each subsequent new indication, and we will owe an aggregate of 5.9 million if all developmental milestones are achieved for each new indication. We will also owe royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to mid-single digit percentages. In the event we sublicense our rights under the ARS 
 31 

License Agreement, we will owe royalties on sublicense income within the range of 10 to 20 . To date, the 0.1 million option fee and the mid-six-figure up-front fee (upon exercise of the ARS Option) are the only payments made to ARS under the ARS License Agreement. 
 
 Dr. Reddy's License and Supply Agreement 
 
 In March 2023, we entered into the DRL Agreement with DRL. The DRL Agreement became effective on April 1, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the DRL Agreement, we will in-license DRL_AB to be used in the development and commercialization of COYA 302 in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, South America, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Japan. In consideration for the license, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront fee of 0.4 million. We will pay to DRL up to an aggregate of approximately 2.9 million of pre-approval regulatory milestone payments for the first indication in the Field (as defined in the DRL Agreement) and an additional approximately 20.0 million if all other development, regulatory approval and sales milestones are incurred under the DRL Agreement. We will also pay to DRL a low-six figure milestone payment per additional indication. Further, pursuant to the DRL Agreement, we will pay to DRL single-digit royalties on Net Sales (as defined in the DRL Agreement).

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. From time to time, we make changes to our internal control over financial reporting that are intended to enhance its effectiveness and which do not have a material effect on our overall internal control over financial reporting.
